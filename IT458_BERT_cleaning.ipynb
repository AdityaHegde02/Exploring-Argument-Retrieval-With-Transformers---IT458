            "[\"The resolution used by Pro *assumes* that Australia isn't already a 'significant' country - however, in actual reality, it is. Firstly we should clarify what significance means: 1.a the state or quality of being significant1.b of consequence or importance==================================To respond directly to Pros argument first:he/she asserts that Australia invented 'amazing things' like 'WiFI, Google Maps, Polymer bank notes, Ultrasound scanners, stainless steel braces and many more things'. Now, if these inventions did come from Australia, then, it can be considered a 'significant country' - as a country which is the home of some of the most universally-used inventions in the 21st century. It would seem that Pro was/is trying to argue that Australia simply deserves more recognition, in which case he/she should proposed that instead of stating that it should be more 'significant' - because the examples that Pro themselves has listed, fully go against that. Instead of affirming the resolution, Pro has negated it. After all, insignificant countries do not invent things such as WiFi or Google Maps. One invention listed by Pro that I will take issue with though is the ultrasound, as this was not invented in Australia. Its first use is thought to have been in Austria, which is a country in Europe. Its technology developed from there. 'The use of ultrasound in medicine began during and shortly after the 2nd World War in various centres around the world. The work of Dr. Karl Theodore Dussik in Austria in 1942 on transmission ultrasound investigation of the brain provides the first published work on medical ultrasonics.' 'Although other workers in the USA, Japan and Europe have also been cited as pioneers, the work of Professor Ian Donald and his colleagues in Glasgow, in the mid 1950s, did much to facilitate the development of practical technology and applications.'[1.] https://www.bmus.org...\", 'I accept.', 'First of all we invented amazing things like WiFi, Google Maps, Polymer bank notes (if you are American and do not know what they are, they are plastic WATERPROOF bills), Ultrasound scanners, stainless steel braces and many more things. Why put us into the shadow if we have made such amazing things the whole world uses nowadays! I bet you have used at the very least ONE thing I put up there unless you are on a Ethernet cable still using those old paper maps wherever you go! There is no point in putting such smart people who made these things in the shadow! Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!', 'Australia has always been put into the shadow behind countries like America, Canada and even England sometimes, I feel Australia should not be put in the darkness and in this debate I will tell you why.', 'Alright then.', 'A forfeit? Alright. Unexpected.', '* Paragraph 1 is simply you writing 67 words in a row and having none of them relate to the current topic of debate. There was no reason to have that paragraph except to make you appear more intelligent. This is meaningless as your further arguments clarify that you are intelligent and I ask you refrain from attempting this in further debates. I feel no further need to address it. * \" Its not YOUR religion. You don\"t own it. \" this is true. I do not own my religion. However, How would you like me to refer to it as? If I always adressed it as: \"The religion that I, As a christian, Believe in, \" It would lead to run-on sentences and spotty grammar. \"My religion\" Is much faster, However I will try to refrain from using that term in the future. If you spot it, Please inform me. * \"Why try at all? \" You are very well educated and I\\'m confused that with your knowledge of the bible you do not know the answer to this. All Christians have been commissioned to spread our belief\\'s throughout the world, As can be seen throughout the new testament (ex Matthew 28: 1-20). My question is this: why do you try? For what purpose do you waste your time debating on this website, Trying to convince people you know in advance are set on their beliefs? You have nothing to gain. Even if you convince someone, So what? Their just another person across the globe on a debating website who is now a atheist. I can\\'t see how it affects you at all. *\"Which first paragraph? \" My apologies. I see now my opening argument was poorly labeled. You were correct in assuming I was referring to Leviticus 14:33-57. I will try in the future to better label my arguments *\"Sooooo many problems with that one. 1. First you have to demonstrate, Test and thus prove your god exists in which case nobody has ever done in the entire existence of the human race. 2. Which means there\"s no such a thing as any miracles 3. Suppose someone does manage to prove your god then you would have to assert this god exists to the rest of the world with over 33, 000 denominations of Christianity alone. Now I don\"t mean to sound insulting, But tee hee! So which denomination of YOUR Christianity is correct? . \" I will address this point by point. In that argument, I did not have to prove the existence of God. You had made the argument that if God did exist, He would not tell the Israelites such outlandish things. Since you were working on the basis that God existed, My rebuttal to that argument did not need to prove the existence of God. If these were different circumstances, Yes, I would need to prove the existence of God. This also applies to 2, So I will take this time to address something else. All throughout your debate, You use quotation marks instead of apostrophe\\'s (ex there\"s). Please refrain from this in the future. In point number 3, You claim there is \"33, 000\". I have no clue where you got this absurd number from, As you did not provide a source. I can\\'t even find a hundredth of that many denominations, And so I must believe you pulled that number from thin air. You ask which denomination is correct. To which I answer this. I do not know. As I have said multiple times in advance, I do not have all knowledge. I simply try to do the best I can with what little knowledge I have. * \"It really p**ses me off that supposed christians like you who are not christians at all, Because there is no such a thing as being a christian, And you just proved it, Because you nor anyone can possibly pay any attention to YOUR god\"s laws that are befitting by your god in your lap. No! You and every other supposed christian has to make up their own rules to what suits them, To how they want, To their needs and desires\" I could take potshots at this, Pointing out the poor conduct and the run on sentences. However you have addressed in advance you do not care about conduct despite this being a formal debate. Instead, I ask this question of you. If we \"make up their own rules to what suits them\" why do we follow such restricting rules? Why would we believe that you shouldn\\'t lust, Or lie, When those things could benefit us? If we made the rules, Why would we make the rules so hard to follow? But if a unfathomable God made the rules, It would only make sense that the standard would be harder, As we are not gods. * \"Regardless your god MURDERED 2, 821, 364 in YOUR bible, \" Again, You pull out a incredibly specific number (2, 821, 364) with no source. I ask you to back up these numbers in the future. Regardless, I do not believe that there is a verse you can pull up that cannot be justified. You have left two of my earlier points un-rebbuted, Instead choosing to simply rage quit. Regardless, I know in advance that the two us will never come to a agreement. I also know that the likelihood of me winning this debate is slim, As even a idiot could see that you are far better educated and experienced. If you do not want to continue this debate, Simply inform me. As always, I look forward to your response.', 'Here I am again, Knowing full well that it is likely you will best me. Regardless, I would be a disgrace to my religion if I did not try. I will try to rebut your points. I hope that I meet your criteria, But regardless if I do not I will debate to the best of my abilities. If you consider me non-intelligent (which is unfortunately likely), Please tell me upfront so I may leave the debate as respectively as I can. * Your first paragraph details how you believe that the bible is man made. However, Allow me to explain how your point is flawed. The outlandishness of the law is not proof that the bible is man-made, Quite the opposite. If God had simply told the Israelites a practical way to cure leprosy (chemically engineer dapsone), Then it would not be a miracle. However, If God chose the most outlandish set of instructions and the lepers were healed, Then Israel could not deny it was a miracle. This was needed because Israel had the habit of instantaneously following other gods that allowed them to have no rules or restrictions. * You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. As the old proverb goes, \"Blood leads to blood. Violence into more violence. Revenge is just another name for Murder\". You also forget that the man who was slain gains eternal riches in the next life. If that muderer continues to do evil, He will receive damnation * One: that verse was a parable. Here is a source explaining it https://www. Biblestudytools. Com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-19-12. Html. Two: even if it was not a parable, We are talking a God that created the laws of physics. Nothing is physically impossible * Here is a source explaining that verse: http://apologeticspress. Org/apcontent. Aspx? Category=6&article=301 *\"Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one Jesus? After all this Christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. \" Jesus was not sent to stop physical war on earth. Jesus was sent to stop the spiritual war that had been raging on since satan\\'s fall. Because the 80 years we live on this earth is a pittance compared to the 1000\\'s on 1000\\'s we live afterwards. As for those who started such wars without cause, They will be damned. Conclusion: I will not claim to have all knowledge. I will not claim to be the smartest in my nation or my religion or even of my family. However, Even a fool such as I know this. The bible, A book that is constantly under fire, Has managed to survive and flourish since 4000 b. C. In between then and now it has been threatened by some of the most powerful men in the world (ex. Adolf Hitler who aimed to burn all religious materials) and has survived. It has stood against the harshest critics including scientists, Philosophers, And historians all of whom failed to find deceisive evidence that the bible was false. And that seems like a miracle too me. Regardless, I thank you for your time', 'Why is it that so-called christians, Because there is no such a thing as a christian, Have serious trouble as READING and COMPREHENDING? Its not that difficult, Nor is it that hard. It was stated unto you a very simple \"* \"You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. \" OK we\"re done. You paid absolutely no attention whatsoever to the verses presented and instead went off into your own la la land. \" But nah, All you did was babble on and on and on. So in this sense, It was YOU that forfeited. Sheesh! Bye.', '\"Here I am again, \" Are you sure its you? You know you could be somebody else pretending to be you. Did you pinch yourself to make sure its you and or put a bullet in your kneecaps to make sure its you? Probably not. So then you don\"t know if its you in a flabbergassesed reality of your own making then you have no idea as to what is the outcome of your past being part of your present future. Right? Anyway\" \"Regardless, I would be a disgrace to my religion\"\" See right there you fumble. Its not YOUR religion. You don\"t own it. And you most certainly don\"t own your superior ego god complex in which your joke of a bible is entirely about and nothing else, In which you cannot prove its immoral god even exists as the verses stated in RD1 prove. They are completely laughable at best in which no god of sheer stupidity would even dream about composing. But then again, No god of superior ego god complex would ever, Not for any reason, Dream of using text, Namely your bible as a form of communication, Transmission, Correspondence, Conformity, Publication etc pe-ir-od. \"if I did not try\" Well see, Why try at all? Why try for a completely immoral character that your god unquestionably is and your bible without a doubt proves this? But only if you\"ve read and comprehended the damn thing. Did you do this? \"If you consider me non-intelligent (which is unfortunately likely), \" No. I consider you to be not knowing any better and defending something that you cannot possibly defend. * \"Your first paragraph details how you believe that the bible is man made. \" Which first paragraph? 2 Timothy 3:16, Proverbs 30:5, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Rules for this debate, The biggest laugh in the bible? Leviticus 14:33-57? Oh I see, Its NOT the first paragraph in the bible, Its Leviticus 14:33-57 in which is wayyyyyyy down the ladder. Nitpicking am I? No because its very hard to follow you. \"However, Allow me to explain how your point is flawed. \" Actually its not. No \"god\" would ---ever--- be stupid enough, With a full octane of nothing but drab to invent such bombastic impressioned imperfect silliness. It really is that simple. So since this is ultimately true, And no supposed laughing toodles \"god\" would horrifically be flat out ignorant enough to invent that law, Then who and or what did? I get it from your standpoint. It must be a blade of grass, Or a playbore bunny, A you know where area itch that won\"t go away, A god from the undergrowth from another planet. Hey, You\\'ve got trillions of choices. So why not use them? Sheesh! Oh but wait! There yah go inventing excuses as always because YOU DON\"T KNOW ANY BETTER! \"If God had simply told the Israelites a practical way to cure leprosy (chemically engineer dapsone), Then it would not be a miracle. \" Wow. *zzzzz* many sleepless nights with that one buckey. Yeah my patience wears thin. Sooooo many problems with that one. 1. First you have to demonstrate, Test and thus prove your god exists in which case nobody has ever done in the entire existence of the human race. 2. Which means there\"s no such a thing as any miracles 3. Suppose someone does manage to prove your god\" then you would have to assert this god exists to the rest of the world with over 33, 000 denominations of christianity alone. Now I don\"t mean to sound insulting, But tee hee! So which denomination of YOUR christianity is correct? \"However, If God chose the most outlandish set of instructions and the lepers were healed, Then Israel could not deny it was a miracle. \" That really is one helluva super duper way way gone from this universe truly whacked out invented excuse. You KNOW how much I truly hate them. Any more of them, Bye bye me in having anything to do with you and this debate will be over. It really p**ses me off that supposed christians like you who are not christians at all, Because there is no such a thing as being a christian, And you just proved it, Because you nor anyone can possibly pay any attention to YOUR god\"s laws that are befitting by your god in your lap. No! You and every other supposed christian has to make up their own rules to what suits them, To how they want, To their needs and desires. Its truly ridiculous. * \"You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. \" OK we\"re done. You paid absolutely no attention whatsoever to the verses presented and instead went off into your own la la land. Regardless your god MURDERED 2, 821, 364 in YOUR bible in which included babies, Children and pregnant mothers (abortions) in which you christians perfectly justify, That is IF and it is a MUST IF you believe in YOUR god in which committed numerous genocides for absolutely no reason at all. So have fun in believing in your supermassive contradictory hypocritical unproven god. Yeah its perfectly OK for your god to murder, But not man? But wait, Your god orders man to murder for him? Wow. Bye. Do you want some REAL truth? Simply google it. Google something like \"bible verses where god kills babies\".', '2 Tiimothy 3:16 \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, And is profitable for doctrine, For reproof, For correction, For instruction in righteousness:\" Proverbs 30:5 \"Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. \" Welcome welcome welcome to the silliness absurdities in god and the bible and why you should not believe in god for obvious reasons: Rules for this debate: 1. I will not stand for those who are unintelligent nor those who are uneducated and yet you try to pretend that you are. . . 2. Especially if you try to pretend you know what they are squawking about when you really don\"t. 3. If #\"s1 and 2 occur, I will either ignore you or I will slam you with original insults of mine that will show you to be the reareth endeth that you truly are. 4. Conduct in the voting stage is to be removed and cannot be voted upon. 5. Disqualified from any voting procedure is dsjpk5. Ok ready - set - GO! * This to me is the biggest laugh in the bible. Reading it its truly hilarious. In no way would any supreme deity -ever- concoct this obvious man made, And what MAN would think this trash heap up, Law up, Put it into effect and expect anybody to believe it AND expect everybody to follow it? I really like the use of a bird for solutions. Does anybody buy this dippy cabbage batbrain obnoxious stuff gunk? Well yeah. If you are uneducated and unintelligent and you believe in god. Leviticus 14:33-57 \"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, Saying, 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, Which I give to you for a possession, And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, Saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, Before the priest go into it to see the plague, That all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: 37 And he shall look on the plague, And, Behold, If the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, Greenish or reddish, Which in sight are lower than the wall; 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, And shut up the house seven days: 39And the priest shall come again the seventh day, And shall look: and, Behold, If the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, And they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, And they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 42 And they shall take other stones, And put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, And shall plaister the house. 43 And if the plague come again, And break out in the house, After that he hath taken away the stones, And after he hath scraped the house, And after it is plaistered; 44 Then the priest shall come and look, And, Behold, If the plague be spread in the house, It is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 45 And he shall break down the house, The stones of it, And the timber thereof, And all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 48 And if the priest shall come in, And look upon it, And, Behold, The plague hath not spread in the house, After the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, Because the plague is healed. 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, And cedar wood, And scarlet, And hyssop: 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, And the hyssop, And the scarlet, And the living bird, And dip them in the blood of the slain bird, And in the running water, And sprinkle the house seven times: 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, And with the running water, And with the living bird, And with the cedar wood, And with the hyssop, And with the scarlet: 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, And make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, And scall, 55 And for the leprosy of a garment, And of a house, 56 And for a rising, And for a scab, And for a bright spot: 57 To teach when it is unclean, And when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. \" Yep. People\"s limbs falling off while they are waiting for a bird to do unto them magical prowess is such a stroke of utter hypnotic comedic failure that is god and the bible. Only a completely insane man or woman could have made that one up. Yes, Without a doubt god and the bible are clearly man made. * This is how the bible and god investigates a murder. Yes with great envy, This is how our court system should absolutely 100% work in this country! Why not? Thankfully we have intelligence, Dignity and integrity, Unlike god and the bible. Great going with all your smarts and brain activity god. Keep it going! This is a true joke unto itself and why god and the bible cannot possibly be taken seriously. . . . Deuteronomy 21: 1-9 \"If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, Lying in the field, And it be not known who hath slain him: 2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, And they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 3 And it shall be, That the city which is next unto the slain man, Even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, Which hath not been wrought with, And which hath not drawn in the yoke; 4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, Which is neither eared nor sown, And shall strike off the heifer\\'s neck there in the valley: 5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, And to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 6 And all the elders of that city, That are next unto the slain man, Shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, Neither have our eyes seen it. 8 Be merciful, O LORD, Unto thy people Israel, Whom thou hast redeemed, And lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel\\'s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, When thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. \" Indeed so this is how according to the laws of the bible that how to investigate a murder should that place? Well appoint me as a judge so I can insanely let everybody go! * Matthew 19:12 \"For there are some eunuchs, Which were so born from their mother\\'s womb: and there are some eunuchs, Which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, Which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\\'s sake. He that is able to receive it, Let him receive it. \" Um yeah um OK well that\"s physically impossible and could -never- happen. Duh. Regardless, Its a pretty sick verse. But what can one expect emanating from the sickest book ever written? * Judges 1:19 \"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, Because they had chariots of iron. \" Wow. God must be that weak. Since this mighty god has no power against the weak chariots of iron, One has to wonder if he has the power to defeat a gamma ray burst should one come this way? Clearly a misprint in the bible or god is man made. * Here\\'s a thinking, Rationalizing, Reasoning, Common sense, Logical question(s) (there are too many to count) in which religion, God and the bible has none: Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one jesus? After all this christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. . . Evil, Anger, Vengeance, Rage, Fury, Jealousy etc. Clearly more than one jesus was needed, Required and was necessary to have carried out god\"s word to have provided peace, Love, Care and kindness. But let\"s be honest here, That\"s not what god wanted, Otherwise he would have sent more than one jesus. He would have sent hundreds, Thousands, Millions. They could have all spoken in the same tongue that god would have wanted them to have spoken in. OR HERE\"S THE KICKER, HE COULD HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF! But its clear that god didn\"t want any of this. God instead wants turmoil and hate, Not peace by any means. Its what keeps god in office and gives him a job. After all what happens if the world happens to live in peace? God would have nothing to do. No one to b**ch at. No one to rule. No one to murder. No one to make war with. For all of those who have answered \"Only one jesus was needed\", Well you\"ve just answered your own question with an answer. Your precious jesus, In which there is absolutely no proof for him having ever existed in the first place as well as god, Is why there is so much hatred in this world. * Summary: The bible is littered with rules and regulations that no god/ supreme deity would -ever- put into play and much less expect people to believe, Much less live by them. Yet the bible is supposed to be perfect in every way. So is god. Clearly both are not. Since this is true, God, The bible and christianity should not in any way be worshiped, Idolized, Bowed down to nor yielded to.', 'Thanks to PRO for his/her response and for returning to the debate. I will be taking PRO\\'s arguments in the final round into consideration seeing that he has been subject to unfair circumstances. I will start off by addressing PRO\\'s rebuttals against my case and then proceed to argue against his substantives.Defences against PRO\\'s rebuttals D1) Rebuttal 1PRO concedes to the fact that this \"might be true\", then makes an attempt to rebuke this by saying that he personally finds this very difficult. This is by no means adequate justification that Person A is on the back foot from the very start of a debate. What is difficult for PRO might be easy for another debater due to disparities in knowledge of the topic, debating proficiency and other factors. PRO needs to bring to the table factual and concrete analysis of the nature and roles of Person A and B that is consistent for all debaters, which he has not done so, to prove that Person A does indeed have a more difficult job to fulfill.D2) Rebuttal 2PRO\\'s response to this point does not yield any strength for his stance. He relates the purpose of debate which to convince the opponent with the emphasis that DDO\\'s voting mechanism places on arguments. My point about Person A slacking off was to prove the proportionate nature of difficulty between the two sides of the house, not to disprove the inherent attributes of a debate. Besides, both Person A and B are judged based off of the same voting criteria, thus this does not clash with my case which argues for the conditional equilibrium between the two sides of the house.D3) Rebuttal 3APRO seeks to rebut this by citing his personal experience in flame wars, which manufactures two mistakes. Firstly, this is an anecdotal fallacy [1], in no way is PRO\\'s experience an accurate representation of the reality of flame wars on YouTube. Even if we disregard this, PRO has not proved how flame wars can be classified as a form of debate, as he/she personally admits, hence this argument is not relevant to the motion.D4) Rebuttal 3BPRO states that both sides of the house don\\'t have equal facilities, but leaves this point hanging and does not further this with any reasoning, thus this point is negligible. He/she has also stated that \"people rebut original points only\" and don\\'t take the initiative to conjure up points of their own. In reference to my previous argument, the specifications for winning a debate do not concern the originality of the arguments. Furthermore, doesn\\'t selectively rebutting points grant a free win for whoever is coming up with said \\'original arguments\\'? How does this correlate with PRO\\'s stance that it is actually harder for the person who has to come up with original arguments (assuming that originality even matters anyway)?D5) Rebuttal 4PRO responds to this by saying that Person A gets less opportunities to rebut and present arguments, and clarifies that this debate actually encompasses Internet debates and that my arguments are less effective under this premise. Under the framework of DDO debate, Person A and B both get the same amount of chances to rebut and present arguments, it is simply a matter of who gets the last say. This is also the case with other styles of debate such as World Schools Style and British Parliamentary. I personally would like to decline PRO\\'s modification of the term \\'debate\\' from formal and structured discussions like DDO to ones found on YouTube. Those are aptly named flame wars and not debates for a reason. As such, I do not wish to see my arguments invalidated just because PRO failed to fulfill his/her burden of clarifying what \\'debate\\' means in the acceptance round.D6) Rebuttal 5BThese points do not contradict each other if you have factored in another portion of my argument, which states that Person A has the advantage of sculpting the debate (i.e. the definitions, scope of debate, additional rules) which compensates for the fact Person A does not have the last say in a debate. Even if we discount this, PRO still has to prove that in ALL cases of a debate, the person who is the first to deliver an argument is NEVER the last one to speak in order to uphold this point, which is not true. In World Schools Style for example, the Proposition/Government (equivalent to PRO on DDO) starts off the debate with their first speaker, but is also the side that concludes the debate with their reply speaker [2].Rebuttals against PRO\\'s substantivesR1) Point 1This argument does not stand for two reasons:1. PRO\\'s argument is entirely based off of the functionings of DDO debate, but forgets that this motion does not only concern DDO debates but \\'debates\\' as a whole. Debates can occur in real life, and one is not given the option of cherrypicking which debates to participate in in real life debates. Once again, I am aware that PRO wishes to amend the purview of the term \\'debate\\' to mean online debates, but I do not approve of this amendment as aforementioned as defining terms should only be conducted in the first round.2. PRO acknowledges that there are cases where Person B cannot preselect which debates to take part in based on the content that Person A has posted in the first round by raising the example of Person A using the first round as an acceptance round. Bear in mind that the motion states that \"Debates are harder when you are the first one to come up with points\", which, unless per specific explication by PRO, means that PRO will have to justify that debates are ALWAYS more difficult for Person A. By providing the example of the acceptance round scenario, PRO has essentially disproved this him/herself.Even if both of these counterarguments do not stand, PRO\\'s argument is still insufficient in justifying his stance for the reason that Person A is given the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate his/her decision to instigate a debate in much the same way that Person B is given the opportunity to consider accepting a debate or not. More importantly, Person A is entitled to choosing what topic to debate on based on his/her strengths and weaknesses as well as preferences in the same way that Person B can choose which debates to engage in according to their proficiency of the matters discussed in the motion. Furthermore, both sides of the house are unaware of the ability of their opponents to-be as they most likely do not know their opponent in person given that the opponent\\'s profile information is true in the first place. Thus, all factors accounted for, it is not more difficult for Person A simply because Person B is able to decide which debates to participate in.ConclusionTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points and defended against all of PRO\\'s offenses against my case. I have argued that the conditions are the same as well as the burdens for both sides of the house and justified any inconsistencies between Person A and Person B, thus I have effectively proved that both sides are inherently equal to one another in terms of difficulty, and any further dissimilarities in difficulty can be traced back to the varying competencies between the two debaters.Thank you to PRO for such an interesting debate and all audience members and potential voters for your attention. Vote CON!Sources used[1] https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org...', \"It is a shame that my opponent has forfeited, I hope that all is well for him of late. As such, I will not be posting new arguments in this round and will extend my previous arguments. Please may I remind PRO that no new arguments will be presented in the next round by either side of the house as it is the final round of the debate. On a different note, I forgot to post the link of the webpage I referenced the definition of 'hard' from. Here it is:http://dictionary.reference.com...Thank you.\", 'May the best debater win! In addition to the content posted in Round 1, PRO also wishes to deliver this argument that he forgot to post in Round 1:All your points are concentrated into one postIn real life, you have limited time on what you can say. However, here you have 10000 characters. I\\'d say that\\'s enough to squeeze in 10 points. .. Imagine saying 10 points in 3 minutes. That\\'d be impossible. DEFINITIONSHard: Difficult to do or accomplish; fatiguing; troublesome [1]. BURDEN OF PROOFPRO must prove that debates are harder for those who are the first to deliver their arguments. CON must prove either that debates are easier for those who are the first to deliver their arguments or that debates are equally difficult/easy for both sides of the house. Note: For the sake of efficiency, I will be referring to the person who delivers their arguments first as \\'Person A\\' and his opposition as \\'Person B\\'. REBUTTALSR1) \"The one accepting the challenge can just read it and pick out the points you thought and debate on them. .. \"There is no evidence that this makes the debate difficult for Person A. How easy it is for the opposition to pick out flaws in your argument is proportionate to how well you fabricate your arguments. So to speak, if you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don\\'t put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points. Furthermore, what PRO has not talked about is that picking on the opposition\\'s points and \"thinking hard for points to support your view\" is a shared burden for both sides of the house. Person B who \"can just read it and pick out the points\" is also obliged to come up with substantives to uphold his stance, and Person A in turn has the responsibility to rebut those points and establish new arguments, and this continues until the last round. As one can see, both sides of the house have the same onus and hence no side is harder than another in this respect. R2) \". .. people usually don\\'t use original points beyond the opening statement, at least in the Internet. \"Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis. Thus, we can only go as far as saying that this is an opinionated statement by PRO. Even if we assume this to be true, we don\\'t see how this creates a disparity between Person A and Person B. Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarise points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion. R3) *please refer to PRO\\'s additional argument at the top*I don\\'t really know what to make of this argument. PRO compares debating on DDO with debating in real life through talking about word limits and time constraints, but does not proceed to make the connection between such a comparison and the difficulty discrepancy between Person A and Person B. As far as DDO is concerned (assuming that this debate is oriented around online debates seeing that PRO talks about the Internet and \\'accepting challenges\\'), both sides of the house are subjected to the same time constraints and word limits, thus this argument is hollow in the scope of this debate. SUBSTANTIVESP1) Same burdens, same conditionsBoth sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within. In the most generic sense, each side of the house must successfully uphold their stance and rebut their opponent\\'s points/rebuttals against their points to win the debate. The specifications for victory are the same, and hence it is not intrinsically more difficult for one side of the house to take the debate. There are, however, some slight differences in terms of what Person A and Person B are required to do in order to meet these specifications. Person A, for instance, has to characterise the problem and justify that it is indeed an issue in the status quo. Some may argue that this gives Person A an advantage because they may shape the debate to be in their favour. To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the \\'last say\\', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round. This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A. CONCLUSIONTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points thus far and have demonstrated to you that a debate is structured in such a way that it allots the same context for each side of the house to debate within, and assigns the same goals for both sides to accomplish. A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B. Thank you and I await PRO\\'s response.', \"Words to Begin the Debate with First off, I apologize for forfeiting the round. I have had some issues with logging in that is now fortunately resolved[1]. I will have to point out that I am only at Grade 8, and have never encountered debates this formal. However, I will try my best to defend my point. Also, my points were targeted to the general internet, not specifically debate.org despite what I said. Sorry for the confusion. Rebuttals Rebuttal 1 “…no evidence that this makes the debate difficult for Person A.” While this might be true, I personally find it very difficult. This might be a personal thing though, and everyone has their opinions, especially over the internet, where lots of people, and naturally, lots of kinds of people are in. Rebuttal 2 “If you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don't put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points.” Again, while this might be true, isn’t debates all about convincing people to support either side? More points makes your arguments more convincing, and more valid rebuttals are also more convincing. According to debate.org’s 7 Point System (Source: http://www.debate.org...) “Who made more convincing arguments?” Is Worth the most marks (3). Therefore, even debate.org agrees that making arguments is important. While this might do nothing to support my point, I’d like to point that out. Rebuttal 3a “Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis.” I have participated in LOTS of flame wars on YouTube, and other sites. Almost None of them provide original points, or maybe just points that are overused, even insults. As a matter of fact, insults make up the most. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) There ARE differences between flame wars and proper debates, however, not everyone is as professional as you. Like me. Some debate like normal flame wars. Again, some. Not many, not all. Rebuttal 3b “Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarize points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion.” While that is true, I don’t think that they have completely equal facilities. However, this doesn’t matter. I have also pointed out that most people rebut original points only and doesn’t come up with any on the internet. Plus, they never cite any. Rebuttal 4 “Both sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within.” Please Refer to Rebuttal 3b. Plus, Person A gets one less chance to rebut to prove their point, especially since internet debates go on for infinite lengths, like 200 comments. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) Again, I apologize for the confusion, but my points were targeted to the general internet, which makes your points less effective. Rebuttal 5 “To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the 'last say', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round.” While this is very true in Debate.org, it’s not in the internet. Please do not let this point affect your rating towards Con though, It was my fault. Rebuttal 5b (1) “This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A.” (2) “A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B.” I personally think Point (1) and Point (2) Conflict. I think that the fact that you can’t rebut someone is very unfair, which adds to the unfairness of Person A. Person A loses 2 chances to rebut their Opponent, while Person B loses none. While I do understand that this is a counterargument, I have made more convincing ones in Middle School, that shows that the Counterarguments actually is a benefit, or is worth losing for. This is a debate on debates so I’d like to point that out. Arguments Point 0: Read me first If CON wants to, he can ignore the arguments, and pretend that I haven’t made any new arguments. As I had some account issues, I forfeited against my will, therefore I think it’s unfair to not let me make additional arguments. If CON disagrees however, he can ignore all my points. Point 0b: All my points I made in my Rebuttals Point 1: Everyone can see your arguments, and if they don’t know how to rebut them, they’ll skip While this might be untrue for those who uses Round 1 as an acceptance round, I personally don’t do so. I think it’s a waste rounds which is already not enough, especially since there is no time limit, or a time limit short enough to bother. If one is not confident on what they see on what Person A says, they’ll skip, and think their points thoroughly before coming back and accepting the challenge. If they fail todo so, they’ll simply ignore. If Person B’s arguments is so good they didn’t know what to say, they can’t withdraw, and will have to forfeit their rounds, which makes Person A seem bad, which ADDS to the unfairness. While the same might apply to Person B too, it does less. Plus, Person A doesn’t have an opportunity to pass, while Person B does. Conclusion While I might have not rebutted all points made by Con, I have rebutted most of them. A debate has many unfair places, especially for Person A. Points are shown to everybody before they accept them, Person B gets the final say. I’d like to apologize again for my misleading points. This time, My point targets specifically debate.org. However, that might have a chance to get ignored. -- NOTES -- [1] I do not have proof, so you'll have to trust what I say.

Well guess what? The one accepting the challenge can just read it and pick out the points you thought and debate on them. Then you debate their debate. Then it goes down that way. As we all know, people usually don't use original points beyond the opening statement, at least in the Internet.\", '\"You appear to be halfway insulting me and halfway arguing your case.\" Yeah I have a really, really bad habit of doing that in debates and ive been trying to kick it for a while now.... Unfortunately ive only made minor progress.', '1) Too little time\"It can be done one country at a time, over a period of 100 or 200 years.\"Theres too many countries for that to be an option though.... Over half the countries in the world have to deal with extreme poverty, and if the US and wealthy nations were to focus one country at a time for 20 years like your original plan suggests, then it would only be able to help 5-10 countries. That still leaves a large chunk of the world without any form of aid while still financially criplling the wealthy nations2) The US and other countries don\\'t have enough money:\"If done over a long period of time the money needed shouldn\\'t overwhelm the nations doing the giving.\"Thats EXACTLY what will happen dingus... Youre proposing that wealthy nations dump hundreds of billions of dollars into poor countries every year for 100-200 years, its a fact that such a policy would financially cripple even the wealthiest of nations such as the US3) Dumping Billions into a country doesnt work\"We didn\\'t hire the Iraqis and Afghans to rebuild their infrastructure. Not as far as I know, anyway.\"Yeah we did, thats the only thing we\\'ve been doing in both of those countries for the last 8 years. http://www.defense.gov...http://www.nytimes.com...4) The US and wealthy nations cant just overtake poor countries and rebuild them\"So a nation doesn\\'t have a right to help another nation on its feet?\"Thats not what im saying idiot.... The argument was that the US and other nations cant actually control the money they are giving to the poor nation and that they have to simply trust it to the local government that runs the poor nation.... And that time and time again that has shown to be problematic since poor countries tend to have horrendously inefficient and corrupted governments that would completely screw up handling hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid a year.....5) Many Poor Countries Don\\'t Have a Lot of Farmland:\"With today\\'s technology, including fertilizers and stuff like that, I\\'m sure we could make that land arable.\"Dude you cant turn a desert into farmland, and even if you could Africa doesnt exactly have a bountiful supply of water to maintain such a farmhttp://thewaterproject.org...6) The Program Relies on Idiotic Assumptions:\" I think the program would work, if done properly.\"But it WONT be done properly because it never HAS been done properly..... Dumping trillions into a country to improve it has shown to not work at all, and youre ignoring that simply because you \\'think\\' that this time it will be different.', 'Reasons why this program wouldnt work in a million years:1) There are simply too many poor countries in the world to dump billions into. Pro\\'s program focuses entirely on Haiti at first, which has less than 0.15% of the global population, and then claims that if it will work in Haiti then it can work in the rest of the world.... The problem is though that the world consists of downtrodden countries that are WAAAAAAAAAY bigger and more populated than Haiti, and improving the wealth of those nations will dwarf the cost it takes to fix up a country as small as Haiti....... Countries like Zimbabwe, India, Somalia, Nigeria, Egypt, etc are all countries of much larger size and much bigger populations that any effort to eliminate extreme poverty in those nations would require trillions to fix over a couple of years.......2) The US and other wealthy nations arent that wealthyThe US isnt this vast source of wealth where it can dump trillions of dollars down the drain in trying to help every dirt poor country in the world become slightly less broke. The US already owes more money than any other nation in the world, and other nations in Europe arent much better off in terms of their debt either.... A proposal like this that calls for all the wealthiest nations to pour trillions into half of the nations in the world that struggle with extreme poverty would simply drive the wealthy nations that much further into debt, perhaps into outright bankruptcy, because those coutnries dont have that much money to burn on other nations. 3) It probably wouldnt even workIn the past ten years alone, the US has poured hundreds of billions, maybe even a couple trillion, dollars into Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in an effort to build up those countries and also to fight the war on terror...... Despite these TRILLION dollar interventions over the course of over a decade now, Iraq and Afghanistan are still two of the most failed nations in the world, and Pakistan is still towards the bottom of the list as well: http://en.wikipedia.org...Dumping trillions of dollars into a country that only averages a couple billion in GDP each year simply doesnt lead to explosive or even modest improvement over the years like your program suggests it would..... In fact the only reason why Iraq and Afghanistan have jumped a few spots is because other nations have gotten even poorer, not because theyve necessarily improved. If pouring TRILLIONS into Iraq and Afghanistan for 10 years didnt fix the poverty in those countries, then what in the hell makes you think that pouring billions into other countries for 20 years would have a better effect?4) The US and wealthy nations cant just walk around wherever they want and nation build as they please Despite nations like Haiti and Iraq being poor as hell, they still have governments which have sovereignty in trying to fix their nations. Any donation by the US and wealthy countries to fix up a country therefore goes to the governments that are already there trying to fix the problem, and if I know governments of crappy countries like I think I know them, then chances are they are going to completely blow that money on something else. Nations gripped with poverty correlate very well with nations that have super corrupted governments (Nigeria and North Korea for example). If you are going to dump billions into a country, then what you actually are doing is giving it to the governments in those nations and hoping that they dont misuse it, or even use it inefficiently..... And 10 out of 10 times they WILL screw something up and the money wont go where it is supposed to go. 5) A lot of poor countries dont have arable land. Youre entire program focuses on first setting up infrastructure and building farms..... Well thats a problem for countries that are almost entirely desert and dont have many areas to even build farms in the first place.... Libya, Chad, Algeria, Niger, Somalia, and Mali are all countries where only small percentages of land can be farmed at all. Mali is only listed at 5% of percentage of land that can be farmed, and many other countries arent much better offhttp://www.tradingeconomics.com...Your program focuses heavily on farming to build up the country, but in countries that dont have any land that can be farmed, this program is completely useless and doomed to fail. 6) The program operates on a lot of idiotic assumptions\"the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time\"There literally is no evidence suggesting this will happen at all..... This is just wishful thinking. If the only reason a country is growing is because of stupendous foreign aid, then everyone there will believe that they can only improve their country if they have lots of foreign aid coming in, which is the exact opposite of what you claim they will do. In addition to that, corrupted government officials will also look at foreign aid as the only way they can keep get massive sums of money for their country, which could easily cause them to drag their feet or delay efforts to improve the country just so that they can prolong how much money foreign nations keep giving them. ==================================================================================In summary: The program wont work, similar programs havent worked in the past, wealthy nations arent that wealthy, there are way too many poor nations in thw rodl to dump billions or trillions of dollars into, a lot of poor nations dont have that much arable land, and this is a really dumb program to advocate for.......', 'You appear to be halfway insulting me and halfway arguing your case. However, your points are all valid. Therefore, I concede victory to you.', \"1. Too many countries: It can be done one country at a time, over a period of 100 or 200 years. 2. The US and other countries don't have enough money: If done over a long period of time the money needed shouldn't overwhelm the nations doing the giving. 3. The US already tried that: What we did in Iraq and Afghanistan was send soldiers. We didn't hire the Iraqis and Afghans to rebuild their infrastructure. Not as far as I know, anyway. 4. We Have No Right To Do That: So a nation doesn't have a right to help another nation on its feet? 5. Many Poor Countries Don't Have a Lot of Farmland: With today's technology, including fertilizers and stuff like that, I'm sure we could make that land arable. 6. The Program Relies on Idiotic Assumptions: It seems like if they have their own businesses, and if opportunity abounds, the people will indeed learn to support themselves. And we wouldn't simply be giving them aid. We would have them build their own infrastructure, and we'd be paying them. They'd eventually learn to help themselves, even after the US lets go of the strings. Summary: I think the program would work, if done properly.\", \"The United States turns its attention to a poor nation like Haiti. Then.. The United States spends billions of dollars repairing their infrastructure and setting up useful farms. Here's the catch: they hire the locals to do all this work, on the payroll of the US Government. The workers would be paid in either food, money, or both. Farms will provide food for the nation, and the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time. After everyone has food to eat, other professions will be explored, such as office jobs. After twenty years or so the country will be much better off, and then the US can end its program and perhaps do the same thing in another country. I am well aware that this would probably not benefit the United States in any way, but it would be done in the name of eradication of poverty. If all the wealthier nations funded these programs, extreme poverty would be nearly extinct within 100 years. I await a response, from someone who's willing to debate this topic with me.\", '(See explanation in comments before reading.) Your argument in all of its forms is a proof by contradiction. First, I will address the original. I will only present the relevant lines in order to make it more readable: A - It is possible that a maximally great being exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it existed in only some possible worlds, it would not be maximally great, as it would be even greater to exist in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. What definition of great must we use to allow us to assert that it would be \"greater\" to exist in all possible worlds? Throughout the debate, I have proposed two: 1 - \"Powerful; posessing the ability to accomplish.\" 2 - “Of major significance or importance.\" You presented a third: 3 - \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" As you can see, the definition we use is crucial in determining the conclusion of your argument, or whether it even flows. If we use the first definition, your maximally great being is not a god, which was the conclusion of your argument, as indicated at the end of the first round. You did not object to this; you merely stated that my definition was inadequate. It is also quite obvious that if we use the second or third definition, statement B is false, as existing in all possible worlds does not make a being greater under those terms. In rounds 2 and 3, you avoid this by stating that you have provided properties that a maximally great being would have. This is entirely meaningless unless we define how we measure greatness. For example, under definition 3, a maximally great being need not have these qualities; it can be admirable AND useless. In round 5, you indicate that great can simulateously mean all of its definitions. For example, it can mean a combination of the above 3. This simply cannot be, for those definitions can interfere. Again, I propose that under definition 2, I am the greatest being. Under definition 1, obviously an omnipotent being would be maximally great. If I were omnipotent, this would be even greater than either of the other two, and thus an omnipotent me would be the maximally great being. If we prove the existence of a maximally great being using those 2 joint definitions, we have just proved the existence of an omnipotent me! This is why we must stick to one definition of the word per argument and/or prioritize them. You attempt to face my request for a definition of \"great\" for the first time in rounds 3 and 4 by posting a different version of the argument in which you avoid using that word: A - It is possible that a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and necissarily-existing exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it exists in some possible worlds, it exists in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. I will restate this point: \"Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid.\" Here are your objections to the gods I presented, which you list in round 5: \"...Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience.\" If we define \"Horrible\" as, \"Causing fear or dread or terror,\" a being which is omnipotent would certainly cause more fear than a limited being. You suggest that it would not need to be able to create a universe, but how horrible could it be if it were not able to create things which it could terrify and maim? Omniscience would also enhance the horribleness of the being. Thus, both of these qualities are musts for a maximally horrible being. You do make the claim that maximal horribleness contradicts omnipotence, but you do not back this up. Anticipating spectators\\' feelings toward this claim, note that this is only true in the case that maximal horribleness implies that some things are not logically possible, such as saving a kitten from a tree. The fact that the maximally horrible being is unwilling to help a kitten from a tree does not mean that it, in principle could not help a kitten from a tree. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that a being which could help the kitten and instead chooses not to is more horrible than a being which simply could not. \"There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate).\" I can easily conceive of necessarily-existent beings possessing these qualities. There need not exist things which the maximally irritating being can annoy. There also need not exist a being with which the maximally competitive being can compete. It would be within the power of each of these beings under their omnipotence to create things to irritate with which to compete. Similarly, as per your definition of a maximally great being, such a being would be omnibenevolent. There need not exist a field in which this being can do good works; it can create a field within which it can do good works Unless you want to concede that your argument structure is invalid, you must accept the existence of these beings. Fortunately, no one need accept their existence as the argument structure is demonstrably invalid via the use of another god. I conceived of this god in a rather absurd dream last night: the maximally detectable being. The maximally detectable being would have to be omnipotent to ensure circumstances under which it would be detected. The maximally detectable being would have to be omniscient to ensure it has knowledge of all states of the universe with which it manipulates circumstances via its omnipotence to maximize its detectability. The maximally detectable being is necessarily existing. And finally, the maximally detectable being ensures that the minds it creates would be aware of the presence of the maximally detectable being with 100% certainty. Assume your argument structure is valid. It is possible that a maximally detectable being exists. If your argument structure is valid, the maximally detectable being can be proven to exist using that structure. Therefore, the maximally detectable being must exist. If the maximally detectable being exists, you and I would detect it with 100% certainty. Neither you nor I have detected this being, therefore it does not exist. This proves either that one of your premises is false or that your argument structure is invalid. Some minor points from round 5: [1]: I need not give an argument for a claim I did not make. If you read what I wrote, I said nothing of brains. If an entity does not have a mind, it is not logically possible for it to do things which require a mind. You have not shown it to be the case that mindlessness contradicts omnipotence, because all of the things you claim are logically possible without a brain, which I do not deny, DO require a MIND. Again... the non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. [2]: Note that my statement was in response to another claim you made in round 4: \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" The rock is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to do anything today.\" The rock is simply not choosing to do anything as it cannot choose. The non-conscious entity is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to exercise my limitless power.\" It is simply not exercising its limitless power because it does not have the ability to do so. If it had that ability, it would contradict its mindlessness, which you never successfully proved to be impossible. [3]: I did concede the existence of a \"maximally great being.\" However, the existence of an utterly useless thing was not your conclusion. Although I conceded the existence of something with the same name as what you arguing for the existence of, it is not the same thing; I have not conceded the debate.', 'Thank you for finally expressing your position on the use of the word \"great.\" I do find it saddening that you have waited until round 4 to do so, but I hope that my points will become clear now that you have done this. You suggest that the argument proves the definition to which you appealed. This is true if and only if your definition allows your argument to be valid. For example, if I define a maximally great being as a being with the highest tolerance for spicy food, it does not logically follow that its existence in a possible world implies its existence in all possible worlds. Until you define the word \"great,\" it is unclear if your argument follows logically. You then present, again, another form of the argument which does not use the word \"great.\" I should first note that this is not the same argument that you were arguing for the validity of. Reminding the voters to keep this in mind, I shall do the extra work of dismantling it anyway: I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds. This is a possible world under your definition. Under your \"new\" definition of a maximally great being, premise 3 has thus been falsified. Furthermore, in philosophy, validity is determined by truth tables. Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid. I shall now define a few other gods: A maximally horrible being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, and omnimalevolent A maximally irritating being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, regularly intervenes in the universe to play practical jokes on people and confuse them, and has an inexplicable love of Miley Cyrus music. A maximally competitive being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent being and which has only one goal: to undo everything the maximally great being does. If the ontological argument were valid to prove the existence of any being you define, it is also valid to prove the existence of any being I define. Unless you concede the existence of those beings which I have defined, the argument structure is invalid. Fortunately, the existence of all of these things is negated by the falsity of premise 3 under their definitions. In response to extension 2, this is what I was countering when I first said that I conceded the existence of a maximally great being if and only if it allowed for the validity of the argument. Any maximally great being which would fit would not be considered God. If you propose to use the definition of a maximally great being that the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses, I then ask you to define \"excellence\" just as I asked you to define \"greatness,\" and for the same reason. I also bring forth the possible world which is inaccessible via other possible worlds and in which necessary existence is not a property. Thank you for providing a definition of the word \"great\" which allows your being to be omnibenevolent. Unfortunately, if this is what is meant by \"great,\" premise 3 of your argument is false. An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world. Your flaw resides in attempting to combine all definitions of the word \"great.\" This is the nature of the equivocation fallacy. A problem arises when we decide which definition will take priority. For example, if great means \"Powerful. Possessing the ability to accomplish,\" and \"of major significance or importance,\" one of two things is called into question: whether this maximally great being should be considered a god, or the validity of the argument. If the former takes priority, then the same problems I have presented before arise. If the latter takes priority, then I declare that I am greater than God. On the necessity of consciousness, note that I was careful in my wording. I suggested that a disembodied mind may not be logically possible. However, this appears to be distracting you from the main issue. My statement was that a maximally great being need not be conscious, depending on the definition of great. If this being does not have a mind, then it cannot think, reason, etc. However these are things which are logically impossible to do without a mind. There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. Extension 3 is but a reiteration of this point. I have already addressed this. \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" This does not follow. A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to. This does not entail an ability to choose. It is possible that the thing simply cannot choose due to a logical impossibility to do so. Remember that omnipotence is not necessarily useful. In response to your final statements, if the word \"great\" was not required in the beginning, then you should not have used it in your definition. This was a flaw in your own planning. Definitions are best kept specific and exclusive. Your original definition was neither. I will, for the last time, suggest that you present a definition of the word \"great\" so that your original argument can be valid and your maximally great being will retain the status of \"god.\" You may want to present another argument, but this is not relevant to the validity of your original argument, which you were arguing for. Furthermore, based on my past experience, your original argument is the one which will be the easiest to defend due to its vagueness. It is my recommendation that you focus your next round on it instead. I await your decision.', 'Thank you for attempting to clarify this for me. I have indeed understood the argument, and I have spent the past two rounds explaining to you how crucial it is that you define the term \"great.\" Unfortunately, you have still neglected to establish a definition. This is of prime importance in determining either the truth of your premises or the validity of your argument. Please choose a definition for great which can be used to describe God in the way that you desire and also allows your argument to retain its validity. Your other option is to be guilty of an equivocation fallacy. I requested in round 1 that you do this in round 2. I am now asking that you do this in round 4. You have indeed defined a maximally great being... however, you have done so quite poorly. To provide this definition, you have used a word which does not have a certain definition. If we don\\'t know what \"great\" means, how are we supposed to know if a maximally \"great\" being is comparable to God? Again, I provide the example in which \"great\" means “of major significance or importance.\" In this case, I am greater than God, as I am much more important to myself as I do not believe in God. Am I God? Of course not. I implore you; for the sake of the validity of your argument, provide a definition for the word \"great.\" It\\'s quite impossible for me to continue until you provide me with a sufficient definition. I have already shown your definition of a maximally great being to be faulty under my definition of \"great,\" and you have not contested it under this definition. Extend all arguments until pro provides a valid definition. As for your refutation of my claims about existence... I should warn you not to become too distracted with this. This was after all only a suggestion as to what this maximally great being could be; it is not necessary for me to provide this in order to show your claim for the existence of God to be false. All the same, as I have about 6000 characters left, I shall defend it. At no point did I suggest that existence is a property. I am well aware of the proof of which you speak; however, I suggested existence as an entity, not a property. Existence may not be a predicate, but it certainly can be a subject. Furthermore, in the case of existence itself, a consciousness may not be logically possible as there would be no physical thing to be responsible for this consciousness. Thus, its omnipotence remains intact. You accuse me of imporperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence.', '“Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true.” Unfortunately, your conclusion was not “There is a maximally great being,” but “There is a God,” which you indicate in the final line of the first round. There is indeed a maximally great being; you have no disagreement from me on that count. My disagreement is in that this maximally great being is God or even A god. This statement also encompasses the claim you make in your final paragraph of round 2. “Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\"” Unfortunately, without establishing a definition of the word “great,” you are potentially guilty of an equivocation fallacy. Allow me to explain: If we take the word “great” to mean “of major significance or importance,” then your maximally great being is not omnipotent, omniscience, or omnibenevolent. In fact, I declare that a maximally great being would instead be myself. I am much more important to me than an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being, because I do not believe such a being exists. Therefore, I can think of a “greater” being than the greatest conceivable being. It is clear you do not accept the definition of “great” to be “Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish.” I suggest you attempt to establish an alternative definition in the next round to avoid the aforementioned fallacy. You suggest that “[your] definition” is superior at the end of the paragraph I have just referenced. I ask: did you mean the definition of a maximally great being? If this is the case, then I will simply state that your definition can be less restrictive and accomplish the same goal, and is thus, inferior. Indeed, one component is potentially contradictory (provided that you do not sufficiently defend it), which, if shown to be the case, would entirely nullify the usefulness of your definition. Did you mean the definition of “great,” and “greatness”? If this is the case, then I again suggest you attempt to establish these definitions in the next round. I will extend my argument against omniscience as your rebuttal is based upon a disagreement on the meaning of the word “great.” Until you establish an alternative definition, the argument stands. “An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being.” A being need not be benevolent to establish a moral law, should one exist. In fact, an omnipotent, omnimalevolent being would have to establish a moral law in order to defy it. You claim that to be good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Indeed, we may prefer a being which is all-good, but if the definition of “greatness” is not established to have a meaning that encompasses morality, this claim holds no weight. Therefore, I again claim that a neutral being would be greater than either as it would have no restriction upon its actions. “Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things.” Indeed, existence is responsible for all logically possible things. If existence did not itself exist, then there would not exist anything, including the concepts of those things which are logically possible. By itself existing, existence has put into place all that exists, and an alteration in existence itself could put into existence anything which could possibly exist. “But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence.” Again, this disagreement takes place based on your disagreement with my definition of “great.” I will take this opportunity to put further weight on the irrelevance of omniscience until an alternative definition is given.', 'As a disclaimer, I agree that the ontological argument is a sound argument for a maximally great being. What I will be showing to be faulty is your definition of a maximally great being, and therefore your suggestion that this maximally great being is God. This will become clear in a moment. For the purpose of this argument, I put forth the following as suggestions for definitions of “great” and “greatness”: Great – Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish. Greatness – A measure of a thing’s ability to accomplish. For this round, I will be operating under these definitions. If you do not agree with these or wish to put forth alternative definitions, please do so in the next round. It is your assertion that a maximally great being would be omniscient. I claim that omniscience is irrelevant to a being’s greatness. Indeed, it is my claim that consciousness is not a quality required of a maximally great being. A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be. Our human perception suggests that having a mind makes things “better,” but this does not make something more able to accomplish. If a maximally great being were instead a pre-planned set of events dependent upon circumstances, it would not change that being’s ability to set those events into motion. It is also your assertion that a maximally great being would be omnibenevolent. Even if we establish that such a being had a consciousness, it is not required that it do good works. Again, certainly we humans would prefer that it were benevolent. However, an omnibenevolent being is in fact limited in that it cannot perform evil tasks. I propose that a neutral being is in fact greater than either an omnibenevolent or omnimalevolent being as it can freely perform either good or evil tasks, if we were to even establish that such things existed. What we are left with is a being which is omnipotent (that is, it can accomplish anything), and exists in every logically possible world. Existence itself is omnipotent (If it exists in a possible world, then it has been accomplished under the power of existence itself. Not even God is claimed to be able to make logically incoherent things exist.) and must exist in every logically possible world, as for it to be otherwise is a contradiction. Existence itself is a maximally great being. If you wish to worship a non-conscious entity which would as soon destroy you as create you, you are free to do so. However, it is my contention that this is no God at all, but merely a feature of reality.', 'This is a terrible parody. The reason why a MGB under the definition I presented applies to all possible worlds is because a property of a MGB as defined is that the explanation for its existence, if it actually exists, is necessary rather than contingent existence. If you define a MGB as one that is most \"tolerable\" of spicy food then the premises would not follow from this definition. So by using this example, which is fallacious, and comparing it to the definition I gave, which does lead into the conclusion, you have proven that the definition to which I have appealed is sound. Necessary existence is existence in every logically possible world. Necessity is a property, existence is not. Then, FINALLY, you attempt to deny a premise of the actual argument. The arguments without the word \"great\" in them are NOT different arguments. They are the same exact arguments I gave in the first post. What you have not refuted is that the word \"great\" is meaningless since the argument functions by replacing it with \"God\" and O^3NE the same exact way. Thus, definitions like the ones you gave do not matter when determining the soundess of the argument. \"I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds\" This shows your ignorance of the modal realm. In no possible world can necessity not be a property. This is true because anything that exists has an explanation of its existence. These explanations are of two sorts: (1) they exist by a necessity of their own nature or (2) they exist by an external cause (contingency). The property of necessity exists in every possible world. These are the two explanations of being. I will address your parodies by addressing the first. My objections will apply to all of them: On Maximal Horribleness: This is bad. \"Maximally Horrible Being\" just is to say that there exists a being that is omnimalevolent (this is what it means to be maximally horrible). But, Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience. Thus, it is impossible for this being to have these properties as well as necessity since \"Maximal Horribleness\" only entails one of the properties you described: omnimalevolence. On the contrary, a MGB as defined as a \"being than which none greater can be conceived (I stated this in round two)\" necessarily must have omnipotence etc. since if it did not, one could conceive of a greater being. But a \"maximally horrible being\" does not have the same application since I can conceive of a Maximally Horrible Being not being omnipotent; that is, I can conceive of a being that is about to inflict horror, but this does not mean that it must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible (omnipotence). In order to be a Maximally Horrible Being it does not need to be able to create the universe for example. So the argument fails because it actually contradicts omnipotence. Let me just say a word about irritating and competitive: these things are illogical. There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate). This, it is CONTINGENT on the existence of other things. Hence not necessary. Hence not applicable. So you have not given a successful parody. You then ask to defined Maximal Excellence in the Stanford definition. Ironically, they did that for you, once again. Maximal excellence is an entity which possesses: \"omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.\" What makes it MG is that it is necessary. \"An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world.\" But it could not be restricted to one possible world. It is a contradiction to say a necessary being (exists in all possible worlds) is \"restricted to one possible world.\" \"There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact.\" This is hopelessly fallacious. You claim that minds cannot exist without brains. You have made an assertion, you have not given an argument. So I will attempt to anticipate since this is my last chance: all arguments for substance materialism are that we know of no minds that do not depend on the brain. Notice how this is specific to our experience and to homo sapiens. There are no logical inferences that allow one to say that because humans don\\'t have embodied minds, that therefore they are impossible. You have to show that the concept is like a round square, and clearly it is not. Additionally, you are ONCE AGAIN, equivocating on omnipotence: Your claim is that an omnipotent being exists but it cannot be called God since it is not conscious. This is a contradiction. By definition omnipotence is a being\\'s ability to do all things that are logically possible. But we know that consciousness is logically possible. Which means your being is not omnipotent since it does not have consciousness. Which means omnipotence is reliant on consciousness. An unconscious all powerful things cannot have consciousness hence not making it all powerful. You lose here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" This is just ABSURD. You beg the question here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" A rock cannot choose! Thus my argument still stands: an omnipotent being must be conscious since by definition it must be able to choose but choice is only possible with consciousness. REASONS TO VOTE FOR ME: 1.Definitions DO NOT matter in terms of taking one word out of MGB an defining it. Remember that I defined such a being as being omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent in every possible world AND as \"a being than which none greater can be conceived.\" My opponent has tried to refute it by saying \"great\" can mean different things. This does not matter since the argument proves the definition I gave as a collective thing: MGB. Moreover, the word \"great\" is not needed in the argument: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists This is the same exact argument as I originally offered. It proves the existence of the same exact being. The argument stands. 2.I proved that the use of individual definitions, which is what he is doing, is fallacious. He has yet to respond to this: \"A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics.\" 3.My opponent CONCEDED that a MGB exists. He just said it is not \"conscious,\" but that it is omnipotent. This is the reason you should vote for me: he concedes an omnipotent being exists, but an omnipotent being MUST BE CONCIOUSS because if it is not then that necessarily means it cannot do something that can logically be done: perceive, think, choose etc. So my opponent tacitly concedes the entire debate.', 'I am sorry. You are not answering the argument. The argument does not rely on the individual definition of its parts. The definition of a MGB as defined by Alvin Plantinga, who developed this argument, is as was defined by me in round one. You are quibbling about nothing Extension One: Everyone can extend the argument I made in the first rebuttal about how his definitions game was irrelevant. The argument does not rely on the definition of particular words. Rather, the argument proves the definition to which I appealed. I demonstrated this in the following way, an argument to which he did not respond: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists See, using \"MGB\" is not needed; its just three words used to defined a being with the properties mentioned above. The argument functions the same and proves that a being with O^3NE exists. The conclusion follows unless he attacks one of the premises, which he has yet to do. Extension Two: I also proved the above argument by showing that using specifically \"MGB\" is necessary if I simply replace it with \"GOD.\" God is defined as an omnipotent, all knowing all good and necessary being. Now, working under this definition, the argument still works into the conclusion, PROVING THAT INDIVIDUAL DEFINITIONS ARE IRRELEVANT: 1. It is possible that God (as defined) exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ....The rest follows. Moreover, the use of individual definitions, I argued, is misleading. There are dozens of definitions of the word \"great.\" None of the encompass the philosophy of religion since, a common dictionary is not a good reference when having discussions like these. First I will offer a collective definition of a MGB from an authority (since I seem to be inadequate) and then use individual definitions to do the exact same ridiculous things hes doing to undermine his positions: From Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"The \"victorious\" modal ontological argument of Plantinga (1974) goes roughly as follows: Say that an entity possesses \"maximal excellence\" if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Say, further, that an entity possesses \"maximal greatness\" if and only if it possesses maximal excellence in every possible world—that is, if and only if it is necessarily existent and necessarily maximally excellent.\" It matters not individual definitions, but the collective definition since no matter what you call it, the argument proves that an All knowing, all good, all powerful and necessary being exists. Call it a MGB or not. Call it a sandwich (this would be equivocating but if you define \"sandwich\" as having these properties, then the argument STILL works and it proves a God in whom you do not believe) But now I will employ reductio ad absurdum to show how your use of definitions is pointless. OMNIBENEVOLENCE: A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics. You make an unwarranted assertion and finally attack the idea of being all-knowing as \"may not be logically possible.\" That\\'s nice, can you provide an argument? There is no explicit logical incoherence of an unembodied mind; there is therefore a possible world in which these things could exist. They are metaphysically possible. I do not even need to defend dualism-interactionism because you make a devastating concession. Namely, you concede that a MGB exists, but it only has the property of omnipotence. Extension 3: This is devastating. You have not responded to the fact that you are equivocating. Omnipotence means, for the third time, the ability to do all things that are logically possible. If this being is omnipotent and does not have the property of consciousness, and by extension, the ability to think, feel, act in purpose etc., then there are logically possible things it cannot do. Hence, not omnipotent. But you conceded it was omnipotent. Therefore, it follows necessarily that it does have a mind not bound by physicality. You object: You accuse me of improperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence. This is demonstrably fallacious: Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose. Sure God does not need to do something, but in order for Him to be omnipotent, He must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible. If something cannot think, reason, etc. the fact that it does not do this is irrelevant insofar as it cannot do these things, hence it not being omnipotent. Again, equivocation. For the sake of everybody else, I cannot stress how irrelevant his points are to the truth of the argument. You may disagree with the argument, but we can all agree, through the laws of logic and deduction, that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. And he has yet to respond to a single premise. Once again, his entire argument rests on the word \"great,\" having one of many definitions. I will repost: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists Notice here how \"great\" or MGB is nowhere in the argument. Why? Because it is NOT needed, \"great\" and \"MGB\" are not necessary for the argument.', 'I think you are not understanding the argument: I claimed that the definition, on which the Ontological argument relies, of a Maximally Great Being is a being who has the properties of omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, and existence in every possible world. Now, based on that definition of a MGB, the argument in terms of the syllogism proves that such a being exists. 1. It is possible that a MGB exists (MGB is the definition I gave) If this premise is true, then the rest follows. The argument proves the definition I gave, so in order for you to deny the existence of such a being, you have got to refute one of the premises. Insofar as you have yet to refute any of them, the conclusion follows with necessity. Your use of definitions is dubious and irrelevant. Even if I grant that your definitions of individual words is applicable, all I have to do is change the phrase \"MGB\" to God. Then the argument still follows so the semantics game is irrelevant: God is the greatest conceivable being. As the greatest conceivable being He would be omnipotent, omniscient and necessary in every possible world. 1. It is possible that God exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ... and the rest follows. So your quibbling about the semantics of the individual words of MGB is irrelevant since the conclusion still follows. The entire argument can be extended because the argument, regardless of your definitions, proves that a being that I HAVE DEFINED exists. So in order to win, you have got to reject a specific premise otherwise there is an indictment to which you may have to be subjected: irrationality. The conclusion follows with necessity if the premises are true, and you have yet to refute one of them. is sorry, you are incorrect. The conclusion of the syllogism, which is the argument, is \"Therefore, a MGB (as in, a being that is all powerful, all knowing, all good in every possible world) exists.\" Like I said, MGB in the syllogism is the same as saying \"It is possible that an all knowing, all good, all powerful, and necessary being exists in every possible world.\" MGB is simply to name a being who has all of those properties. I am not equivocating since I established a definition of an entire concept: maximal greatness. The argument functions under the definition I gave in argument one which you have yet to respond. You cannot simply define a word within a concept. The concept is defined as a whole. Remember, the argument functions independent of individual definitions, the argument (as in the syllogism) proves the MGB that I defined, so your quibbling is irrelevant. My argument is NOT based on a disagreement of the definitions you offered. I am sure that generically, that is what those words mean. But I have defined the concept of a maximally great being as a being than which no greater being can be conceived; the greatest conceivable being. The argument, which you have yet to respond, proves THIS definition, which means your arguments are irrelevant. I cannot stress this enough because the argument functions on the definition I provided. This is common knowledge if you look up the literature on the modal ontological argument. My argument from omniscience goes unrefuted. The fact is you CONCEDED omnipotence as a property of a MGB. You contradict yourself completely by saying that a MGB does not have the properties of knowledge, reason, all-knowingness etc. because that means there are things which a MGB cannot do/experience which contradicts omnipotence. Implication: you are equivocating in terms of omnipotence since this means to have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible, which includes being all-knowing. On omnibenvolence: look, even if such a being does not have to be benevolent, this is absolutely irrelevant. The reason is because the argument proves that a being with this property actually exists. Even if it does not have to have this property, so what? The argument proves that it does with the conclusion. \"Therefore, a MGB (as I have defined it) exists.\" On existence: it is paradoxical that you should make this argument. The obsolete version of the Ontological Argument developed by Anselm of Cantebury in 1033 A.D. made the same mistake by considering existence to be a property. Immanuel Kant did away with this argument by proving that existence is not a predicate or a property. This is absurd. Look it up, this has been sufficiently refuted. Moreover, your claim that existence alone is omnipotent is false and is equivocation. Omnipotent, again, means the ability to do that which is logically possible. But an abstract concept that you offer does not have the ability to think, experience personhood, etc. So you are not using the word properly. I think it is clear that the argument stands. To get away from the definition debate, here is why I win: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists You have already conceded that the logic with which the argument functions is sound. So the conclusion follows from the premises and I have successfully circumvented your use of individual definitions to prove that a being, as I have defined it, actually exists. Hence, the Ontological Argument is sound As Bertrand Russell remarked \"Great God in boots! The Ontological Argument is sound!\"', 'Thank you for the debate. Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true. Notice how the definition I offered of a MGB is not part of the argument in terms of the deductive syllogism. This is because the syllogism, if the premises are true, prove the definition of a MGB to which I appealed. That is, if the argument is true then the definition of a MGB I offered is exemplified in a being that actually exists. If you accept that \"it is possible that a MGB exists\" as in MGB that I defined, then everything follows. So you have not shown how my definition is incoherent. But, naturally, your arguments are vacuous. Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\" As I said, taken together, a MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be conceived.\" If you can think of a greater being, then that would be the MGB. Thus, if the properties of this being to which I have appealed are properties that a MGB should have as a being than which none greater can be conceived, then it follows that my definition is superior. Omniscience: Your argument is demonstrably fallacious. You say: \"A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be.\" This is false. You already concede that a MGB would have omnipotence. But if a MGB has omnipotence, then it would have to have consciousness. For if it could not experience the ability to perceive and reason and think, then it not only is not a MGB but it is also not omnipotent because there is something that is logically possible that it cannot do; namely, the property of having consciousness. Moreover, if it does not have the ability to be all-knowing then it is not truly a MGB since we can plausibly conceive of a being that is greater; one who does have the property of maximal intelligence and knowledge. So your claim that a MGB is fallacious because by definition, the most perfect conceivable being would have the properties of knowing and reason and consciousness. These things are better to have than not to have, otherwise it is blind about without purpose. An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being. By the very nature of maximal greatness, the nature of such a being would entail the property of being all-good, for to be all good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things. But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence. Your view renders this abstraction as a thing that cannot do a multiplicity of things that we would consider a MGB to be able to do. Thus, you completely undermine the definition of omnipotence because your view means there are plausibly things that cannot be done by this being. It is important to note, however, that I win even if everything above is false. You have simply pointed out that a MGB does not have to have certain properties. But you did not show that having those properties is logically incoherent. Since you did not prove that it is logically incoherent, then that means the argument\\'s conclusion follows and therefore a MGB under my definition exists. Since the argument is based on the definition I gave, and the definition I gave is logically possible, then the conclusion is inescapable based on the laws of deduction. Since it is possible that a MGB as defined by me in post 1 is possibly exemplified in a world, then it follows that such a being does exist, even if you are correct and a MGB does not have to have those properties. My argument shows that it does. By the way, references include Alvin Plantinga who developed this modal form.', 'Framework: In order to show that the Ontological Argument is not sound, the CON must show that one of the premises of the argument is untrue. If all of the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion follows with necessity as it is a deductive argument. Observation One: \\'Possible Worlds\\' are descriptions of reality. They are ways the world could have been but is not actually. For example, fairies do not actually exist, but there is some possible world in which fairies do exist. If something is possible, then it exists in some possible world. Observation Two: A Maximally Great Being (MGB) is a being that is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent and that exists in every logically possible world (necessary existence). Since an MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be concieved,\" it must have the property of necessity since to exist in only some possible worlds would not be maximally great, that is, one can conceive of a greater being; namely one that exists in every world. Observation Three: To say something is possible, that is, something that is logically coherent, is the same as saying that there is some possible world in which this thing does exist. To say that a thing exists in every possible world is to say that that thing exists in the actual world, since out world is a possible world. To say that something, of which the property of necessity is exemplified, exists in some possible world, is the same as saying that it exists in every possible world because to necessarily exist means to exist in every possible world. The Argument: Premise (1): It is possible that a MGB exists Premise (2): If it is possible that a MGB exists, then a MGB exists in some possible world Premise (3): If a MGB exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world Premise (4): If a MGB exists in every possible world, it exists in the actual world Premise (5): If a MGB exists in the actual world, then a MGB exists Conclusion (6): Therefore, a MGB exists in the actual world Conclusion (7): Therefore, a MGB exists Premises 2-7 are uncontroversial. The modal logic with which the argument functions is very well established and both atheistic and theistic philosophers would agree. Thus, the whole argument rests on whether or not the existence of a MGB is possible. Justification for Premise 1: There are two types of possibilities: Metaphysical Possibility and Epistemic Possibility. The former represents things that are actually possible because their properties are not logically incoherent, or there are no logical contradictions. For example, a round square is metaphysically impossible because it is logically incoherent. Having a coin in your pocket is metaphysically possible since there is no logical incoherence about that event. Epistemic possibility is \"for all we know, X is true.\" It is the same as being presented with a difficult math equation and seeing the solution. For all you know it may be true or false. An example would be the coin: For all I know you could have a coin in your pocket. Metaphysical possibility deals with actual possibility, those things which could actually exist because their properties are not logically incoherent. Therefore, if something is logically coherent, then it is metaphysically possible. So, is the concept of a MGB coherent? Well, there seems to be no contradiction within the definition I gave; no incoherence. It seems perfectly plausible that the properties within the definition are logically consistent. Thus, if the definition on which the argument relies is coherent, then it follows that Premise 1 is true and therefore the argument is true. In order for the CON to disprove 1, the concept of a MGB needs to be proven incoherent; like a round square. No such contradiction seems to be evident. Thus, if you think God\\'s existence is even possible, then it follows that God exists. And we therefore have a priori proof for the existence of a MGB, AKA God.', 'Thanks for your attemopt and yeah you have a good point but i can deal with. I thought of this idea because of the nature of the debate or vote. When you have a debate with someone and there is no time limit for the voting period, it does not make sense because in that case there will not be a clear winner and and you will have to check all the time and at the end, you just give up. your point about the number limit of voters, i just believe if we can just say that the debate will be decided by the forst 20 or 30 numbers of voters or even ten but the problem with that sometimes is if you dont have that number of people voting,you can then decide on who has most people in the voting period. when you say that you have for instance 10 liberal coming first and vote and conservative sometimes coming late, the decision will not be fair. I believe that people should not vote based on their own feelings or opinions. the vote should be based on the arguments made by the debaters and who has better ones. that is how i vote and i believe that is how a debate should be decided. If it is already possible to forfeit a round because somebody could not make it in a frame of time, why not limit the voting period too or numbers of voters. this can be decided by the debaters before starting a debate. You should also know that no all people will vote for each debate. people usually read debate they are interested in and then vote. so even if there is no time limit, lots of people still might not vote. Thanks and have a nice day', 'I know most people here including myself are here to learn and dont really mind losing or winning a debate. Instead I wanna learn from others. I just think that during the voting period, we should have a limited numbers of voters or days to decide the winner and the loser. This will make the whole debating thing exciting... because right now it is not limited and you must keep checking all the time to know if there is any change. Thanks', \"I will make an attempt to win this although it is set up extremely lopsided, towards the Pro. Because the website updates the statistics on your w/l record, it is not necessary for them to stop the voting at a certain time, so as to tally the results. By limiting the number of voters, you limit the selection of voters, so, if 10 liberals get to a conservative topic before the conservatives, and there are only 10 votes allowed, it would be unfair to the conservative debater. Also, because there are so few members on the site, and so few actively voting, by limiting the voting time, you limit the number of votes, which I have already stated is not a good thing, some people aren't on here 24/7 but may still want to vote, but if the voting period is up before they get to the topic they can't.\", \"Since you have mainly based your argument on the fact that you want to see who wins or loses, I will go over that first. First of all, the w/l record is constantly updated, so you don't have to go back and look to see if you won or lost constantly, secondly it is not that hard to go to your profile, and look through each of your debates and look at the two numbers above the names. If you are willing to put forth the effort to debate a topic, you should be able to click a few times and read some numbers. You also haven't taken into consideration all the people who cannot be on the website everyday, and will miss out on voting, and each debate needs as many votes as possible, to keep any biases from affecting it, it is just like when the media takes a poll, if they don't poll a wide variety of people, they often end up wrong, for example, the Chicago Tribune stating that Dewey beat Truman in the presidential election... if we only allow a small amount of voters, we may end up with biased votes, especially in very controversial topic such as religion. Also, since the site is still growing, by limiting the time for which a debate can be voted on, we disallow future members from voting on certain topics, and as I have stated, you need a wide variety, and large amount of voters to be accurate. I believe that it is more important for the debate voting to be accurate, than for the debaters to be able to check the win or loss easily, and that there are better options for checking the win loss, if it is in fact really necessary.\", 'Wouldn\"t you feel better about yourself if you knew you could help thousands of people? I hope so. Now there\"s cloning going on. I know some of you guys are thinking \"Like in books and movies?!\" My answer to that is no. You know what cloning is. And if you don\"t cloning is when a cell, cell product, or organism is genetically identical to the unit or individual from which it was derived. Cloning is important because if you\"re in a accident and you lose one of your limbs or organs or a body part, with therapeutic cloning you may be able to get it back. If you\"re a victim of heart attack, cloning can help by cloning healthy heart cells and putting it in damaged areas of the heart. Infertile couples can now have kids with cloning. Cloning can help people with disabilities. I strongly believe that cloning should not be banned.', 'This is our last time to argue. I hope you think that cloning is good now. There aren\"t many cons on cloning. All you can really do with the cons are write more details about them in depth. But for pros there are many. I will happily list some of them.\" Cloning might produce a greater understanding of the cause of miscarriages, which might lead to a treatment to prevent spontaneous abortions. This would help women who can\\'t bring a fetus to term. It might lead to an understanding of the way a morula (mass of cells developed from a blastula) attaches itself to the uterine wall. This might generate new and successful contraceptives.\" I got that quote from \"The Cloning Debate: Pro Views.\" ThinkQuest. Oracle Foundation, n.d. Web. 10 Mar. 2014.\" What this quote says is that cloning can help woman who can\"t produce a child. Here is another quote. \"Easy replacement of internal organs and tissues for patients in need of transplants instead of waiting for suitable organ donors, alive or dead. Since the transplanted organ contains most of the recipient\"s genes, there is a lesser chance for rejection as well. Cloning can be a solution to the infertility issue among couples. Theoretically speaking, parents can choose the desirable qualities in their genes to be passed on to their children. Genetic research can immensely benefit from cloning especially in combating the wide range of genetic diseases.\" This information was from \"Surfcrs. \"Organ Cloning.\" Organ Cloning RSS. Organ Cloning, 19 Jan. 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2014.\" This quote has 3 pros. 1.There is easy replacement of organs. 2.Cloning is a solution to infertile couples. 3. Research with cloning can help understand diseases. I keep saying this in my paragraphs but cloning can help people with disabilities or people with diseases. If someone in your family had cancer and they thought that with cloning they might discover a cure. Wouldn\\'t\"t you be all for it? Cloning is such a useful thing for so many people. I still stand for Pro on cloning. Thank you for reading this.', 'Cloning is only bad if you make it bad. You see, Cloning can help million and thousands of people. People with disabilities can be helped. I myself do not agree with making a race of perfect individuals. I feel like that is wrong. You are only looking at the negatives of cloning. I only wrote negatives in that paragraph to show others what the negatives can be. So if they later on they found out, they wouldn\\'t\"t blame me for not telling them in my paragraph. If people use cloning in such a way, I will strongly disagree with their wrong-doings. Some woman don\"t feel like cloning is good because they need to donate one egg cell. The thing is, Us women have a lot of egg cells to spare. Will it really hurt us if we donate one egg cell? And for your comment of \"They think that when using an unfertilized egg for any type of cloning you are killing a possible human, a possible child. \" Wouldn\\'t\"t you think it better for a person to not have lived in the first place, or be killed later on? what if you got an a accident and lost the power to move your leg? And the doctors say \" There is a possibility to gain power of your foot once more. But you would need therapeutic cloning.\" Would your answer be no? Would you really believe so strongly that cloning is that bad that you wouldn\\'t\"t try to save yourself in any way?', 'The risks/cons for cloning are that there is a possibility of faster aging. This is because you are using an older cell to clone. Another risk is that it may reduce the overall value of human life. If you didn\"t like your first child, you can try to make the perfect child with cloning. Another con is that there is a reduced sense of individuality. Cloning makes us seem all the same. I got this information from \"Pros and Cons of Human Cloning.\" HealthRF. Health Research Funding.Org, 6 Dec. 2013. Web. 25 Feb. 2014.\" I posted benefits of cloning in my introduction. I got that information from \"Smith, Simon. \"The Benefits of Human Cloning.\" The Benefits of Human Cloning. Human Cloning Foundation, 26 Feb. 1998. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.\" Ethical issues with cloning are that \"religious organizations. They all strongly oppose cloning as according to the religious belief life begins at conception and that life cannot be created artificially but from the unity of a man and female. At the same time, the church together with the other religious organizations argue against therapeutic cloning as well because, as mentioned above, they are guided by the idea that life starts at the conception and once the embryo exists it must be treated as a person, and thus destroying embryos and using them only for the purpose of research is not consistent with the religious view on the issue.\" That was a quote from \"Cloning- Ethical Issues.\" Ethical Issues Of Cloning. Bioarts.Com. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.\" People think that life begins at the stage of an egg cell. Because of this , they think that by using an egg cell that we are killing a human being.', 'There aren\"t many cons to cloning? How about premature death, high rate of miscarriage, moral issues, very low success rate, and loss of individuality? It seems to me that there are quite a few. I can\"t see how you think cloning is a solution for infertile couples. The only couples that would be able to afford it would be the rich and famous. Even if a couple did find enough money, the success rate is simply not high enough to guarantee they leave with a child. \"For a recent paper on cloning in Science, Peter Mombaerts Peter Mombaerts , a scientist at Rockefeller University in New York City who clones mice, ran through 4,000 mouse oocytes\"he estimates that might be $2,000 worth of mice. Doing the same work in humans, he estimates, could cost $2 million. Scientists will almost certainly use fewer eggs if therapeutic cloning is used on people. But even if it required a mere 100 eggs, taken from ten donors, the cost of simply paying the donors could easily reach $50,000. On top of that, there would be medical costs involved in procuring the egg. Mombaerts believes it could cost more than $1,000 per egg when all is said and done. That means costs to treat one patient could conceivably soar above $100,000.\" This is according to \"Cloning\\'s High Cost.\" Forbes. Forbes Magazine. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. How many average American citizens do you think actually have the money to pay for something like that? The median income was $51,017 a year, says Hargreaves, Steve. \"Poverty Rate 15%, Median Income $51,017.\" CNNMoney. Cable News Network, 17 Sept. 2013. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. That is barely over half the cost of therapeutic cloning. The way I see it, cloning is highly impractical. Seeing as the cost is high, and the success rate low, very few can afford it. Along with reducing the value of life, cloning shortens the lifespan of the cloned organism. On top of all that, by continuing with cloning we are one step closer to a dystopian-like society where non-clones are frowned upon, and individuality is a crime. I believe cloning will do more harm than good, and this is why I have, and always will, support the con side.', \"In my opinion, the cons of cloning outweigh the pros. So many things can go wrong, and so many eggs are needed to produce a clone, that you have to ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Personally, I would not want therapeutic cloning. I wouldn't want a woman to have to give up her eggs for my needs. Donating eggs for cloning of any type, therapeutic or not, could turn into a negative thing. Women, similar to being used for prostitution, could be forced to sell their eggs for money. There could be a black market for human egg cells. Would you really feel comfortable using a unwillingly given egg? If cloning was done with, this would never have a need to happen. Along with selling human egg cells, the percentage of miscarriages is undeniably high. 90% of all animal cloning pregnancies result in miscarriage. Most of these miscarriages happen later on in the pregnancy, according to The British Fertility Society. To me, never having a baby at all is better than conceiving one, and losing it. Besides, there are hundreds of thousands of children available for adoption in the U.S. alone.\", 'If you think cloning should be legal, then why are you contradicting yourself? You are saying that most think it is immoral, and that it goes against religious beliefs. This doesn\"t sound like a \"pro\" side argument to me. Since I am strongly believe that cloning is wrong, a huge issue that I have with it is that it could minimize the value of human life, and we wouldn\\'t be individuals. Human life could be looked upon as something you can perfectly create, and that if your child doesn\"t satisfy your needs, you can go out and get another one made, tailored to your specific wants. Also, a caste-like system could re-emerge, putting perfect clones on the top. They would be the \"genetically perfected\". Smart, and attractive. They would also most likely be rich, since cloning is highly expensive and time consuming. How does that sound to you? A race of beautiful, genius people that are treated better than the average. I can tell you one thing, you wouldn\"t like it at all. Naturally made humans may be treated differently than the clones. They are average. You wouldn\"t be considered smart, or pretty unless you were a clone. This is one of the possible negative consequences of cloning. Ethics are highly controversial in the case of cloning. Many thing is is wrong for scientists to \"play God\". Most traditional Christians refer to an embryo as a human being that has a soul. They think it is immoral for scientists to clone to create or destroy embryos, even in the case of research. Around 78.4 percent of America is Christian, according to \"Summary of Key Findings.\" Statistics on Religion in America Report. Web. 03 Mar. 2014. If cloning was legal, nearly 78.4 percent of the U.S.A. would disagree with it. They think that when using an unfertilized egg for any type of cloning you are killing a possible human, a possible child. This doesn\"t seem at all moral, to me.', 'Wouldn\"t you feel bad about wasting the possibility of life with an unsuccessful cloning experiment? With the use of embryonic cells, we\\'ve been successfully cloning mammals since the mid-1980\\'s, but the possibility of actually creating a clone goes from 0.1% to 3%. This means that for every 1000 attempts, 1 to 30 clones are produced. That is up to 70 eggs wasted. With reproductive cloning, those eggs could have possibly been babies. Do you feel comfortable allowing scientists to take away the possibility of life from an egg? I should hope not. In addition, cloning could take away a sense of individuality, since a clone is the genetically identical twin to the person who provided the genetic material, no matter the age of either person. In my opinion, cloning should not be allowed because it strips a human of individuality, and has a very low success rate.', \"I completely agree, IN A COURT OF LAW, the jury is suppossed to be an unbiased judge of a case. This is why random people are selected to for the jury. But in survivor you have played the whole game with the people that are then voting on your fate. FOr them to be impartial is impossible, and wy would you want them to be. Getting to the end and having the jury want to vote for you is one of the most challenging things in the game of survivor, making it tougher than almost any other reality TV show. So, if the jury deemed that they didn't want Russel to win, then he shouldnt have won.\", \"I am not going to deny the Russell Hantz played a good game of Survivor, in fact, it most probably the most manipulative game that the series has ever seen. I also won't argue the point the Russell Hantz 'outwitted and outlasted' his opponents, as this is clearly evident by the fact that he made it to the final three against a huge numbers disadvantage. However the main reason why Russell shouldn't have won Survivor is that he didn't. While this statement may, at first glance, appear to be tautological allow me to explain: There are ultimately two components involved in winning the game of Survivor. The first is to make it to the final three (or two), where the jury votes for the winner, and the second is to be able to win Jury votes once you are there. This aspect of Survivor is what makes it such an intriguing show. The winner is not necessarily the person who has played the best game from an outlasting point of view, but the person who the jury deems is the most deserving recipient of the title of Sole Survivor. The way in which Russell lied, backstabbed sabotaged and manipulated his way into the final 3 fulfilled the first requirement, but made the members of the jury so resentful towards him, that there was no way they would ever vote for him. Ultimately it comes down to the judgement and very often emotions, of these 9 people, and if they do not vote for you, it clearly illustrates that, out of the 3 members remaining, you are not who they believe should win and making the jury believe you should win is what Survivor, in essence, boils down to.Sure he may have found the hidden immunity idols .They weren't really that well hidden, and anyone with the time could have found them. Plus you must not forget that this is a TV show that can be influenced by the producers to enhance ratings. His sabotage of his own tribes campsite at the start of the game illustrates just how conniving he really was, and he certainly won't be the last to lose at the end in this way.\", 'Bring It OnI would like to point out that since Pro is arguing against the status quo, burden of proof is on them.', \"1. Initially, your argument that Russell lost because of the jury's decision makes some sense. However, we need to consider what a jury is. A jury is supposed to be an unbiased group of people making a decision about another person's fate. The jury should have objectively made a decision as to who played the best game of Survivor. Instead, the jury allowed their personal vendettas against Russell, as he caused many of them to leave the show to come into play. The jury was, thus, bitter, and not awarding based on gameplay. If it did look only at who played the best game, it would have chosen Russell over Natalie (and Mick Trimming, who came in third place). Russell led the alliance back from the 8-4 deficit. Natalie and Mick did not have to do any of the strategizing, instead riding Russell's coattails to the end. They did none of the necessary work, but reaped all of the benefits of Russell's strategy. How is that fair? Also, Russell won more challenges (5) than either Natalie or Mick, both of whom won 3. To sum it up, the point of a jury is to be objective and unbiased, which it was not by voting for Natalie to win.2. Yes, it is possible that the producers made the hidden immunity idols intentionally easy to find. However, that does not mean that Russell had any advantage over the rest of the field in finding them. Everyone else had an equal opportunity to find the hidden immunity idols, but only Russell was able to. When combined with the other ways in which he controlled the game (challenges, leading the alliance, etc.), Russell should have won Survivor: Samoa.3. His early-game sabotage is irrelevant. The fact that he burned socks and emptied water bottles has little to do with the game he played and should not be taken into account by an unbiased jury. Also, other factors, such as the fact that he was already a millionaire are also irrelevant.Russell Hantz should have won Survivor: Samoa.\", 'I also want to point out that, as Russell Hantz made the Final Tribal Council, this debate solely is about the jury\\'s decision. Yes, the Galu tribe would have been wise to vote Russell out at the merge, when it had a 8-4 numbers advantage. However, Russell was able to turn the tribe against each other, find hidden immunity idols without clues, and convince Shannon \"Shambo\" Walters to work with his tribe. Also, it is important to note that Survivor is a reality competition show. It is a game that features castaways trying to \"outwit, outplay, [and] outlast\" each other (the show\\'s slogan). That encourages players to fight at all costs to survive and eliminate their competition. As Russell was on a tribe that lost almost every challenge before the merge, his tribe was at a significant disadvantage going into the merge. However, Russell was a brilliant game player and had a strategy to overcome a numbers disadvantage. On Day 1, he made alliances with several members of his tribe, including eventual winner Natalie White. From there, he would vote off anyone who threatened his game. By the merge, all that remained of his tribe was a close-knit group called the \"Foa Foa Four\". He then led Survivor\\'s biggest post-merge comeback ever. Even after Galu voted off Erik Cardona, a member many people did not trust, Foa Foa had a 7-4 disadvantage. So, he convinced Shambo to join his alliance and found a hidden immunity idol WITHOUT A CLUE. He then played it at tribal council, negating the 7 votes cast against him (Shambo was trying to feign loyalty to Galu) and sending Kelly Sharbaugh home. Suddenly, a 8-4 disadvantage had turned to a 5-5 split. Russell then convinced John Fincher, fearing the Purple Rock tiebreaker that could eliminate anyone, to vote with Foa Foa and blindside Laura Morett. Now, Foa Foa had a numbers advantage it would take to the end.', \"Inducting these below average players would not be representative of one of the most profitable, successful, and enjoyable eras in all of baseball. Yes, in hindsight, it was an unfair advantage, but virtually everyone was doing it. To leave out Bonds, A-Rod, Clemens, and Pettite would be leaving out four of the best players of all time (just to name a few). And most doctors have agreed with the point that PED's have a rather low plateau in terms of improving overall game, and that they act more as a longevity helper. Skill is there, PED help keep it going longer. You can't leave out an entire era of baseball, just because the players did what was inherent of the time; take PED's.\", \"The Hall of Fame is merely glorifying the biggest money makers/employees of the league. Sure, you can romanticize baseball, but when it comes down to it, it is simply a business. If you let in the all the average players from the 25 year span of steroid prevalence, you are downgrading the overall quality of the Hall. You call it cheating, but there wasn't rules of regulations put in place at the time. It was stupid not to use steroids during this time. Most players will admit that steroids didn't effect the quality of their game, but rather just helped to extend their career. This may create artificially inflated records, but it's not like Clemens, Pettite, Bonds, A-Rod, Conseco, and Martinez wouldn't have been great players without them. Cheating comes from breaking the rules. No rules = no cheating. Hindsight is 20/20 but you can't penalize people for doing what everyone else was doing. So, should we induct Darrell Strawberry into the hall for being average? No.\", \"Well, we meet again. If we were to prevent MLB players from entering the Hall of Fame because they used steroids; nearly every All-Star from 1980 to early 2000's would be ineligible. Take a look at the Mitchell Report, and you will find a list of incredible players which is far too long to list on here, who would all be banned from baseball's greatest honor. Steroids were just as part of the game during the 80's and 90's as Peanuts and Cracker Jacks. It was an era of steroids. If you weren't using them, then you were considered abnormal. You cannot fault an entire generation of players for just being a product of the times. I agree that records, such as the HR record broken by Bonds, should have an asterisk with them, but this should not be the case with the Hall of Fame. If we were to do what you propose, then from 1980 to 2000 there would be about 5 people in the Hall.\", \"I am not saying all average players should make it but what about above average players who werent as good as the ones that used steriods?

You think there going to tell you, yeah it helped my game out a lot, they wouldn't say that. They are lying you, they make a false claim with no evidence to support that claim. They have no evidence it didn't effect their game. Why do you think they call it performance enhancing drugs, key words performance enhancing. Do you understand what performance enhancing means? It means that it improves your game, so them saying it didn't is lies. If steriods didn't enhance each players game play why would they ban it?

You said that there are many \"incredible players\" in the Mitchell Report. Don\\'t you think maybe they were so incredible because they used steriods and performance enhancing drugs? If they didn\\'t use them they wouldn\\'t be as good as the stats show. I understand players are out there to get theirs and get as much money as they can, but what about the true players of the game who aren\\'t using these performing enhancing drugs.

This includes Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, and all the other players that used them. I believe that if you use these you are getting an advantage that everyone else isn't. They didn't hit all these home runs off of there pure talent and skills, they needed a booster to get where they are and they cheated. They should never be able to be among the Hall of Fame electors like Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron who did it with out performance enhancing drugs.\", 'lol well I addressed 1 yes but I think these points can also be applied to 2 and 3., let\\'s see. For 2, Religious minorities have not \"flourished\" under Islam. In fact, they have dwindled to mere shadows after centuries of persecution and discrimination. Some were converted from their native religion by brute force, others under the agonizing strain of dhimmitude. What Muslims call \"tolerance,\" others correctly identify as institutionalized discrimination. The consignment of Jews and Christians to dhimmis under Islamic rule means that they are not allowed the same religious rights and freedoms as Muslims. They cannot share their faith, for example, or build houses of worship without permission. Historically, dhimmis have often had to wear distinguishing clothing or cut their hair in a particular manner that indicates their position of inferiority and humiliation. They do not share the same legal rights as Muslims, and must even pay a poll tax (the jizya). They are to be killed or have their children taken from them if they cannot satisfy the tax collector\"s requirements. For hundreds of years, the Christian population in occupied Europe had their sons taken away and forcibly converted into Muslim warriors (known as Jannisaries) by the Ottoman Turks. It is under this burden of discrimination and third-class status that so many religious minorities converted to Islam over the centuries. Those who didn\"t often faced economic and social hardships that persist to this day and are appalling by Western standards of true religious tolerance and pluralism. For those who are not \"the People of the Book,\" such as Hindus and atheists, there is very little tolerance to be found once Islam establishes political superiority. The Quran tells Muslims to \"fight in the way of Allah\" until \"religion is only for Allah.\" The conquered populations face death if they do not establish regular prayer and charity in the Islamic tradition (ie. the pillars of Islam). Tamerlane and other Muslim warriors slaughtered tens of millions of Hindus and Buddhists, and displaced or forcibly converted millions more over the last thousand years. Islamists in Somalia behead Christians. In Iran, they are jailed. One of the great ironies of Islam is that non-Muslims are to be treated according to the very standards by which Muslims themselves would claim the right to violent self-defense were the shoe on the other foot. Islam is its own justification. Most Muslims therefore feel no need to explain the ingrained arrogance and double standard. There are about 500 verses in the Quran that speak of Allah\"s hatred for non-Muslims and the punishment that he has prepared for their unbelief. There is also a tiny handful that say otherwise, but these are mostly earlier verses that many scholars consider to be abrogated by the later, more violent ones. As for Sura 109, any true Quran scholar will point out that the purpose of the verse was to distinguish Islam from the gods of the Quraysh (one of which was named \"Allah\") rather than to advocate religious tolerance for non-Muslims. At the time that he narrated this very early verse, Muhammad did not have any power, and thus no choice but to be \"tolerant\" of others. By contrast, there was no true tolerance shown when he returned to Mecca with power many years later and demanded the eviction or death of anyone who would not convert to Islam. In fact, he physically destroyed the cherished idols of the people to whom he had previously addressed in Sura 109. If tolerance simply means discouraging the mass slaughter of those of a different faith, then today\\'s Islam generally meets this standard more often than not. But, if tolerance means allowing people of other faiths the same religious liberties that Muslims enjoy, then Islam is fundamentally the most intolerant religion under the sun. For 3, There is not the least bit of intolerance for slavery anywhere in the Quran. In fact, the \"holy\" book of Islam explicitly gives slave-owners the freedom to sexually exploit their slaves \" not just in one place, but in at least four separate Suras. Islamic law is littered with rules concerning the treatment of slaves, some of which are relatively humane, but none that prohibit the actual practice by any stretch. Vote for me!!!', 'There shouldn\\'t be any argument over who the \"true Muslim\" is because the Quran clearly distinguishes the true Muslim from the pretender in Sura 9 and elsewhere. According to this - one of the last chapters of the Quran - the true believer \"strives and fights with their wealth and persons\" while the hypocrites are those who \"sit at home,\" refusing to join the jihad against unbelievers in foreign lands. In truth, Muhammad organized 65 military campaigns in the last ten years of his life and personally led 27 of them. The more power that he attained, the smaller the excuse needed to go to battle, until finally he began attacking tribes merely because they were not yet part of his growing empire. After Muhammad\"s death, his successor immediately went to war with former allied tribes which wanted to go their own way. Abu Bakr called them \\'apostates\\' and slaughtered anyone who did not want to remain Muslim. Eventually, he was successful in holding the empire together through blood and violence. The prophet of Islam\\'s most faithful followers and even his own family soon turned on each other as well. There were four caliphs (leaders) in the first twenty-five years, each of which was a trusted companion of his. Three of these four were murdered. The third caliph was murdered by those allied with the son of the first caliph. The fourth caliph was murdered in the midst of a conflict with the fifth caliph, who began a 100-year dynasty of excess and debauchery that was brought to an end in a gruesome, widespread bloodbath by descendents of Muhammad\"s uncle (who was not even a Muslim). Muhammad\"s own daughter, Fatima, and his son-in-law, Ali, who both survived the pagan hardship during the Meccan years safe and sound, did not survive Islam after the death of Muhammad. Fatima died of stress from persecution within three months, and Ali was later assassinated by Muslim rivals. Their son (Muhammad\"s grandson) was killed in battle with the faction that became today\"s Sunnis. His people became Shias. The relatives and personal friends of Muhammad were mixed into both warring groups, which then fractured further into hostile sub-divisions as Islam expanded. Muslim apologists, who like to say that is impossible for today\\'s terrorists to be Muslim when they kill fellow Muslims, would have a very tough time explaining the war between Fatima\\'s followers and Aisha to a knowledgeable audience. Muhammad explicitly held up both his favorite daughter and his favorite wife as model Muslim women, yet they were invoked respectively by each side in the violent civil war that followed his death. Which one was the prophet of God so horribly wrong about? Muhammad left his men with instructions to take the battle against Christians, Persians, Jews and polytheists (which came to include millions of unfortunate Hindus). For the next four centuries, Muslim armies steamrolled over unsuspecting neighbors, plundering them of loot and slaves, and forcing the survivors to either convert or pay tribute at the point of a sword. Companions of Muhammad lived to see Islam declare war on every major religion in the world in just the first few decades following his death - pressing the Jihad against Hindus, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Buddhists. By the time of the Crusades (when the Europeans began fighting back), Muslims had conquered two-thirds of the Christian world by sword, from Syria to Spain, and across North Africa. Millions of Christians were enslaved by Muslims, and tens of millions of Africans. The Arab slave-trading routes would stay open for 1300 years until pressure from Christian-based countries forced Islamic nations to declare the practice illegal (in theory). To this day, the Muslim world has never apologized for the victims of Jihad and slavery. There is not another religion in the world that consistently produces terrorism in the name of God as does Islam. The most dangerous Muslims are nearly always those who interpret the Quran most transparently. They are the fundamentalists or purists of the faith, and believe in Muhammad\"s mandate to spread Islamic rule by the sword, putting to death those who will not submit. In the absence of true infidels, they will even turn on each other. The holy texts of Islam are saturated with verses of violence and hatred toward those outside the faith, as well as the aforementioned \"hypocrites\" (Muslims who don\\'t act like Muslims). In sharp contrast to the Bible, which generally moves from relatively violent episodes to far more peaceful mandates, the Quran travels the exact opposite path (violence is first forbidden, then permitted, then mandatory). The handful of earlier verses that speak of tolerance are overwhelmed by an avalanche of later ones that carry a much different message. While Old Testament verses of blood and guts are generally bound by historical context within the text itself, Quranic imperatives to violence usually appear open-ended and subject to personal interpretation. From the history of the faith to its most sacred writings, those who want to believe in \"peaceful Islam\" have a lot more to ignore than do the terrorists. By any objective measure, the \"Religion of Peace\" has been the harshest, bloodiest religion the world has ever known. In Islam there is no peace unless Muslims have power - and even then...', 'There are some facts to what you said but most is speculation. However, you failed to address my other two points, and so the debate is won by default. 2. Religious minorities have flourished under Islam.

It uses circular reasoning, or it begs the question.B. It special pleads god\\'s exemption.A. By saying that things \"begin to exist,\" you automatically create a set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" and a set of \"things that do begin to exist.\" The problem is that the set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" ends up only having one thing in it, god, which makes separating \"begin to exist things\" and \"not beginning to exist things\" a way to smuggle in god\\'s presumed exemption in the conclusion.The assertion that a thing, god, didn\\'t begin to exist in the premise is simply repeated by saying that god is the only member of the \"didn\\'t begin to exist\" set in the conclusion, which is begging the question or circular reasoning.http://www.logicallyfallacious.com...B. By asserting that everything began to exist, except for god, you are special pleading god\\'s exemption to the assumed rule. Without an explanation of how god should be considered exempt from the category, exempting him is special pleading, thus it is flawed logic and we can reject the conclusions from such.Pro, other than bare assertions, like \"god is uncaused,\" how is god exempt from the beginning to exist rule that you openly endorse?Pro, could you explain the mechanism by which god accomplishes this exemption?If you can\\'t, then how do you know that this exemption has occurred?Pro continues:\"The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause.\"My response:Much like the process of creation, causation is also temporal.This means that time could not have been caused, because causation itself requires time.It\\'s like saying, \"time began to exist as the result of a time event that occurred BEFORE the existence of time.\"The temporal contradictions of creation and causation at [+0,-0] have not been addressed by Pro.Pro baldly asserts again:\"God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused.\"My response:Aside from this egregious tautology, Pro simply asserts that god was uncaused and provides no explanation as to how this is the case.I could just as easily assert that flagoiganberries are self existing beings, uncaused, and need no answer, and I would have accomplished the same level of demonstration that Pro has with his asserted god.Pro tried to draw a similarity between designed-by-human computers and the universe.I pointed out that if Pro is going to say that the universe was designed, which I also reject, like computers, then the universe, like computers, was designed by a natural, not supernatural, intelligence.Pro responds:\"To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\"My response:No, it\\'s another way of pointing out that your \"universe is like a computer\" analogy doesn\\'t support a supernatural entity like your proposed god.Instead, your analogy shows that natural designs come from natural agents, so if the natural universe was designed, your analogy would indicate that a natural entity was responsible; this is not indicative of a supernatural designer, the type of designer Pro is attempting to affirm.Pro continues:\"Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance.\"My response:Yeah, natural entities are responsible for these computer codes, hence why computer codes are not \"magical.\"Pro furthers:\"[Something magically popping into existence is] synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened.\"My response:Well, again, all of the examples EVER of video games have been shown to be designed by a natural entity, but we only have one example of the universe, and it has not been shown to be designed...the absurdity of the random video game manifestation contradicts the many examples of designed video games and is therefore nontransferable to the universe which has no standard examples with which to compare.Pro retorts:\"Con has...declared that there once was no time...time \"became\" at some point...since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist.\"My response:Ah, Pro addressed it finally.Creation and origin are not the same thing.creation - the process of bringing something into existence.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...origin - the point where something begins.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...Time therefore had an origin, a POINT called the big bang, yet it did not experience a PROCESS of being created; that process must occur over time and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof.So, it\\'s NOT illogical to concede an origin, but not a creation.Creation is a series of events and an origin is a point; the terms are different.Pro stays adamant:\"Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause.\"My response:Again, this is like saying, \"Time was placed in motion in the first place by a time-based action.\"How can a cause, a thing occurring over time, happen without time?Pro adds:\"Without God, time and space never roll into motion...it would take a tremendous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from?\"My response:I guess Pro ignored all of my round 2...oh well, here it is in a different way.Quantum fluctuations are what nothing is, and this nothing is unstable; nothing cannot remain, so something, energy, is guaranteed.At [+0,-0], spacetime fluctuated in and out of existence with the other fluctuating variables in quantum fluctuations, but once matter became stative [+1,-1], so did space.At this point [+1,-1], space was as small as a virtual sub nuclear particle, so the proportion of stative energy from QF to such small space was massive...so massive that it drove the inflation of space.http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Pro reasons:\"If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is.\"My response:Did you look at my 2nd round, Pro?All of the answers are there and sourced.But to save you the scroll...Right, at [+0,-0], unstable quantum fluctuations have space, time, matter, and energy fluctuating in and out of existence such that there is no stative time or the passage thereof, thus no temporal concepts like creation/causation occur.But at [+0,-0], once a virtual sub nuclear particle avoids annihilation from its antiparticle, which is the inherent instability of QF, matter, energy, space and time are then stative [+1,-1] and this is the origin of the universe; it\\'s an origin, not a creation.Stative space at this point is so small that any stative energy is proportionally quite powerful-->inflation.Pro ignores my round 2 some more:\"Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint.\"My response:Though it\\'s not a cause, time and space in the first place is not only knowable, it\\'s been demonstrated by the WMAP from NASA.[+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations-->[+1,-1] Big Bang.Here\\'s the model again: http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...Pro gets bold:\"If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity.\"My response:Pro, read my round 2 thoroughly...and check NASA\\'s Big Bang Model that I\\'ve provided twice now.Pro finishes:\"If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless.\"My response:Let me translate.\"This gives a lot of room to the notion of a user of time-based actions that is timeless.\"Pro, do you see the contradiction in your assertions?If the creator is timeless, then why is he defined as a user of time i.e. a creator?', 'Thanks Pro for your response. I maintain that the universe was not created, because of the temporal problems of such a claim. Without a universe at [+0,-0], there is no stative time in order to correctly declare that a temporal process, creation, occurred; no time, no creation, no creator. But Pro doesn\\'t seem to see it that way... *Round 1 Rebuttal* Pro asserts: \"Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event.\" My response: Nope. I\\'ve explained, that without god, the universe has an origin, and, because there is no stative time in [+0,-0] quantum fluctuations, there is no infinity of time; time began when the universe began, so I guess this is our \"first mother.\" Pro asks: \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken.\" My response: Well, you didn\\'t ask me before your assertion about everyone. The egg came first, because mutations that lead to speciation occur in the zygote, which is inside the egg. Therefore, the predecessor to the chicken had a mutation occur within the egg that makes that egg a chicken egg, which lead to the first chicken. The egg came first. Pro continues: \"Many scientists have stated that if the fundamental physical constants were to vary even so slightly, the establishment of matter, astronomical constructs, elemental diversity, and life, as humans know it would have never happened. Reality is beyond a miracle.\" My response: No, you\\'re just calling an after-the-fact result a miracle. This doesn\\'t show there must be a creator, it just shows that the low odds of existence happened. Low odds do not necessitate purposiveness. *Round 2 Rebuttal* Pro claims: \"There is no empty space. There is a \"bubbling soup\" of quantum field fluctuations that come and go quickly.\" My response: I agree, and in this state at [+0,-0], there is no stative time. Instead, time is just another variable that \"comes and goes quickly\" with the other fluctuating variables. So when there was no universe, [+0,-0], time did not remain; it fluctuated. Pro adds: \"In the double slit experiment we see an interesting phenomenon of quantum strangeness. When nonobserved electrons cause patterns of waves. When observed, their behavior and pattern changes based on observation.\" My response: Yup. I fail to see what this has to do with quantum fluctuations or the creation of the universe/stative time, but the double slit experiment shows that particles can be both a particle and a wavelength. Pro then claims: \"SPACE TIME DOES NOT RESTRICT THE LORD\" My response: Aside from this being a bare assertion, the lack of spacetime restricts creation, a process that REQUIRES time to have occurred. No time, no creation, no creator, no created universe. Pro attempts to support this assertion with the bible: \"In the book of John, Jesus Christ made a statement concerning time and its relation to Him...in our sense of time Christ walked the Earth after Moses and Elijah had been dead and gone a long time.\" My response: Pro, why should we consider the bible authoritative on matters of time or the universe? So what if the bible says that \"Moses face was shining like the sun, and the Children of Israel put a veil over his face?\" What does any of this have to do with the creation of the universe? Pro makes another bare assertion: \"There is one way known to satisfy the paradox of infinite causes. If you can name another, go ahead.\" My response: [+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations --> [+1,-1] Big Bang. Check my round 2 for sources on this. Pro continues: \"If you examine a computer and its constructs, you would know an intelligence created it.\" My response: Yeah, and every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity. So, applying this rule to the universe, you should conclude that something natural, not supernatural like god, was responsible. Also, we have only one example of a universe, unlike our many examples of computers from which we can deduce commonalities; or maybe Pro can find another universe that indicates his claim. Pro piles on: \"Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code...it isn\"t just random 1\"s and 0\"s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software.\" My response: Despite theawakenment.com\\'s lack of credibility on matters of the universe or existence, simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe. Pro goes on about genetic code: \"Genomes use the genetic code to write two completely separate languages. The first explains how proteins are made, and the other commands the cell on how genes will be controlled.\" My response: Ok, well when you have a debate about the origins of life, then maybe you could bring this up, but in a debate about the universe, this is irrelevant. Pro then provides a clip from the Matrix to explain \"What is real?\" All the clip shows is that there was a fictional movie made with Keanu Reeves...that\\'s it. Then Pro mentions: \"Einstein...demonstrated time as having a point.\" My response: Yeah, like the Big Bang. Pro adds: \"Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will.\" My response: Ok, but this puts Jesus as the result, not the cause. Pro furthers: \"In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model.\" My response: Nothing about the Big Bang model involves speaking anything...that Genesis mentions light and light is an elementary particle is coincidence and not indicative of Genesis\\'s authoritativeness on matters of the universe. Pro finishes: \"This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority.\" My response: How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself? I\\'m not attacking god, I\\'m attacking the TEMPORAL process of creation occurring without time...it\\'s inherently nonsensical. Pro should attempt to address the temporal problems of calling the origin of time \"creation.\" How do you discern creator from created without time? I reject this resolution, because, without stative time, temporal processes cannot occur.', 'I think this is gonna be a good one. I reject the claim that the universe was created at all, let alone by an agent, including a presumed god. To have something created, brought into existence per this debate, there needs to be stative time and the passage thereof to allow the process of creation to occur. Creation necessarily requires:1. a creator remaining long enough to create2. the action of this creator creating3. the subsequent existence of the created productWithout stative time and the passage thereof, a temporal process like creation, or bringing something into existence, is nonsensical. How could one discern a creator from its created product without the passage of stative time? Creators must precede their creations, and precedence, the fact of occurring earlier in time, requires stative time. I reject this resolution, because stative time\\'s origin and the universe\\'s origin are in fact the same, which negates a temporal process like creation from occurring without the universe. *THE UNIVERSE*All existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. Our universe has matter and space. Matter distorts space and creates gravity. . http://www.einstein-online.info...The way that particle physicists and cosmologists look at the total universe\\'s energy is by the totality of observable matter (you, me, the planets and stars) and gravity (distortions of space). . https://en.wikipedia.org...Matter, in this energy combination, acts as positive energy (+), because matter is doing the distorting. Gravity, in this energy combination, acts as negative energy (-), because it\\'s a result of the distorting. So, what if we could see how curved space is throughout the entire observable universe given this (+)matter and (-)gravity interplay? Well we can, and we have, using the WMAP, which is an anisotropy probe attached to a space shuttle that measures variations in the otherwise uniform Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and gives us a massively accurate picture of the scale, shape, and size of the observable universe. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...We now know that our universe is flat, because the spacial curvature (the total effect of matter on space) of the universe is zero. . http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org...Therefore, all of the positive energy (+matter) is exactly being cancelled out by all of the negative energy (-gravity) in our universe, so that the total energy [+matter,-gravity] of the universe is in fact zero. As a set, the universe\\'s matter and gravity would look like [+matter, -gravity] = 0So, we could imagine what the set might look like currently, given our massive universe of +matter and -gravity. .. [+10000000000000,-10000000000000] = 0This shows lots of +matter and lots of -gravity exactly cancelled out. But when there was no universe, matter and gravity were at [+0,-0] = 0At [+0,-0], there is no matter or gravity to speak of and of course the total energy is 0. In this zero energy state, there is/are no radiation/particles/wavelengths/matter/energy/space/time/gravity. .. nothing [+0,-0]= 0. So, for this debate, I will be referring to the otherwise inaccurate phrase, \"before the universe,\" as [+0,-0], when there was no universe. *QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS (QF)*In our universe of space and matter, when you strip \"something\" of particles, radiation, and energy, you are left with nothing but empty space; this empty space is full of quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are sub nuclear particles (not actually full particles, which is why some physicists call them \"virtual\" particles) existing and being annihilated by antiparticles, and the forces between these sub nuclear particles fluctuate along with this existence and annihilation. I have to make this point perfectly clear. These sub nuclear particles fluctuating in and out of existence are what nothing is, and this is always the case. This is what nothing is. . http://scholarsresearchlibrary.com...The article above refers to quantum fluctuations as vacuum fluctuations because, in our universe of space and matter, we\\'ve detected these fluctuations by using a vacuum that strips the basics of something from empty space. But the sub nuclear particles in QF are something, right? Nope. They never statively exist; they exist and don\\'t exist at the same instant, and it is this fluctuation that makes up nothing. There is no \"nothing\" without these fluctuations, period. What is nothing? It is a state of fluctuating sub nuclear particles and their forces called quantum fluctuations. That video is short and explanatory of QF = nothing. Quantum fluctuations are as real as microorganisms, and we\\'ve demonstrated and measured their effect, in current space, in detail. . http://physics.aps.org...However, at [+0,-0], unlike our current universe, there was no space, and instead, like the forces between the sub nuclear particles, space and time fluctuated along with the sub nuclear particles. Space is merely the position of matter or the distance between matter; matter dictates space. At [+0,-0], in a quantum fluctuation, a sub-nuclear particle exists and is simultaneously annihilated by its antiparticle, and this pseudo moment allows for the fluctuated existence/nonexistence of space and time and the forces between the sub-nuclear particles; this was the condition at [+0,-0], which is a constant fluctuation of time/space/matter/energy/gravity thanks to QF. These zero-energy quantum fluctuations, nothing, are such an unstable state that energy is guaranteed to be expressed from them; that expression is called the big bang and is the origin of our universe. From nothing [+0,-0] to something [+1,-1] = The Big Bang. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...*THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE - THE BIG BANG*Pro has already conceded that the Big Bang occurred, but in order to explain why the universe couldn\\'t have been created, by god or otherwise, I must explain our current understanding of the Big Bang model. With the right radio telescope, even you can see that the space between the stars above us isn\\'t just black space, it\\'s filled with microwave radiation. . http://science.nasa.gov...All of this CMB radiation, which is a \"black body\" as it absorbs all intercepted electromagnetic radiation, is nearly a uniform glow between stars across the universe, and is a proven indicator of an expandable hot dense state such as the Big Bang being the cosmos\\' origin. . http://www.mpg.de...The small variations in the microwave\\'s uniformity, show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot dense state that has expanded to the current size of the universe; this is called inflation. . http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Yeah, that link is from Cambridge. .. I know, argument from authority. .. go to page 9 of the PDF which is page 2 of the preface. These small variations have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of sub-nuclear particles, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. *THE RESOLUTION IS FALSE*Unfortunately for this resolution, at [+0,-0], in quantum fluctuations, there was no stative time, because there was no stative space. Space and time are part of a continuum, so we call it spacetime. . http://www.einstein-online.info...I reject the claim that the universe has a creator, god, because creation is a temporal process, contingent on stative time, and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof, because there was no stative space; temporal processes like creation are nonsensical without stative time. Therefore, a creator of the universe cannot be, because there is no creator of a universe that wasn\\'t created.', \"*No acceptance round; just start debating.*Definitions can be changed, BEFORE ACCEPTING the debate, in the comments section, as long as both Pro and Con agree, otherwise...*Definitions below are agreed to by accepting the debate.ResolutionThe universe was created by god.ProHas the Burden of Proof and 4 sets of 10,000 characters to AFFIRM the resolution that the universe was created by god.

The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause. God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused. Con stated: \"...every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity.\" To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\" And humans are intelligent agents who designed these computers. * Con Stated: \"...simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe.\" Microsoft and Google were created by humans, which are intelligent agents who created such software. Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance. It\\'s synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened. We know this is impossible without an intelligent designer. And our reality is much more complex than Call of Duty 4. We are talking about Grand Theft Auto on super steroids in our case of reality. I assume Con does not believe in magic, nor do I. * Con said: \"How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself?\" Con has with this statement declared that there once was no time. Time \"became\" at some point. This would indicate that time being put into motion in the first place was caused. He says that without time there \"could be no creation\", yet must cede that there was a \"creation\", whether by God or by something else all together, otherwise we wouldn\\'t exist. There was a beginning event that propelled the start of our reality of space and time. Since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist. We need an agent to start the process that is beyond time, seeing that without time we can have no creation event otherwise, according to Con. Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause. What is that cause? God? Something else? Without God, time and space never roll into motion. A stationary time and space sounds nice, but potential is not potential at all without a cause. It\\'s like watching a leaf sitting in one spot for an hour. Suddenly it picks up, moves across the yard, and goes into motion. Why? It\\'s motion had a cause. Without the wind or some other external cause, the leaf would not move. Thus, it is the same with time and space. It would take a tremedous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from? If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is. * Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint. If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity. * If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless. So what do we know in accordance with Con\\'s assertion of stationary or nonexistant time. 1)Time did not exist/was not in motion, and yet we exist. 2)Whatever the cause is of the creation or putting into motion of time, is timeless and not affected by time, otherwise nothing would have happened, thus we would not exist. 3)If causes can be non-effected by time and be causes in the first place, then whatever is the construct of that system allows for a timeless creator. Something must be beyond time if Con\\'s assertion is 100% true. He must show evidence of a cause that is beyond time and space.', 'There is no empty space.

He is surrounded by mighty winds that destroy boulders, the Earth quakes, and then he sees a flaming fire consumed with the Lord\\'s voice, which is described as gentle and quiet. He begins speaking to the Lord. (1 Kings19:8) https://en.m.wikipedia.org... In our sense of time Christ walked the Earth after Moses and Elijah had been dead and gone a long time. In the New Testament Christ had a perplexing event where His disciples were terrified at what was happening and could not understand it. \"Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.\" (Matthew 17:3) When whatever was happening initially stopped, Jesus turned towards them and... \"There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.\" (Matthew 17:2) When Moses prior, in Exodus, finished speaking to the Lord...

How can our reality have no first event, be infinite, and yet still be? Well, let\\'s see what the Science Advisor to the President of the United States of America says. -James Gates, Physicist and Science Advisor to Barack Obama. James Gates and his researchers discovered something very intriguing buried within the mathematical equations of super symmetry. What did they find? They found computer code. Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code. This is a specific type of code referred to as \"self correcting code\". Richard Hamming established this coding system building on the concepts of Claude Shannon. Thus it is sometimes called \"Hamming Code\". And it isn’t just random 1’s and 0’s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software. http://theawakenment.com...

Let\\'s check it out. \"What is real\"? http://youtu.be... *In reality we do not need an answer for the answer if the answer is from beyond our reality. If the answer is from this reality, it demands an answer for the cause of every caused thing in an infinite regress. We must have a singularity somewhere. This singularity must come from outside, or beyond our reality. Once we establish it as the answer, we do not need an answer for the answer. When the answer comes from beyond our reality, it becomes a futile thing to attempt to define the construct of anything from beyond our reality. But, you know me. I\\'ll give it a go.Einstein referred to time interms of upper dimensions. He demonstrated time as having a point. From the point time could go in any direction as if in upper dimensional space, similar to how we move on a complex highway system, forward, to the left, up, then back down, and all around. Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will. From that point of \"time and space\" He can go to \"the beginning\". He can go to \"the end\". He exists as born, a man, creator, and finisher. He Himself said in the book of Revelation, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega. The beginning and the end.\" In 1 John he is referred to in the status of that all things that exist exist only from Him. In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model. In Revelation, God has come finishing it all. Via prophecy, God declared the beginning from the end. If He truely knows the end, He exists in the future, in the past, and in the present. He is omnipresent. This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority. He is timeless, immaterial, yet material all at once. He is the singularity. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient as a programmer can be all of those things over the worlds he creates, thus it is with God, yet with more complexity than man can comprehend. The Alpha is the cause of the beginning. The Omega is cause of the end.', 'Atheism is logically impossible. Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken. Why? Because the human mind knows that we must have a first uncaused cause. It\\'s common sense. The concept of everyone having a mother, yet there being no \"first mother\" is obviously absurd and illogical. The same applies for causes. Everything was caused, but there is no first cause? It\\'s identical logic. Thus, we cannot exist...unless...there is a cause from outside of space and time existing beyond the laws of science and time as we know them. * Atheistic Philosophical question- \"How can God exist beyond our reality?\" How can a computer programmer exist outside of the video game he creates? They just do. That is simply reality as we know it. --- The universe began to exist.

The original argument was that there should be intelligent life \"teaming\" across the Milky Way. After years of searching audably and by sight, nothing came to fruition. This phenomenon was so named the Fermi Paradox. Where is everyone? An original model of what conditions must exist for a planet to support life became bigger, and bigger, and bigger until... Carl Sagan in connection with this equation came to an interesting conclusion. He said that NO planets can support life. (That would include Earth.) The given number was 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 in probability, and equated to a quarter coming up heads a quadzillion times in a row for the environment of Earth to exist at all. ----- It took the blink of an eye for the equation of our existance to manifest itself. If any one thing had been different, our universe could not exist at all. Many scientists have stated that if the fundamental physical constants were to vary even so slightly, the establishment of matter, astronomical constructs, elemental diversity, and life, as humans know it would have never happened. Reality is beyond a miracle. ----- Fred Hoyle who coined the term \"big bang\" said the findings of science had shook his once unmoved belief in Atheism to its core. Paul Davies described how he \"loved Hoyle\\'s maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy.\" * The DNA code, based on \"codons\", informs and programs a cell\\'s behavior. Wikipedia describes codon as such: \"A codon is defined by the initial nucleotide from which translation starts. For example, the string GGGAAACCC, if read from the first position, contains the codons GGG, AAA, and CCC; and, if read from the second position, it contains the codons GGA and AAC; if read starting from the third position, GAA and ACC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5\\' to 3\\' direction in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence. With double-stranded DNA, there are six possible reading frames, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand. The actual frame from which a protein sequence is translated is defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG codon in the mRNA sequence.\" Codes? Design? You tell me.

This is not where the definitive answer lies. Religion is the study of the supernatural. This is where the answer lies. ** The Bible told the future of the world. In the Bible, God declares that the world would find freedom and blessing through Isaac. He declared the world would reap a curse from Ishmael. So what right? It goes on to tell us that the descendents of Ishmael will be violent with their hand against each other and against everyone else. Ishmael is the father of the Arabs. Ishmael later became known as the father of Islam. It tells us Ishmael\\'s seed would be slaves to the end of days. Muslims later chose to refer to themselves as the \"Slaves of Allah\".

Strangely, thousands of years later the New Testament, as confirmed by Christ, depicted this battle exactly as it is today in ways no one could have known. (Genesis 3:15)Finally Christ depicted the condition of the world as that many would fall away from the faith. Atheism is on the move in all of the West and quickly. He said the world would go into economic collapse, become ungodly, have perplexing world issues, the youth would become rebellious to authority and their parents, people would begin to rebel against and mock God, and \"knowledge\" would be the cause.

First of all, I do know something about both games. I have Guitar Hero 2 and 3, AND Rock Band. ok. 1. Yes, there are two sets of buttons, but they do basically the same thing. Are they in the same order? Yes. Are they anything THAT different? No. 2. I never said anything about difficulty, and difficulty doesn't always make a game better. But if we're talking about difficulty, the drums are definitely in question. The drums are DEFINITELY a source of difficulty in the game. Also Harmonix did that ON PURPOSE, so the game is more accessible to people on their first time playing. Because of this, more people can play, which links to my argument of MULTIPLAYER experience. More people play=fun to harmonix standards. 3. This argument of videos makes little sense. You argue that guitar hero has more videos than rock band on youtube, but how does that make guitar hero any BETTER? Just because something has more videos, is it better? No. This means nothing with your resolution.\", \"First of all, I see this is you're first debate on debate.org, so I'll be the first to say welcome! Haha Ok, now to the debate! Guitar Hero is a great game. However, I don't think how fun it is compares to Rock Band. Guitar Hero can do whammys, online play, and co-op, but Rock Band can do it too. Rock Band can use guitar hero guitars, so anything that a guitar hero guitar can do, Rock Band can. Its awesome, but rock band can do it too What guitar hero DOESN't have is the multiplayer experience. Rock Band has guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, while Guitar hero only has guitar and bass. This means that co-op mode on Rock Band is WAY more fun. Also, Rock Band has a great song list, that anyone can like, because there is variety.\", \"yo man you know notin first of all the guitars in rock band have two sets of buttons and one side doesnt really i've tried and the game rock band is easy on drums guitar bass guitar and definetly microphone the songs on guitar hero are challenging and guitar hero is really famous even check on youtube you will find more guitar hero vids than rock band and how many games does rockband made so far so haaaaaaaaaaaaa\", 'i think guitar hero is better because they have cool attacks such as amp oveload or whammy those are cool and guitar hero has 5 games. guitar hero is for the 360, ps2, ps3 and thats it. also you can play online with other people and also co-op mode and really nice songs please vote for guitar hero!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'When you wrote: \"Kidnapper states \"yes we are breaking the law but everybody here understands that it is our tradition and you can\"t change it.\" (3.37) I believe you are mistaken about what part of the law the kidnapper was referencing. While it\"s true that kidnappers were aware that their actions were against the law, the breaking of the law discussed in the video is almost directly pertaining to the act of the kidnapping itself. They admit that taking someone off the street by force is wrong. What I don\"t necessarily see in your premise is how kidnapping on its own can be linked to the occurrence of rape. It\"s unlikely that they believed that their actions are contributing to the girl being eventually raped and most likely they were convinced they were simply following the tradition. The best man even states that if they were stopped by the police, they simply would have clarified that kidnapping was part of a wedding party, and that would most likely suffice as an explanation (20 mins-20 secs). Your claim: \"At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)\" has some determination problems as well. The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. I fail to see how the time interval between kidnapping of the bride in the video and her eventual decision to consent is conducive to her consenting to marriage and sex. At the time of consent during the wedding ceremony, the use of force during kidnapping seems already irrelevant in her decision making. When she says \"yes\" to marriage, she already has full autonomy and is undeniably aware that she can say \"no\" without any fear of harm being done to her. It is possible that, in the situation when she does not consent, the process of convincing her to marry could perhaps go on for days (15 mins-00 secs). In that case, mental and physical fatigue could be a contributing factor in obtaining consent and initial use of force during kidnapping could be linked to eventual sex. That though, has not taken place in the video. I do see problems with this claim as well: \"A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) \". Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).', 'The main principle regarding the act of rape seems to always be centered on the determination of consent by both parties at the time of the intercourse. Refusal and consistent resistance to being penetrated would be considered as sufficient evidence that a victim did not consent to have sex. But when you state in your second premise that \"most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted (160.7.4)\" we enter a gray area of judgment. I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of nonconsenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear. What non-traditional rape standard often is unclear about and what it fails to produce is a distinctive criterion of nonconsent. Your premise of \"nontraditional rape being quite similar to what happens in many bedrooms across America (161.4.1)\" seems to reflect that very notion. If all sex is coerced in some way (161.3.1); the line between consensual and forced sex can be unknowingly crossed at any point, and lack of consent is not properly communicated, is it not possible that cases of mistaken consent could be a regular occurrence? No two people are the same, so experiences with a certain similar group of people might be our only guide about typical behavior related to that group. It is possible that a man has repeated certain type of seductive behavior with a number of women and was never made aware by any of them that his actions went too far. At that point it is possible that he has determined certain aggressive behavior as acceptable. In \"Rape\" Susan Estrich uses an example of Pat and Rusk. Pat is a young woman who met Rusk at a bar and later gave him a ride home. At one point, when she declined twice to go up, he took her car keys and she followed him to his apartment. The two proceeded to have sex. While Rusk\"s action to grab car keys might seem to be excessively forceful and without a doubt surprised Pat, at no point in his room did he say or indicate that any harm would be done to her if she doesn\"t cooperate with his wishes. His controlling demeanor and aggressive tone caused Pat to assume and articulate possible negative consequences of nonconsenting, without there really being any evidence that would suggest possibilities of bodily harm. His decision to walk Pat to her car and ask if they could meet again would further imply that he might have been unaware of any wrongdoing (171.4-172.4). What Pat and Rusk example demonstrates is how difficult it is to determine intentions in a non-traditional rape; and how any situations, depending on each party\"s position, can be a subject to different interpretations. In bride kidnapping the only real use of physical force occurs during the kidnapping itself (12min30secs-15mins40secs). Assuming the resistance is not a preplanned part of the wedding proceedings, this is the only time that the woman\"s freedom is restricted and her pleas are ignored. After the bride regains her autonomy, she seems to make a conscious decision to continue the marriage ceremonies. Since the kidnapping is the only means of physical force that was used, it seems safe to assert that physical force or threat of physical force was not a factor in the women\"s decision to marry. Therefore it is important to examine whether psychological manipulation or fear was a decisive element in the bride\"s decision. Unlike the woman in \"Rape\", who\"s unfamiliarity of the man and her surroundings led to her consenting out of fear, the bride in the video has known the groom for some extended time and was romantically involved with him (4mins 40 secs). She was fully aware that she will not experience any harm if she does not agree to marry and the video indicates that her family was aware of her location. As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress. The bride in the video, after the initial vigorous resistance, just seems to give in way too easy; and only moments after she was given her freedom back. When you reference that kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice (27.15)\", I find it hard to believe that no other alternatives were available in this situation. There is no evidence she even considered or discussed other choices and, like you stated in your argument when you wrote: Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1). Additionally, your claim that \"she understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present\" is completely subjective as far as determining the presence of a choice inhibiting fear. Her assumed resignation to her fate should more likely be attributed to her upbringing in Kyrgyzstan, rather than fear of any repercussions as a result of saying \"No\". She was more likely brought up with an instilled knowledge that in a situation like this, its proper for her to eventually agree since it is a part of a long lasting tradition (27mins09secs).', 'In her article \"Rape\" Susan Estrich analyzes various cases of rape and identifies certain, ever present, elements that categorize the act of rape in two distinct groups: traditional rape and non-traditional rape. Traditional rape is mainly related to the \"use of force\" or a clearly articulated \"threat of force\", where intentions of a perpetrator are unmistakable and there is a definite absence of mistake. Non-traditional rape differs in a way that less force or no force is used, threats are not necessarily articulated and there is a possibility of mistake regarding consent (160.7-161.1). VICE documentary, \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\", looks more closely at the local Kyrgyzstan tradition of marriage by kidnapping, where a woman is taken off the streets and ultimately convinced to marry her kidnapper. The video follows actions of a young man as he is preparing to kidnap and marry his girlfriend. While there are elements associated with this event which could be interpreted as evidential of rape, certain circumstances surrounding this particular couple structure the following argument in a way that negates an occurrence of rape. 1.) The rape is defined by judging the victim\"s response to the act of having sex (162.2.4) 2.) Defining nonconsent is difficult in cases where certain cultures find it proper for female to act nonconsensual when pursued by male, even if she is actually consenting (177.5.2). 3.) The actions of the victim need to completely and beyond a doubt express the lack of consent (164.4.2). 4.) For a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1). 5.) For rape charge to be held, it is important to prove perpetrators intent and absence of mistake about consent (163.6.3). 6.) The man has known the woman for a long time and they have both discussed a potential marriage in the future (4 mins-45 secs). 7.) The marriage by kidnapping is a tradition in Kyrgyzstan that allows women to consent to marriage while still remaining \"innocent\" and not coming off as desperate to marry (16 mins-10 secs). 8.) Getting married by kidnapping could be a part of an agreement between the bride and the groom, where kidnapping part is staged by two parties (23 mins-05 secs). 9.) The woman showed she was capable of physical and verbal resistance (12 mins-33secs) but ceased to resist and express her nonconsent when she was given back her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). 10.) While having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says \"yes\" (26 mins-53 secs). 11). It\"s customary in Kyrgyzstan to have sex on the wedding night (30 mins-35 secs). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12.) Since the bride willingly consented to marriage, the husband is not guilty of rape. Determining whether a traditional or non-traditional rape occurred is heavily based on establishing the presence of force or threat of force during or leading up to the act. The victim has to demonstrate clear, unquestionable resistance to taking part in the sexual act, either physically or verbally; or indicate that her consent is obtained through fear, where she believed not cooperating might result in a serious harm to her person. In cases of the traditional rape, where a stranger uses physical strength or weapon to overpower or completely intimidate the victim; uses threats of doing harm if she doesn\"t cooperate, and then proceeds to have intercourse with the victim, there is a very little question when it comes to the lack of consent and the resulting crime of rape (160.7.2-3). The determination becomes inherently more complex when it comes to the issue of non-traditional rape. Unlike the stranger with a weapon example, these cases might involve numerous circumstances where perpetrator and victim might have a mutual history or were engaging in the dating process. For majority of societies, romantic encounters and dating situations are characterized by an aggressive, pursuant behavior from men and passive behavior from women (161.5.2-3). For many women it is of the utmost importance to maintain an image that they do not easily engage in sexual relations; and even if they are willing to consent to intercourse, they might only communicate their intentions through subtle hints. The decision on the level of aggressiveness required in such cases will fall squarely on the male; and without clear guidance from his partner, it might be up to him to judge what constitutes acceptable behavior and what could be thought of as too forceful. If the female is too passive and unable to express her lack of consent, it is entirely possible that the male acted with an understandable notion that his partner fully consented by letting him take the charge (177.5). \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\" could illustrates that exact point. The couple has been romantically involved for some extended amount of time. They discussed the idea of marriage and were both fully aware that marriage by kidnapping is a common tradition in their culture. Union through this type of tradition was even prevalent among their nearest family members, dating couple past generations (27 mins-10 secs). The girl\"s mother admitted to actually agreeing to a marriage by kidnapping, which could indicate the physical and verbal resistance during kidnapping was only a part of marriage proceedings and not a manifestation of her lack of consent (23mins -10 secs). That notion seems to be supported by her quick submission, especially after she regained her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). Not only she stopped any form of resistance, but she seemed to be genuinely smiling while going along with the remaining proceedings. Even when given another chance to demonstrate her nonconsent and unwillingness to marry, the woman says \"yes\" when asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage. Since she agreed to be married and spend the weeding night with the groom, his actions in the video do not evidence that rape or nontraditional rape occurred.', 'When you state that \"The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from\" I believe you are missing the main point of my previous argument. The fact that rape occurs not only in the United States, but all over the world does not make the cultural importance of \"No\" means \"Yes\" philosophy in Kyrgyzstan irrelevant. I will argue that cultural connotations of that philosophy are directly relevant to the marriage by kidnapping tradition. The importance of local culture and tradition are the basis for judgment not only for the kidnapper, but also for the victim. It would be absolutely ignorant and culturally elitist to interpreted actions described in the video only from the viewpoint of an outside observer, where interpretations of the events are made strictly using one\"s own personal culture as comparison basis. While a person in United States might view the tradition of \"Bride Kidnapping\" as an unquestionable crime of rape, the culturally relevant observer might see that event as simply an everyday typical occurrence, socially valuable to Kyrgyzstan culture. Your claim that \"the law cannot protect a man because his traditions are different\" only applies when that tradition is not under the jurisdiction of that law. Indeed, the U.S law would not protect a bride kidnapper if he committed the act on U.S territory. You can\"t use the term \"law\" as something that has the exact universal meaning all over the world, because it obviously does not. What constitutes as punishment for theft in U.S might not even remotely be similar to type of punishment for the same act in other parts of the world. So when you again state: \"So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes it as a whole\" I feel you once more elected to rely on law standards not relevant to Kyrgyzstan and imposed law and social ideology discussed by Estrich, which mainly focuses on U.S law. Neither the groom nor the bride in the video is living under that set of law. The bride at no point in the video indicates that the actions taken by the groom was a violation of her person and she eventually accepts the events that unfolded as a natural occurrence, a part of her nation\"s tradition. She is initially upset for the way she was taken but that initial struggle is quickly replaced by realization that she is participating in that tradition, at which point she is willingly accepting the notion of getting married (27mins09 secs). In conclusion, I believe it is unreasonable to judge the young men in the video as a person who committed an act of rape. The use of force illustrated in the video and demonstrative lack of consent by the kidnapped woman was no longer relevant at the moment when the bride willingly agreed to become his wife. Even the initial harm done to her during the process of kidnapping was eventually interpreted by her as way of following the local tradition. The required in the crime of rape guilty intent was not present at any point during the act, from the moment of kidnapping to the wedding ceremony; everyone involved, including the bride, believed that following the tradition absolved him from anything that could be judged as intentional wrongdoing. If an argument could be made here, it is for the abandonment of the tradition itself on the moral basis, but the actions taken by the groom in the video do not evidence that a Rape of nontraditional rape occurred.', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 3 The following claims that you have made directly prove my argument. \"I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of non - consenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear.\" and \"As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress.\" It is exactly statements such as these that show the bride was pressured so severely that her mindset transformed into the idea that if she agrees; what follows would be the termination of the pressure and convincing from all of the woman that have surrounded her. Furthermore she understood through her tradition that these events of convincing can take minutes, hours, or even days, so it has been established that these convincing ceremonies could be endless. A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) The following claim that you have made is irrelevant because the \"amount of time\" need not be specified in order to constitute grounds of rape. \"The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. \" It is legitimate to punish the man who chooses to ignore explicitly the words of protestation coming from that woman. With quite certainty if is safe and necessary to say that \"many women who say yes \" whether on dates or on the job \" would say no if they could ; I have no doubt that women\"s silence is sometimes the product not of passion and desire , but of pressure and pain.\" (181.1.1-2) Most importantly the amount of time that has passed between the kidnapping and the actual act of intercourse; is not basis to exculpate the kidnapper. At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 2 Your premise number four has proved exactly my point on the undeniable accusation that the kidnapper has performed an act of rape. Your premise goes as follows: for a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1) It is exactly through manipulation and fear of force that the kidnapee agreed to the marriage. The bride to be confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she had no other choice but to stay and therefore agreed to the marriage. (27.5) This demonstrates the idea that women often feels that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) Further more the standard of physical force, or threat of it, to constitute sex as rape give men an easy opportunity to claim that from what they understood; the women gives consent to the act. (164.3.1) This demonstrates clearly that the bride to be had no choice but to say yes and agreed to the marriage on the grounds that she completely lacked power in any other choice. She understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present. \"From a woman\"s point of view , the danger in this position where women -might in fact find themselves in a situation where they in saying yes really mean no- is that many women who say yes are in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say no.\" (177.5.1) Next, your tenth premise can be easily challenged. You have made a claim that \"while having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says yes\"(26.53) It is absolutely outrageous to somehow make out that this woman in the video was considered of her autonomy in any respect. If her autonomy was respected, first off she would not need to have been kidnapped in order for her to agree to a marriage with this kidnapper. The fact that the actual sex took place after the marriage is completely irrelevant because the sequence of events that led up to that night have stripped this woman completely of her autonomy, therefore leaving her no choice but to follow along with this situation which has consumed her. For the central role of consent, the justification in the law of rape is that it protects a woman\"s choice the autonomy of a woman in relations to sex. (175.4.1) Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) The following statements which have come directly from the video, reveal that the autonomy of the all the women was not considered in any of the following scenes: \"Father of groom states \"Be careful not to let her run away.\" (2.25) \"While a random bride is being dragged into the apartment she is pleading\" she does not want to stay and please let her go\" (2.51) \"There was a situation of a man and a woman who were in love, the woman wanted to marry him, but she explicitly explained that she did not want to be kidnapped and didn\\'t want to partake in anything following the kidnapping which and almost all cases consist of consummating the marriage. (3.14) \"After several years of marriage a couple is asked to reflect on the events that brought them together. The husband admits that when he met her he asked whether or not to send his parents for work or should he just kidnapped her right on the spot? and her response was \"don\\'t do it\" (3.58) \"When the male and all his friends went to retrieve his bride the young man states \"you can beat us or even cry\" they then proceed while the woman screams out to her mother as she kicks and screams. (12.39) \"Bride confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she have no other choice but to stay and agreed to the marriage. (27.5)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 1 Author Patricia Smith makes it clear on what grounds and individual should be convicted of rape and she works beyond basic ideologies to show that rape in fact has occurred in some situations where it would be easy to think otherwise. Patricia Smith provides evidence to show that the kidnapper in the video in fact is guilty of rape. Most importantly she recognizes the distinction between negligence and purposefulness but stands firm that it is quite irrelevant to establish which of the two it is when convicting an individual of rape. She claims as follows: 1)In society both men and women have gotten used to the norms of male aggressiveness and female passivity. (161.5.2) 2)Most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted. (160.7.4) 3)Rape is not the only crime where the relationship before the crime took place between the characters is considered by prosecutors in screening the case, but it has yet to be questioned whether or not considering the prior relationship in rape cases is less justifiable or different than considering it in an assault case. (160.2.4) 4)At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4) 5)Practically all jurisdictions have adopted \"force\" or \"threat of force\" grounds to which determined a rape has occurred. (167.5.1) 6)The central role of consent in the law of rape exists to protect a women\"s autonomy and a women\"s choice in the case of sexual relations. (175.4.1) 7)Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) 8)Kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice.\" (27.15) 9)When Bride is asked how she feels at the moment she explains how she wanted to cry earlier but now she is extremely tired. (26.27) 10)\"Understandably some men in our society have honestly believed in a different reality of sexual relations and that many may honestly view such situations differently than woman. But it is precisely because men and woman may perceive these situations differently and because the injury to woman stemming from the different male perception may be grave that it is necessary and appropriate for the law to impose a duty upon the men to act with reason and to punish them when they violate that duty.\" (166.6.2) 11)The conduct a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) 12)\"So, too, for threats of harm short of physical injury and for the deception and the false pretenses as methods of seduction. The powerlessness of women and the value of bodily integrity are great enough to argue that women deserve more comprehensive protection for their bodies than the laws of extortion or fraud provide for money.\" (181.2.1) 13)Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) 14)Some feminists have argued that there needs to be a political revolution in order to counteract the traditional approach to rape, which is a failure. Unfortunately in most cases what passes as sex in our society, is in reality coerced. There cannot be any distinction between rape and what occurs in many bedrooms across our country. (161.3.2) 15)\"If in 1986 silence does not negate consent, at least crying and saying no should.\"(161.5.6) 16)A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable. (163.6.2) 17)A negligent rapist is still a rapist and should be punished. It is justifiable that knowledge of the risk is sufficient enough to determine blame. (165.5.1-2) _______________________________________________________________________ 18)The kidnapper is guilty of rape. Although this kidnapper seems to have overcome the female where she feels she has no choice but to go along with his plan; that does not provide legitimate means to prove that he is not guilty of rape.', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 4 When you say this: \"Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).\" you are further proving my point as to why the law should address all areas as well as all individuals with the same respect. The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from. Because of the traditions there, the society is more patriarchal therefore often times favoring the men in the criminal law. This does not necessarily mean that rape has not taken place.\"Most of the time, a criminal law that reflects male views and male standards imposes its judgment on men who have injured other men. It is boys rules applied to a boys fight. In rape the male standard defines a crime committed against woman, and the male standards are used not only to judge men but also to judge the conduct of woman victims. Moreover, because the crime involves sex itself, the law of rape inevitably threads on the explosive ground of sex roles, of male aggression and female passivity, of our understandings of sexuality \" areas where differences between male and female perspective may be most pronounced.\" (160.4.4-7) Rape cases almost entirely disregard the defendant, and focus on the behavior of the victim, which is based on a male standard of what is appropriate behavior of a woman. (162.2-3) \"The study of rape as an illustration of sexism in the criminal law also raises broader questions about the way conceptions of gender and the different backgrounds and perspectives of man and woman are encompassed within the criminal law.\" (160.4.1) So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes as a whole. If one individual murders another one what follows is necessary punishment regardless of what region you are from. The same concept should be applied to rape. One cannot be punished differently or not even accused of a crime which would have different circumstances in the for example the United States or any other progressive region. The conduct of a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable.

Secondly, abuse and discipline are two different things. Although some people may argue that it is a form of discipline, abuse does not necessarily correspond with it. As you stated, \"depression and PTSD are some of the long term effects when discipline becomes abuse\", shows that abuse is the reason of the depression and not the discipline itself.

According to lbschools.net, Schools where uniforms are required have seen a 95 percent decrease in crime, 90 percent decrease in suspensions, and vandalism on school property decreased by 69 percent. Also in Long Beach, California, where school uniforms are required almost everywhere since 1995, the average cost of uniforms per year is roughly $60 to $70.\", 'School uniforms help schools portray discipline.

That would be much cheaper than trying to get the newest clothing per year and spending money so that the child can have a new outfit of the \"coolest styles\" each day. School uniforms also try to keep the school itself united. The uniforms help diminish economic and social barriers between students.

Clearly, this should not be possible with lbschools.net, boasting a 90% decrease.

Clearly, this is contradictory to “land of free.” To add, it apparently “[interferes] students' right to choose their dress…[Violating] First Amendment rights (Mitchell and Knechtle, 2003).” Thus, apparently this is militarization and constitutional infringement.

I would think that evil would lie with humans. And yes what is evil may be subjective in the form of small things like animals I am talking big league when it comes to evil. For example, Hitler is evil his motives may seem good at first however in the end his motives was because he was a selfish dick who wanted more than he had and he died from it, of course before his death he killed 11 MILLION people you can not justify that as good. That was plain and simple evil', 'I look forward to what you have to say', 'You say that evil does not exist from the points you made so this is what I will do. Lets see what you said There is no objective evil? Not true the best example I have ever heard for evil is, evil for evils sake, which means no ending purpose, just for the hell of it Like I said with the one above there is a direct point of view of evil IT does not change what people think of it does, again you have to look at it objectively which most people can not do You can infact measure evil, here is a article I found with what most would consider a accurate scale about evil http://www.npr.org... So for my final thing I just want to say, everyone can agree that good exist in the world yes? then you believe in evil and the reason why is because for good to exist there needs to be a opposite so we can know the difference. Like for light to exist then dark has to, it is the same principle. That is why evil does exist', \"But that's thing thing Hitler did not do it because he thought it was best, he did it because he thought that he and all who looked similar to him was better than everyone else. Yes the mass populace may say that this is bad and that is bad but you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad .For example in the holocaust Hitler killed more than Jews he killed EVERYONE that was not a perfect arion which is why it was evil he did not do it for the best of Germany he did it because he wanted to and he thought he was better and that arions were better, so saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\", 'the Google definition of evil is \" profoundly immoral and malevolent\" and exist as \"have objective reality or being\" Evil is an idea that can not exist in the real world The idea of evil by its nature is subjective. You may think an action is evil but another person may claim it is good. For example one may believe that killing any living thing is evil, where others may say that killing animals is just part of life. Here are some questions than may arise. Who\\'s beliefs are correct? and what if killing one things saves five others? Is an evil action always evil or can exceptions be made? and finally how gets the right to answer these questions? so evil is clearly not objective I also want to talk about volition. Most people would agree that killing is immoral. An earthquake may kill people but an earthquake is not malevolent, it has no will to kill people. Most would agree that an earthquake is not evil it has no freewill. Say some is killed by an animal for food is that animal evil? It is just following its instincts it did not relay have an active choice in the madder. People also follow there instincts and there brain reacts to outside stimulus. so if the brain controls peoples actions, and has no power over the outside world can they relay be evil or act evilly? I would say no. I also want to say morals change with time, and what one group thinks is immoral another might have no issue with, so I ask can something be evil today and not be evil in say 100 years? There is no way to measure or quantify evil, and there are a lot of grey areas about what is and is not considered evil. this lack of agreement shows the frail nature of the idea of evil, and its inability to exist in the world.', 'A short debate with 3000 characters per round.', 'You have yet to convince me that evil exist and I think I have made some compiling arguments against the idea of evil.I want to quickly comment on some of your last points You say Hitler did not think it was for the best, he do it because he thought aryans where better than everyone else, but those are not exclusive he could think and did think both. He wanted to have the people he thought where best to run things because if they where the best, giving them power would be for the best. Hitler also was not aryan, so he clearly was just not thinking about himself. Also on that point just because it was not best for Germany does not mean he did not think it was best for Germany.You said \"you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad\" I agree with the sentiment, but since there is no objective bad, nothing can be called really bad. This idea also works for evil, since there is no objective evil there is nothing that is truly bad.The final thing I will say on your points, you said \"saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\" with this you are not wrong I would say a serial is not evil same as I would not call Hitler evil. more so in the case of serial killers, many of whom have mental disorders. I would say in cases of serial killers with a disorder it is not to different from the animal killing people, and we agreed that the animal is not evil.To bring it all together, evil is not real because1 There is no objective evil 2 Ideas of evil change and vary -This is why people who kill like Hitler are not evil, but we can agree it is tragic that the people where killed. 3 It can not be measured or Quantified', \"First I would agree that what happened to the Jews in W.W.2 was tragic, and that Hitler played a huge role in that tragedy and is an undesirable human. However that does not mean that he is evil. He did what he thought was best for himself and Germany, so I argue this does not prove evil exists. I want to make a more abstract example, say there is an election, I think candidate A's views are immoral and and bad for the country, but that does not make him evil. I have my right to think candidate A is immoral but it does not make him immoral. The lack of evil does not mean that people still can't think this or that about anything. One could even think that someone is evil, but it does not make it so, same as one thinking the world is flat makes the world flat. I want to comment that just because something is not good that does not mean it is evil. Good is also very subjective and what is good for the majority may not be good for the minority and vice versa.\", 'I fully welcome my opponent\\'s unconventionality, and shall follow suit. Since my opponent has not justified his framework, not has he made positive arguments generally (as opposed to assertions), I am free to do the same. I will, in this round, present two arguments, each negating the resolution, based on two contrary assumptions (the first, that a constitution may have authority extended through time, and, the second, that a constitution cannot), such that, no matter what my opponent makes of the framework in which I am working, my conclusion is inevitable. Note that this is in direct opposition to my opponent’s unwarranted decree that “Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed” – I must only argue that it should not be a living document (which includes an utterly impotent, and, therefore, de facto nonexistent constitution). I do not challenge my opponent’s acceptance of “natural rights”, but the exact list of rights he is accepting must be clarified before discourse may be had. So that there exists no ambiguity, I will operate with the assumption that the primary right is the Right to Autonomy, which has corollaries: the Right to Property and the Right to Self-Ownership. The Right to Autonomy states, generally, that each man has the right to exercise their own free will; the Right to Property that each man has the right to act exclusively over unclaimed material or material within his domain (this right also establishes the right to domain); the Right to Self-Ownership that each man must be treated as property of only themselves (unless they sign themselves into slavery), which, as explained, implies that they have exclusive control over their own person. If my opponent wishes to challenge any of these rights, I will present their justifications. The way my case is constructed means that, if my opponent cannot show that the Constitution is not “dead”, then it does not and should not have authority. Therefore, many of my opponent’s arguments work towards my conclusion. To give the foundation of my argument, I present passages from Lysander Spooner’s No Treason/Constitution of No Authority. Quoting the noble man on why Constitutions bind only those who signed them, and only on the terms that they signed them under: “Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but “the people” then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves. Let us see. Its language is: “We, the people of the United States (that is, the people then existing in the United States), in order to form a more perfect union, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” It is plain, in the first place, that this language, as an agreement, purports to be only what it at most really was, viz., a contract between the people then existing; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those then existing. In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies that they had any right or power, to bind their “posterity” to live under it. It does not say that their “posterity” will, shall, or must live under it. It only says, in effect, that their hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to their posterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety, tranquility, liberty, etc.” And on why those bound by it must have signed it of their own accords: “The laws holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed, the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to sign it, or to bind himself by it. [...] Neither law nor reason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, until it is written; for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning. And when it is written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its precise legal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he will agree to it or not. And if he do not THEN sign it, his reason is supposed to be, that he does not choose to enter into such a contract. The fact that the instrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it, goes for nothing. Where would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring into court a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have it enforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that this other man had promised to sign it? [...] The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority from the Constitution — from an instrument that nobody ever signed — would spurn any other instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them for adjudication. […] Moreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, but must also be delivered to the party (or to some one for him), in whose favor it is made, before it can bind the party making it. The signing is of no effect, unless the instrument be also delivered. […] The Constitution was not only never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody, or to anybody\\'s agent or attorney. It can therefore be of no more validity as a contract, then can any other instrument that was never signed or delivered.” [2] Prong the First: If a Constitution is to Have Authority, it Must Not Change This is obvious by the fact that a contract is binding only insofar as it was consented to, and that “progress”, no matter to what end, would obliterate the ability for the terms of a contract to be specified (and therefore it could not be agreed to – empty and tabula rasa contracts are not contracts). Prong the Second: If a Constitution Changes, and Therefore Has No Authority, it Must be Discarded My opponent’s arguments mostly reject the consistency of our Constitution, and, therefore, we move to this prong. This conclusion is clearly given when one accepts that an improper contract is not binding; therefore, my opponent has shown that a living Constitution would be impotent, and, therefore, neither practically nor morally desirable. In addition, my opponent must recognise the difference between holding that a specific Constitution, by definition enduring, should be living, and that morally bankrupt Constitutions should be destroyed and replaced by More Perfect ones, and, if such replacement is impossible, just destroyed. My opponent needs to justify why the first would have been morally superior for, for example, Rome.', 'I accept.', 'what a clown', 'On Framework Note, here, that my opponent claims to have accepted my list of rights. Afterwards, he argues against the primacy of autonomy (saying that it must be compromised in the advance of something “greater”). He must have been very confused; there is no other explanation for this massive lapse in understanding. I specifically noted that the Right to Autonomy was the “primary right”, and other rights were corollaries. Given that my opponent has still presented no justification for his framework except for saying, descriptively, that certain things are “just” or “respectful of dignity” (which my opponent seems to believe counts as proving it so), there is absolutely no reason to accept the “appended” rights he tries to tack onto my own framework. Indeed, the very fact that he ACCEPTS my framework and then argues against its fundamental nature should be enough to discredit his attempts at consistency. The question one must first ask in this debate is \"By what standard am I to pass moral judgement?” I pose one simple challenge to both my opponent and the reader: find any answer which does not, at least implicitly, require autonomy of the Will. You will find that you cannot. This being so, it is clear that, unless my opponent decides to finally offer a positive argument, my a priori true position must be accepted prima facie. Defence1. Consent of the Governed Quoting Ayn Rand: “A right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone’s permission. If you exist only because society permits you to exist—you have no right to your own life. A permission can be revoked at any time. If, before undertaking some action, you must obtain the permission of society—you are not free, whether such permission is granted to you or not. Only a slave acts on permission. A permission is not a right.” It should be clear that I am not arguing that justice is “up to a vote”, or whatever other ridiculous position my opponent wishes to paint me as holding; justice is the protection of consensual relations and the destruction of all others. This is much different – justice is not “majority rules” or arbitrary under my theory, but, rather, justice itself is the principle of free association with the world and others. This is why my opponent’s rant about how “What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people“ falls flat; that which professes to protect rights cannot itself be a slavemaster. Thus, my opponent’s strawman is burnt to a crisp. The point made by my opponent about “practicality” is also worthless; is the unjust, then, to become just because it is expedient? I see no reason why one cannot consent to everything done to them; my opponent has a totally unjustified pessimism towards freedom. Also, I do fully believe that starving is oftentimes consensual. I have no problem biting the bullet; it’s your job to show why I’m wrong even if I do get around your silly reductios. Moving to another of my opponent’s scattered chains of twisted logic, he takes for granted that doing “beneficial” things is never unjust. This, while literally true, attempts to smuggle something past the reader: it assumes that non-beneficial actions actually are, in order to prove their moral acceptability. This is a ruse. He says himself that the reason the theft of the apple is a crime is the absence of consent. There are no two ways about this: Pro has unequivacly conceded that a possible distinguishing factor of a criminal act, as opposed to any other act, is a lack of consent. This, in itself, torpedoes the argument that consensual action is not an end in itself (and also the idea that “kind things” are always just). If that done without consent is criminal (and therefore unjust), and benevolent actions are always just, nonconsensual actions must always be unbeneficial. Q.E.D. I leave you with this unjustified, out-of-context segment of Robert Nozick (Anarchy, State, and Utopia is very relevant here) that should, in itself, be just as weighty as my opponent’s unjustified, out of context segments of Dworkin, and far weightier when taking into account my positive arguments for my framework: “Political philosophy is concerned only with certain ways that persons may not use others; primarily, physically aggressing against them, A specific side constraint upon action toward others expresses the fact that others may not be used in the specific ways the side constraint excludes, Side constraints express the inviolability of others, in the ways they specify, These modes of inviolability are expressed by the following injunction: \\'Don\\'t use people in specified ways,\\' An end-state view, on the other hand. would express the view that people are ends and not merely means (if it chooses to express this view at all), by a different injunction: \\'Minimize the use in specified ways of persons as means.\\' Following this precept itself may involve using someone as a means in one of the ways specified, Had Kant held this view, he would have given the second formula of the categorical imperative as, \\'So act as to minimize the use of humanity simply as a means,\\' rather than the one he actually used: \\'Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end. Side constraints express the inviolability of other persons, But why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm: we go to the dentist to avoid worse suffering later; we do some unpleasant work for its results; some persons diet to improve their health or looks; some save money to support themselves when they are older. In each case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall good, Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good? But there is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to him for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this up. (Intentionally?) To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has. He does not get some overbalancing good from his sacrifice, and no one is entitled to force this upon him-least of all a state or government that claims his allegiance (as other individuals do not) and that therefore scrupulously must be neutral between its citizens.\"2. Rome (An Exercise in Inconsequentialism) My opponent makes the rather unconvincing argument that, had the Romans made a new Constitution, it would likely itself have been in opposition to liberty, and thus the proper thing to do is not to make a new Constitution. The problem is obvious: I did not advocate for the creation of any Constitution, only a Constitution of a certain… constitution. Unless my opponent is fully committed to the idea that it is physically and logically impossible that such a Constitution be created, he must admit that it is possible, and thus relevant to the moral discourse. If this is done, it is clear that, of the choices, a new and truly just Constitution would be the obvious best. In conclusion, I wish the reader to keep in mind that my opponent constantly appeals to dignity. I ask: What is more dignified? Self-determination or subjugation? To quote, again, Senpai Nozick: “The minimal state treats us as inviolate individuals, who may not be used in certain ways by others as means or tools or instruments or resources; it treats us as persons having individual right with the dignity this constitutes. Treating us with respect by respecting our rights, it allows us, individually or with whom we please, to choose our life and to realize our ends and our conception of ourselves, insofar as we can, aided by the voluntary cooperation of other individuals possessing the same dignity. How dare any state or group of individuals do more. Or less.”', 'Thanks to Shab for accepting this battle to the death debate.Untraditionally, I will not be laying out a framework for this debate yet. Instead, I am merely going to present facts this round, which I will use to make my case in the next round. Assume that my framework is natural rights; if Con doesn\\'t contest, this is the framework we will use. Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed. Accordingly, these facts I present will be used in the next round to accomplish two objectives: 1) to show that the Constitution should be living, and 2) to show that the Constitution should not be dead. Because it can only be one or the other, judges should treat both types of arguments as positive arguments that advance my case. How the Founders Intended It?Significant hullabaloo is raised by some in defending the \"original\" Constitution. However, the Constitution from its inception was actually intended to be a living document, according to a significant number of its creators and ratifiers. The Constitution was not a coherent statement of ideology, outside of certain vague commitments to liberty. It was the product of compromise (1). Specifically, the compromise was between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists would find camaraderie among the originalists today. The Federalists included John Marshall, a delegate to the Virginia convention to ratify the Constitution, and the fourth Supreme Court justice, responsible for the creation of judicial review (2). It is important to note that judicial review stems from no explicit constitutional authority authority whatsoever--it is truly one of the first and most famous examples of the living constitution, far before the phrase was coined. We can indeed see this same evidence of two interpretations of the constitution in the debate over the Repeal Act in 1803--\"[T]he Federalists urged that the constitutionality of the Repeal Act be referred to the Supreme Court. The Republicans responded that the people, not the courts, were the judges of the constitutionality of acts of Congress\" (2, pg. 313). Furthermore, \"Only 11 of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention, according to Madison\\'s notes, expressed an opinion on the desirability of judicial review. Of those that did so, nine generally supported the idea and two opposed\" (3) We\\'ll return to Justice Marshall later, but for now it is enough to say that originalism was not the doctrine of the Founders. I will explain the importance of this in Round 2. Judicial Review--In Defense of Liberty The GPO has published a handy-dandy list of things deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (4). Of particular note are cases 150, 144, 140, and 133. I will not use them now, but I have acknowledged that as a courtesy to my opponent. The fundamental fact about rights is that, by definition, they cannot be subjected to a vote. Either they exist, or they do not exist, and woe be to the positivist that ascribes only the \"rights\" they like to the people they like--if rights are mutable, they are not rights. A dead constitution necessarily entails that we rewind our conceptions of rights, and of morality, to an earlier, worse time. More than just judicial review, the living constitution approach ensures that the Constitution is a document worthy of respect. The law is not an end, it is a means to the end of the public good. There is no quality of law that gives it an intrinsic utility or moral worth. Even the law of a religious society with religious law is worthless if the law is not followed. To the extent that the law protects the public welfare, it is worthy of praise; to the extent that it damages the public welfare, it is worthy of scorn. One of the great successes of the Living Constitution recently has been Obergefell v. Hodges. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down bans on gay marriage because of the Due Process and Equal Process clauses (5). Both clauses clearly were not meant to apply to gay marriage, and it is doubtful the Founders would have supported gay marriage. Yet, because of the actions of the Supreme Court, gay marriage is legal, and it is guaranteed to remain legal. No legislature can change that. The Living Constitution approach has successfully ensured that the Constitution remains a document worthy of respect that preserves the rights of the people. Rome Quite the segue, eh? This section demonstrates the harm caused when constitutions--in this case, the unwritten Roman Constitution--are insufficient to provide for the people. The beginning of the end of the Roman Republic is generally traced to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus (6, pg. 144). Rome was in dire straits. The poor filled the streets of Rome, and wealth continued to be concentrated in the hands of a few (pg. 145). Tiberius pushed for land reform. Tribunes, as it happened, all had the power to unilaterally veto any proposal, and one by the name of Marcus Octavius did just that (146-147). The common people wanted reform (147). The law was intransigent. The natural response? Tiberius convinced the assembly to eject Octavius from office, a step with no legal precedent (147). For his trouble, Tiberius was murdered by the pontifex maximus and a mob of senators and retainers (147). This set the stage for enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic. A dead constitution goes the way of the optimates--into extinction and irrelevance. It can preserve no freedom in the long run, because it preserves only itself. A living constitution, on the other hand, would have bypassed many of the problems traditionalist Rome had with the populares. It would have enabled Tiberius and others to enact the will of the majority while preserving the rest of the Roman institutions. Attempting reforms under a dead constitution is like attempting a surgery with a battleaxe. You\\'ll get the problem area cut out just fine--and a few other vital organs while you\\'re at it. The scalpel of the living constitution is necessary to preserve this stability.ConclusionIn this round, I demonstrated several strengths of a living constitution, and provided necessary historical context for understanding my case. A living constitution more effectively protects liberties, more effectively allows for reform, and was favored by a good number of the Founders.Sources http://law2.umkc.edu...

Definitions\"Should\" implies moral desirability. A \"living constitution\" is one that \" . . . changes over time, and adapts to new circumstances, without being formally amended\" (1). Generally, this interpretation is opposed to originalism, which states that \"those who make, interpret, and enforce the law ought to be guided by the meaning of the United States Constitution—the supreme law of the land—as it was originally written\" (2).

The exhaustive list of rights is everything that is necessary to provide equal respect and concern for all citizens. According to Ronald Dworkin (Justice for Hedgehogs), \"Someone\\'s total freedom is his power to act in whatever way he might wish, unimpeded by constraints or threats . . . His negative liberty is the area of his freedom that a political community cannot take away without injuring him in a special way . . .\" (366). The distinction between the two is important. Borrowing from a secondary source,Dworkin believes that a right to liberty in general is too vague to be meaningful. However, certain specific liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of worship, rights of association, and of personal and sexual relations, do require special protection against governmental interference. This is not because these preferred liberties have some special substantive or inherent value (as most rights philosophers hold), but because of a kind of procedural impediment that these preferred liberties might face. The impediment is that if those liberties were left to a utilitarian calculation, that is, an unrestricted calculation of the general interest, the balance would be tipped in favor of restrictions. . . . Dworkin says that if a vote were truly utilitarian, then all voters would desire the liberties for themselves, and the liberties would be protected under a utilitarian calculation. However, a vote on these liberties would not be truly utilitarian nor would it afford equal concern about and respect for liberties solely by reflecting personal wants or satisfactions of individuals and affording equal concerns to others . . . because [of] external preferences, such as prejudice and discrimination against other individuals deriving from the failure to generally treat other persons as equals . . . These external preferences would corrupt utilitarianism by causing the individual to vote against assigning liberties to others. Accordingly, the liberties that must be protected against such external preferences must be given a preferred status. By doing so, society can protect the fundamental right of citizens to equal concern and respect because it prohibits \"decisions that seem, antecedently, likely to have been reached by virtue of the external components of the preferences democracy reveals.\" (The Philosophic Foundations of Human Rights, Jerome Shestack, Human Rights Quarterly 20.2: 201-234) Con\\'s first point deals with liberty of contract. His argument basically boils down to the \"Contract? I never signed a contract!\" shtick, and you shouldn\\'t buy it for a number of reasons. First, the principle that liberty is inviolable overrides consent--in other words, rights cannot be subjected to a vote, for the simple reason that if they can be revoked by a simple majority vote, they aren\\'t really rights. Second, consent of the governed is not valuable as an end, but a means to an end. Suppose a woman opposes restrictions on abortion until fetal viability, but the state they reside in institutes waiting periods, requires consent of parents/the court, etc. They did not consent to those restrictions being placed upon people. Even if she are in the government itself, it cannot be said that the women \"consented\" to such restrictions. The sense of consent that Con uses is this broad sense, in which every person must consent to every single law they live under and every condition that would potentially infringe on their freedom, and it is a total fantasy--there is zero possibility of ever achieving broad consent like that. Even in the state of nature, the fantasy land where everyone voluntarily consents to contracts, Con cannot pretend that people \"consent\" to starvation, for instance. If we accept that consent of the governed is thus not a right, then we have destroyed our own framework that we agreed to. The only solution is to change the way we view our terms. If I have an apple, for instance, and a thief takes it without my permission, what is the crime? The crime in itself cannot be my lack of consent; the crime is the theft of the apple, and the lack of consent is why it is a crime. However, say a random stranger, in an act of kindness, slips $20 into my coat. I did not consent to that, but was any crime committed? After all, I did not consent to this action performed on me. Consent of the governed is a means to the end of the protection of liberty--it is not an end in itself. It does not matter that Americans today did not sign the Constitution. If one were to sign a regular contract, ignorant of some of the provisions, and it turns out that those provisions are actually favorable to the ignorant person, there is no injustice. What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people. As Dworkin notes, \" . . . a collective decision to impose a duty not to kill and to threaten a serious sanction for any violation is in itself an insult to the dignity of subjects. On the contrary, your dignity as an equal citizen requires that government protect you in this way. It is not demeaning . . . to accept that a majority of your fellow citizens has the right to fix traffic rules and enforce the rules they fix, provided that the rules . . . are not wicked or desperately foolish\" (Dworkin 367). With this in mind, we must devise a different analysis from what Con has suggested. The measure of any governmental system is not whether it is completely consensual, but whether it is just, and by extension, whether it protects individual liberties. Con\\'s argument is wholly based on contract language, which I have debunked, but his alternatives seem to be meaningless when it comes to protecting liberty--destroying and replacing Constitutions in itself carries no inherent procedural benefit. A Living Constitution does. As Dworkin noted, democratic utilitarian calculations and votes on rights are inherently unjust because of discrimination against others, so the rights cannot be put to a vote. They must be protected by an independent institution--the Supreme Court. Rehashing constitutions every few years or abolishing the constitution is merely a more complicated form of the tyranny of the majority. Extend Obergefell v. Hodges as an example of protection of rights thanks to the Living Constitution. Extend judicial review as another example. Since Con asked me to justify why a living constitution would be superior to a new constitution in Rome, I\\'ll respond to that. The reason is as simple as that a new constitution was impossible to create. As I said last round, there was \"enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic.\" Had new constitutions been made, they would have inevitably slanted toward the more-numerous populares, who were the epitome of majoritarian, as evidenced by the many mobs that they formed to kill political leaders and kick people out of the Senate and all sorts of other fun things (sarcasm).

To support their claim, my opponent provided statistics that date back to 2013 which was a time where technology had just taken a leap. As stated by Alistair Charlton, a reporter at International Business times in 2014, 2013 was, \"...the year existing technology took huge, game-changing leaps forward\". In 2013, phones and such technology was just being beginning to evolve into what it is today. Today, technology has become more incorporated in our daily routines which is why, as stated by Julie Luhrsen, one of the attorneys of Luhrsen Goldberg Attorneys At Law in 2017, \"People who use their cell phones to talk or text while driving are by far the most common reason for distracted driving accidents. In fact, the National Safety Council estimates that 26% of all car crashes involve cell phones\". My opponent utilized the same source I mentioned and stated that there are many other causes of fatal crashes not just texting. Luhrsen did state this but my opponent failed to incorporate the rest of Luhrsen\\'s statement, \"...cell phones to talk or text while driving are by far the most common reason for distracted driving accidents\". This validates my claim that texting and driving should not be allowed or in other words, people should not text and drive, because it creates a major distraction to the driver and not only puts their own life at risk but of those around them. Therefore, people should not text and drive. https://www.lginjuryfirm.com... https://www.ibtimes.co.uk...', 'My opponent stated that people should be allowed to text and drive because it is a convenient and faster way to communicate with others. This is true, cell phones do allow people to communicate with others at a faster, more convenient rate but, they should not be used in any way while driving.

As stated by the Los Angeles DUI Law Office, \"...texting is the biggest distraction we face today and that it is six times more dangerous than drinking and driving. To add, according to the Brain Injury Society, \"Drivers who are texting while behind the wheel have a 23% higher chance of causing a crash. That is equivalent to downing four beers and getting behind the wheel\". This demonstrates how significant the effects of texting and driving are considering that drunk driving was the leading cause of \"traffic fatalities\" for years but has now been overpassed by texting and driving. Therefore, with this in mind, texting and driving should not be allowed.', 'People should not text and drive because texting creates a major distraction while doing everyday functions such as driving. According to the DMV, the Department of Motor Vehicles, \"In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you\\'ve already zoomed past the length of a football field(traveling at 55mph) with minimal attention on the road ahead\".This demonstrates that not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk but it endangers the life of those around you. As stated by the US Department of Transportation\\'s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), \"...causes their own driving to deteriorate and can lead to crashes, injuries and even death...more than 3,300 people were killed in 2011 and 387,000 were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver\".', \"My opponent stated that texting and driving is a major distraction to drivers, however, texting is not the biggest or most fatal distraction. According to Jack Benton, an environment, safety, and health specialist, from Safety News, in a 2013 article, 62% of fatal car crashes were caused by drivers simply being lost in thought or daydreaming. While cell phone use did cause 12% of fatal car accidents, it is far less than the most frequent cause, daydreaming. Texting while driving is also not the only distraction a driver way face when behind the wheel. According to Julie Luhrson, an injury defense attorney, stated in her 2017 article, drivers can be distracted by numerous causes such as noisy children, GPS, and music. Going by my opponent's logic, all of those things should be illegal too. Therefore, it is useless to illegalize texting while driving. https://www.lginjuryfirm.com... https://ehssafetynewsamerica.com...\", 'For this debate, the negative side is arguing that people should be allowed to text and drive. In this day and age, texting has become a very convenient way for people to communicate long-distance. According to the admin from Asia-Pacific Economics Blog in a 2015 article, texting while driving can be convenient if you quickly need to change plans and have to tell whoever you made plans with. Texting is also quicker than talking on the phone. According to T. Griffith from Car Gurus, sending a quick text while at a red light is a safer and quicker alternative to talking on the phone or texting while the vehicle is in motion. With that being said, there should not be an all out ban to texting while driving. https://blog.cargurus.com... https://apecsec.org...', 'My opponent failed to address my claim that if noisy children, GPS, and music are distractions, then they should be illegal as well. My opponent also claimed that cell phones are a lot more dangerous after 2013 than before. However, according to Emma Elsworthy from Mirror, a British news company, stated in a 2017 article sharing the results of a poll of over 2000 applicants, one in five stated that their children were the most distracting when driving, one in six claimed that their partners were the most distracting, and the most distracting were people that drove with their headlights in the dark. Therefore, while texting may be distracting to drivers, it is not the most distracting. With other circumstances proving to be much bigger distractions than texting, it would be irresponsible to illegalize texting before anything else. Therefore, people should be allowed to text while driving. https://www.mirror.co.uk...', 'Higgins, I concede that you may have been my most challenging opponent yet... However I agree that voters should vote based on the validity of our points, as WELL as the number of points we can creatively come up with to support our position. Voters should also take into account the logic and reasoning behind each of our arguments, our gift of persuasion and articulation, and the overall presentation of our ideas to support our claim. With that being said, I would like to point out that not only have I refuted each and every one of my opponents main points, but also provided a sufficient and succesful rebuttal to actually prove him wrong, or at least put a spin on his point to show that in fact his argument really does support the notion that basketball is in fact better than basbeall. Thus in my conclusion I will provide a re-cap of these examples, as well as include a brief summation of the additional points that I have made to which my opponent failed to prove me wrong. Here we go... 1. My opponent argued that baseball was the better team sport, because it put more emphasis on individual success and therefore pressure to perform at one\\'s best, and then collectively add up each teammate\\'s contribution... or something. I replied by reminding him that a team sport is and should not be about individual performance, but rather working together towards a collaborative goal. Win: Me 2. My challenger attempted to argue that a slower paced sport is preferable over a fast paced game; not only do I disagree (as it is, afterall, a matter of opinion) but I trumped his argument by reminding him that with basketball you have more leeway in determining the tempo of the game, whereas with baseball there\\'s really not much you can do to speed up each individual play Win: Me 3. My opponent agreed that baseball and basketball are both equally easy to learn and accessible to play. However I then won this argument by pointing out the fact that baseball players have to invest in gloves or mitts, while basketball players only have to utilize the two \"hoops\" and one (less easy to lose) ball. Win: Me 4. Pro contends that baseball is a better sport than basketball because it provides less room for injury. On the other hand, I argue that the athleticism necessary to play basketball provides for better, more talented and well-rounded athletes to play the game. Plus, basketball is a greater source of exercise than baseball on all levels. Win: Me, Me 5. It was a good idea to contest that a baseball\\'s playing field is better than a basketball court due to the fact that baseball is played outdoors and typically in fair weather. However my argument is that not everyone enjoys being outdoors - especially people with allergies; the cancellation of baseball games due to weather conditions can be disappointing, dissatisfying and annoying to players, fans and those that head particular organizations; basketball can in fact be played indoors and outdoors whereas baseball cannot effectively be played indoors Win: Me, Me, Me 6. My opponent claims that baseball has the most interesting increase and decrease of stats (thus providing for a more exciting Fantasy team experience), as well as the most compelling trades in professional sports. My argument is that the topic of debate is baseball vs. basketball, not Fantasy Baseball vs. Fantasy Basketball. Also, while baseball may have interesting trades going on, basketball definitely has superior free agent makets, so. Win: Me, if anything 7. My opponent discussed the adrenaline rush received from baseball; I argued that beating the the time clock as opposed to playing the set number of innings provide for a greater rush. Win: Me 8. Pro mentioned that more people can play baseball than basketball at a time, because there are 9 people on a team as opposed to 5. However I argued that basketball includes the consistent rotation of players, making it probable that 9 or more players can and will participate during the duration of an entire basketball game. Win: Me, if anything 10. My challenger states that baseball and softball are not sexist. I feel like softball being considered a \"sissy version\" of baseball has a mental impact on people\\'s assumption of the sport, especially young kids (girls). Also, the fact that there is a WNBA is a plus for women\\'s involvement in professional sports. Win: Me 11. As far as strategy goes, my opponent successfully argued against my point that there is more implmentation of strategic planning in basketball than in baseball. However, he did not make an argument for baseball having MORE implementation than basketball, so this point results in a tie. Win: Tie 12. My challenger suggests that a sport bing more lucrative does not necessarily make it better, per se, and I agree. However to come people it DOES make it better... or more enjoyable... so. The win goes to me, but I\\'ll consider it a tie. Win: Tie 13. Pro attempted to refute the fact that basketball requires athletes to play a more equal and engaging part of both offense and defense by stating that you never know which part of the field the ball will be set to play. Or something. And while that is true, it still does not make it less true or more okay that basketball requires more skill and whatnot. Win: Me? 14. My opponent stated that basketball discriminates against shorter or smaller people. I argue that many people have overcome that stereotype and give hope to young people who would also like to overcome adversity for a sport that they love. Win: Me? I believe there were even more arguments in which I have out-debated Pro, however, I will conclude for now due to the fact that my challenger has not beat me on one single point throughout this entire debate. So while I do admit that this debate was (the most challeneing, actually) extremely interesting and well-rounded, and that my opponent gave me a decent run for my money, I would also like to point out that I clearly \"won\" on every single point, and therefore deserve the win. I not only successfully argued against all of my opponent\\'s claims, but also made many of my own that he could not refute. My points were all well though out, carefully constructed, and outnumber my challenger\\'s. In addition they were all pretty clever... heh... so happy reading, and vote Con! Thanks :)', 'Almost ALL arguments made on either of our parts are going to be a matter of opinion due to the nature of the debate topic at hand. It is our job to refine our points and exemplify that our arguments are stronger than our respective opponent\\'s; the better competitor will (hopefully) win the most votes. With that said, I will begin by again refuting your argument that baseball is a better sport because of its slower pace laid-back nature. I disagree, sighting the fact that sports in general became popular and celebrated during the time of the Ancient Greeks, in an era where men participated in the first Olympic games and attempted to display superiroity in various aspects of athleticism. Using their bodies, men came to compete and win against their opponents by methods of paramount strength, agility, speed, talent, wit, etc. Generally, when people are able to move and think at a faster pace, it is deemed a more challenging feat. An example is a timed game of chess; people who perform at top-speed or play chess with a time clock are said to be better chess players. Thus a sport that requires a more fast paced tempo can arguably be considered more challenging when using the logic that I have put forth. More challenging means consistent room for improvement, and a better way to exemplify talent and superiority in various areas practically synonomous with sports (i.e. strength and stamina). Also, not every game of basketball has to be fast paced. There are many teams, in fact, that are actually known to both prefer and excel during a more \"laid back\" game of basketball. However, the benefit of basketball over baseball is that one can always choose to either increase or decrease the level of intensity (tempo) of a game, whereas baseball is pretty consistent with its timing and pace. In regard to a time clock vs. set number of innings required for a game, my point was not to argue that a timeclock is of greater value than a set number of innings or plays, but rather to provide an example of why having to \"beat the clock\" provides a greater adrenaline rush. Like I said, you can\\'t really do much to change the tempo of a baseball game, whereas with basketball you can say, \"Ok - there\\'s only a little time left - we have to pick up the pace!\" The game gets more exciting that way for both the players (who have to think on their feet and perform), and the fans who watch in anticipation to see if their team can overcome the pressure, and prevail by outsmarting and outplaying their opponents. I can also provide a more than sufficient rebuttal to your claim that it\\'s beneficial for everyone on the team to have equal at-bats, whereas basketball consists of various players taking different amounts of shots. My main point is that the concept of teamwork doesn\\'t have to do with individual performances being put together to create one result, but rather a collaborative effort to virtually ignore individual success, and focus instead on the achievements of the TEAM as a whole. In other words, people on basketball teams aren\\'t *supposed* to take the same number of shots. The beauty of it is that each position is equally important and consists of different \"tasks\" and responsibilities. For instance, I would expect a Shooting Guard or a Forward to take more shots than a Point Guard. Reason being that the PG\\'s \"job\" isn\\'t to make baskets, per se, but rather to find an open teammate to pass the ball to in order to complete the play and make the shot. A PG\\'s role is different than a Center\\'s job -- that\\'s the beauty of it. It\\'s different positions consisting of different players working together towards a common goal. I love it. I would also like to argue your stance that baseball encourages more kids to play than basketball does. First of all, basketball players do not usually play for the duration of the entire game. In fact, it is common to see a frequent rotation of players going in and out of the game, thus making it not only possible but actually probable that 9 or more kids can participate on a basketball team. Additionally, since you brought up a sport\\'s accessibility to children, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a cheaper and easier sport to play than baseball. This is because someone would have to buy a glove or mitt to play baseball, whereas you only need 3 pieces of equipment (two \"hoops\" and a ball) to play b-ball. ALSO, due to the smaller ball and overall nature of the game, a baseball is easier to lose than a basketball, thus making basketball the better bet for kids who worry about losing equipment. Again I argue the superiority of basketball to baseball due to its more demanding physical attributes to play the game. I believe that sports were designed to exhibit superior athleticism, and you clearly most be in better physical shape and have more refined skills to play basketball over baseball. Plus, a lot of people play sports as an alternative to straight-up exercise, and basketball provides a MUCH greater work out than baseball, obviously. My opponent is correct in stating that there are neither no co-ed baseball or basketball teams; however, there is at least an official professional level agency for women\\'s basketball, whereas baseball remains off-limits to women once they reach a professional level of their careers. Thus many girls choose to participate in basketball over baseball, because they know they have a better chance of making a living as an athlete if they chose one route over the other. And finally, your argument that it\\'s \"nicer\" to enjoy a sport in sunny weather rather than indoors is lacking, to say the least. First of all, just because you enjoy being outdoors does not mean that everybody else does. What about the millions of people who have allergies and prefer being in a place where they don\\'t have to worry about the downsides to their condition? Second, the cancellation of games due to weather conditions can be both disappointing and a huge inconvenience. This goes for both the players, the fans, and the organizations that run the games. Third, the weather outside - for instance the variation of hot and cold - has an impact on a player and their ability to perform. In an indoors arena, the level of playing field is typically very consistent, and therefore does not deter an athlete from performing at their best. Lastly on this point, you forgot that basketball doesn\\'t HAVE to be played indoors -- there are many, many games and events that actually support and/or mandate that basketball be played outside, where players and fans can enjoy all of the \"sunny weather\" that you promoted in regards to the playing field of baseball. Thus where you can and cannot play a sport and when definitely gives basketball the advantage over baseball. To wrap up this around, I would also like to include several key points, including: A) Basketball allows for more strategy implementation B)Regarding professional sports, the average basketball player earns $5 million; the average baseball player earns $2 million C) Basketball requires more skill because a player must always play both the positions of offense and defense during the duration of a game. With baseball, a player can go an entire game (or even season!) without ever having to be on the defensive end of a play. With basketball, all players are resonsible for equal talent and performance on both ends of offense vs. defense; even if they fail in stealing or rebounding a ball, they still must guard their respective assignment or zone to the best of their ability to prevent their opponent from scoring D) Basketball promotes self-esteem and the notion to try and never give up. This is because small players such Muggsy Bogues stood at just 5\\'3\" tall and weighed a mere 136 lbs, and still made it to the NBA as one of the franchise\\'s most successful players << No more characters :P', 'Basketball is the more popular sport world-wide in comparison to baseball, with basketball being ranked as the 2nd most popular with 400+ million participants, and baseball being ranked 7th with 60+ million participants. Because both sports are played in the Olympics, countries all over the world have had exposure to both games, and by the amount of participants that engage in each we can assume that more people are fans of basketball as opposed to baseball. However I will not assume that more participants worldwide = a better sport. Well, maybe. But not necessarily. Thus I will continue on to state that a lot of basketball\\'s assets, in my opinion, you recognized as flaws. For instance I feel that the fast pace of basketball in opposition with baseball is one of the many things that make it a more exciting game to both watch and play. Each \\'play\\' in baseball can be dragged out and even seem monotonous after awhile (foul ball after foul ball after pitch after pitch after pitch with many seconds and pointless minutes in between). However basketball keeps both the athletes and viewers on their toes, and more plays mean more opportunities for the tone and pace of the game to shift. This gives the opposing team a better chance of coming back to regain the lead, thus making it a more exciting and fun game to engage in or spectate. Plus, having a time limit for a game increases the intensity and adrenaline much more than the rush you speak of in your argument for baseball giving you that same feeling. Another aspect of your argument that I disagree with is when you claim that individual responsibility is *benefit* of baseball. Instead I argue that mistakes are more forgivable in basketball, and thus more emphasis is placed on cooperation and teamwork rather than showing off or stressing over the fact that your performance can either make or break the team\\'s record. How often does a baseball player get blamed when he strikes out in the bottom of the 9th and therefore ends his team\\'s chance of winning the game? However in a game of basketball, even if someone misses the winning shot in the 4th quarter, there were many more shots taken in the game of basketball than at-bats in a game of baseball, making it more apparent that a team\\'s win or loss is not thanks in particular to one individual, but rather the team as a collective unit working together effectively and scoring points. I would also like to take this opportunity to disagree that baseball is a cheaper and easier alternative to basketball. This is because kids can make \"baskets\" out of anything just as you can turn any instrument into a \"bat\" of sorts. For instance, you can use a trash can, basket or even drawn-on square box to serve as a \"hoop\" and just about any ball that bounces as a ball. You can even play by yourself if you had to... Furthermore, I would like to elaborate and correct you on your argument that baseball is a safer game than basketball to play. While it\\'s true that you will probably sustain more injuries in a game of basketball than a game of baseball, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a more physical game, and with that intense level of athleticism being demonstrated you are bound to come across both pros and cons in terms of rewards and potential risks. For example, you may be more likely to strain a muscle while playing basketball; however, basketball is a sport that requires more physical activity and stamina. Thus the benefit to this \"risk\" is the fact that basketball keeps you in much better shape than baseball does. This becomes apparent when you take a look at the physical fitness of basketball players vs. the physical health of baseball players. Basketball players have to spend long periods of time running back and forth, and constantly moving various parts of their body at the same time. It provides a great cardio work out, and keeps the muscles flexible, loose and strong. Due to the easy-going and less strenuous nature of the game, baseball players can get away with being less agile and less healthy individuals than basketball players. Thanks to an organization like the WNBA, basketball has become a more popular sport due to its mass appeal geared for and towards women. Instead of creating an \"inferior\" sport like softball (many people feel like it\\'s a sissy version of baseball), women are actually encouraged to participate in a sport like basketball, and can now even go Pro. Additionally, college basketball programs are FAR more successful than their baseball and softball programs (times ten). In response to a ball park being an ideal place to hold a sporting event, I disagree based on the reasoning that you can play basketball in any type of weather condition during any particular season. Whereas a baseball game can be rained out, or ended early on account of drizzle or snow fall, basketball is played indoors and is therefore more convenient/consistent. You mentioned that baseball was relatively easy to learn; I\\'ll argue that basketball has rules and goals that are just as simple. At the same time, a certain amount of planning and strategy (not to mention practice, training, strengthening and conditioning) goes into basketball While you contend that baseball has the most compelling trade aspects in any realm of professional sports, I\\'d like to point out, \"The Larry Bird rule that gives NBA teams the right to match deals in order to keep their stars gives basketball the advantage\" -- Baseball America. With that, I think I\\'ll go to bed for now. I feel like I have sufficiently responded to each and every one of your points, and in turn made some arguments of equivocal or greater value to prove that basketball is in fact the superior of the two sports. I now leave it up to you to respond, and in my next argument I will be glad to refute any of your additional points as well as provide some more of my own for a final rebuttal in the third round. Thank you and good night :)', \"Again it becomes apparent that the differentiation of the two games only lead to a matter of opinion. .. While I think a slower paced game is more enjoyable, you have argued that the opposite can be said of other people. And since more people do enjoy basketball over baseball according to statistics, I suppose you do have a good point. However I ask that voters vote not based on the number of reasons that one challenger provides the other, but rather the validity of our points, and our ability of one opponent to outtalk the other and provide for a more convincing argument. On a final note I would like to state for the record that I do believe my points have more relevance and certainty than my opponents, and I would like to take this final opportunity to argue some of her last points. Here we go. .. A. Basketball does NOT in fact allow for more strategy implementation. There is an equal or more amount of strategy that goes into baseball. This is because a batter can choose a number of routes that he wants to go, for instance, attempting to hit the ball to a particular side of the field, bunting over swinging, intentionally being hit by a pitch, intentionally walking or striking out, etc. A player can also choose to steal bases, go for a double play over a single play, attempt to run home after a catch is made in the outfield, and more. A pitcher has a variety of pitching options to choose from, etc. And managers and coaches alike have to use their smarts to come up with the best route to receive the best result, so don't give me any of that crap that basketball rquires the most strategy or plays because that is simply not true. B. Basketball might be more lucrative than baseball, so what. That doesn't make it better. C. This much is true, basketball players do definitely have a chance to play more defense than baseball players. However baseball players still always have to be on their toes just in case a play comes to them. The suspense is that you never know where the ball is going to be in play.\", 'Based on you turning my position of basketball\\'s flaws being assets, I think it\\'s fair to assume that it is simply a matter of differing opinions and therefore neither can be regarded as fact. So for instance, I say that baseball\\'s slower paced tempo of the game is of better value than the upbeat pace of basketball, because it provides for a more relaxing sport to watch and laid back sport to play. You get to compete athletically without too much exhaustion which can and does make the game more enjoyable for certain people. To refute your point that basketball is greater than baseball because there is a \"time limit\" per se, my argument is that there is also some kind of limit on baseball as there are a set number of innings (unless the game goes into extra innings, the way basketball can go into overtime). To argue that basketball is more of a team sport because there is less individual responsibility, I also say nay... I feel as though each individual performance collectively adds to the team as a whole; everyone has equal amount of at-bats to make things happen, whereas in basketball not everyone takes the same amount of shots. I agree that both baseball and basketball are of the same accessibility to play- touche. However on that note I would like to point out that baseball encourages more kids to play, be involved and participate in a team sport because each team requires 9 players instead of just 5. Thus more kids can play in the game without having a lot of people \"sit out\" or whatever. I also think that the lesser \"athleticism\" you need to play baseball is actually a good thing. People who want to have the option to train their bodies, work hard, stay in shape, etc which will undoubtedly improve their performance in the game. But those who want to remain physically unfit also have the option to play (ie: a position like 1B where there is little amount of running or moving required). Softball is not that popular, but just as there are no co-ed basketball teams, there are no co-ed baseball teams; that doesn\\'t mean that baseball discriminates against women. And the less popularity of a sport doesn\\'t make it less awesome, you\\'re right. For example most people would argue that soccer or \"football\" is the best sport, but if you look at the numbers in this country, soccer doesn\\'t even come close to being considered the favorite or most widely played. I personally enjoy the fact that baseball has to be played in nice weather. It provides a nice atmosphere for players and fans alike, plus it gets people outside and enjoying the sunshine for a change. And that\\'s about it for now.', 'Although both baseball and basketball are both popular team sports, there are many advantages that baseball has over basketball making it the better of the two games. For instance, while both sports promote teamwork and a collective effort by all athletes on their respective teams, baseball allows for a greater aspect of personal responsibility. Each member of the team has the opportunity to literally \"go to bat\" for their team and make an impact on their teams standing and the entire game. Also, teamwork is necessary to complete many plays such as the double play, triple play, 2B or SS cut off on a throw to home plate, or even to get a guy out at 1B. But at the same time, each player has to do their part in order to complte the play, thus putting a certain amount of pressure on the player and creating a good kind of stress or adrenaline rush that makes the game more exciting and fun for both the athlete and the audience. The slower paced game of baseball is one of the main reasons why it remains such a popular sport and \"America\\'s favorite past time\" ... because you can sit back, relax, have a beer, and enjoy the game without always having to be so riled up all the time. Though baseball definitely has its exciting moments, and the thrill of your favorite player hitting a home run or grand slam never gets old, its definitely a more chill game that provides for a different type of viewing experience. For people (kids) who want to play baseball at home, but don\\'t have a lot of money for equipment, they\\'ll be happy to know that you can make a bat of just about anything... a stick (stickball), a paddle, a raquet, etc. And just about any type of ball... wiffle ball, hand ball, tennis ball, etc. can be used for a baseball. You can make bases out of just about anything too, even draw them on. And gloves may or may not be necessary depending on the type of ball and \"bat\" that is being used. But my point is that it is not a terribly expensive game to play. The rules of baseball are pretty easy to learn, making it easy to grasp and a fun time for both beginners and champions alike. Baseball is one of the safest sports you can play; there is little wear and tear on an athlete\\'s body (that\\'s why baseball players have a longer career that athletes involved with other sports) and there is a lesser chance of injury than say with basketball which is known to give its players knee problems, ankle injuries, and more. Professional baseball is played in a ball park, which is a traditional gathering spot for friends and family to meet up and have an infamous ballpark frank, or spend the day together taking in a good game. Professional baseball also has the most compelling trades and interesting increase and decrease of stats, also making it the most fun Fantasy pro sport game. Baseball has been around longer in the United States than basketball, and it has earned the title of our National Pastime because so many Americans are fans. It is a fun game on any competitive level, and the better of the two sports by far. Your turn!', 'Your last comment about redundancy is an excellent description of this debate. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. \"punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child.\" This is statement is correct if saying it from the viewpoint it is looked through, a human society viewpoint, civilization and acts of human being towards other human beings.

To interject your own opinion about what was happening to Job and ignore the person that was experiencing it, not to mention, actually talking to God, heck... to believe that the events were not false and that Jobs knowledge (because that\\'s what the bible says it is) is false is a fallacy in it\\'s own merit. I\\'m sorry I\\'m breaking my rule: \"Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals...\" <---- Steals?

It was Job\\'s friends who accused him of sinning, and it was Job who openly challenged God to prove that sin was a cause of these events, because again Job KNEW this was not the case. \"Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN...\" <----- You have this 100% backwards, it was Satan who started this all because he wanted to wager a bet that Job would curse God. \"...(you know, the most evil entity ever).

This is ultimately shot down with Romans 2 that says: \"\"13for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified. 14For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,\"\" [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. \"[NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others.\" <----because I was busy making that case that this is not true...I am being redundant now, guilty! \"Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human? That\\'s taking it a bit too far.\" <----Now I know your not reading your bible... Jesus took it that far by starting this parable with \"For the kingdom of heaven is like...\" C: God\\'s \"right\" MkII \"No. Creation of something does not imply ownership, especially when free-will and sentience are concerned.\" <------ You mean the free-will and sentience that... God created...? Also implying that God is above morality is implying the appeal to authority fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org...... Please, do not argue that because God is perfect, the system must be perfect. That is beneath you.\" <--- First off, I genuinely accept that compliment! That made me feel special coming from someone yourself. And I would never dare to resort to such childish tactics that unstable Christians resort to[yes I said that]. I must add though... to be fair... that the bible...which is true for this debate... does say \"As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.\" - Psalms 18:30. I didn\\'t argue that... technically the bible did that one! Thanks again!', 'Before I begin, I would like to say how much I admire your constant stable minded attitude toward responding. A true logical mind indeed you are... something I aspire to attain to perfection if that were possible. I do accept the note of not correcting your responses but just responding to them. I do have to admit that I did not attack or even touch the topic of God dealing with Sodom and Gomorrah, and unfortunately must decline the opportunity again because, like others, this \"problem\" can automatically be answered by addressing underlying issues. One of these underlying issues that was accidentally assumed, and not picked up by myself in the opening of this debate, was \"a baby\\'s innocence\". 1.\"A baby\\'s innocence\" I am almost afraid that if this point is not fairly discussed and unskewed, then this debate will reflect the same direction. I must bring this debate back to the rule of \"for the sake of this argument the Bible is true.\" That means that for the sake of this debate, even cute, innocent looking, tiny, can\\'t-make-proper-decisions-for-themselves babies are in fact just as sinful as us adults who can and do sin on purpose. \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin my mother conceived me.\" - Psalms 51:5. \"The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth. They have venom like the venom of a serpent; like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, or a skillful caster of spells. O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord\" - Psalms 58:3-6 2. \"The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.\" (Job 1:21) If there is anyone in the Bible that has the right to complain about God being immoral, it is Job! He had his own children taken away amongst other horrible things, and yet he states that the Lord has the right to do so hence, him praising God after. I am compelled to reinstate that this is not Jobs opinion, but KNOWLEDGE of the Lord. 3. The idea that \"God NOT giving people a second chance is not fair.\" I formed this educated assumption by \"P1\" which says \"God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them.\" To say that God didn\\'t give them a second chance is to automatically admit they did something that is deserving of some sort of punishment. Plain and simply put I will answer this in the form of a question...how is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God? And just in case this turns into a \"well, they didn\\'t know they were sinning against God\" issue... Romans 1 says \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness, 19 because what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes \" his eternal power and divine nature \" have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse.\" Levitus and Numbers, as you know, even goes on to talk about even \\'unintentional sin\\' or unknown sin must also be offered a sacrifice. 4. God\\'s right to choose. \"P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell.\" This is simply God\\'s right to choose, in this case, he chose to keep a promise made to Abraham, because God is faithful in his promises. Let me fairly remind you that he almost broke this promise as my previous argument shows [which is another debate in it\\'s own]. Matthew 20:1-16: 9 \"The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. 10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12 \"These who were hired last worked only one hour,\" they said, \"and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\" 13 \"But he answered one of them, \"I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn\"t you agree to work for a denarius? 14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15 Don\"t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\" C: One of the most common mistakes that happen when humans question God\\'s moral compass is to imply that God is not the creator of the morals. God alone has a right reserved to take away anything and everything according to the bible. Unlike us, he created everything and according to the bible IS everything. God also, unlike us, is not only sinless but void of sin. These are major contributors, when understood, to God\\'s \"seemingly immoral, genocidal, murderous\" ways.', 'As a preface to anyone who is viewing this debate: 1. Whether you are Christian or Non-Christian, please view the facts as they are presented as unbiased as possible... otherwise the voting could never truly reflect the facts \\'not opinions\\' presented as they are for THIS debate. I thank the Pro for providing the only ground work for this type of debate... and something that even you the reading must agree to for the sake of voting properly. 2. \"Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true.\" <--- As per the Pro. 3. Also reader, please note that he does use the term \\'true\\' and not \\'real\\'. So you must accept, for the purposes of this debate that EVERYTHING the Bible says is \\'TRUE\\' and not false. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. First Rebuttal: 1. \"The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity.\" -Surprisingly this was actually my first statement that I was locked into and I realized that there is actually flaw to this statement. The flaw is the word humanity! The definition that is. You see if I were to take your rules seriously about this debate than this statement is done out of ignorance. I could literally use basic math to rephrase the sentence to see it a little more clearly by using your given definition of sin. \"The system in the bible for [disobeying God]and it\\'s punishment[of going to hell], is not fair in regards to humanity.\" For you to fully understand the Bibles arguments that God is in fact being \"fair\", you must understand God\\'s attributes. There are many, but the main one is God is Holy. Many Christians surprisingly don\\'t even know what this means! The bible says God is \"Holy, holy, holy\" (Revelation 4:8), it\\'s saying that He is separated, separated, separated (Old Hebrew language would repeat something that is important rather than modern English using BOLD or exclamations) which is referring to God being so very separated from the world, people, evil and sin that it is not even funny. Again not by choice, it\\'s just what he is. So when Adam and Eve disobeyed God\\'s commandment of not eating from the tree of good and evil, they chose to disobey God\\'s commandment and because they had knowledge like God ABOUT sin, unlike God, they had freewill to act upon that knowledge. And again God is Holy and sin has no part in God or his actions whatsoever, God simply has knowledge of it just like Satan told Eve. The end result is a disobedience woman and man who passing their \"corruption\" to their descendants \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" -1 Corinthians 15:50 THEN ENTERS MY NICE FLOW INTO YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT... 2. \"Sins of our Fathers\" \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" Psalms 51:5 - To be absolutely clear, their is nothing in the bible that says God has ever or will ever give a death sentence to a baby whose (according to your example) parents are terrible role models when it comes to following God. \"I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of THOSE WHO HATE ME, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those WHO LOVE ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS.\" Without going into a lot of detail, there is nowhere here that says God will kill or send to hell the sons of sinful parents. You\\'d have to reach petty far to get it there. Deuteronomy 24:16 says, \"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.\" Lastly your remark about us being \"moral\" is also ignorance because according to the rules the Bible is true, so if I were to take that and rephrase your remark it would read... \"We as [Sinful, disobedient people] do not in good moral conscience blame the [psalms 51:5] for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give [psalms 51:5] death sentences because the father murdered.\" <---- How can immoral sinful people have a good moral conscious? I\\'m just trying to follow your Rule about the Bible being true! \"And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity.\" <------ I agree and God does too! 3. Those \"undeserving\" of Hell. -For the sake of readers getting bored I will correct some Biblical areas as per your rule, as to bring about a quick non-biased approach from the reader: \"In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not [ask for] forgiveness goes to Hell.\" \"This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven.\" Not so my friend according to the Bible which is true for the sake of this debate \"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 10:4 \"P1:God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood [Noah is called a Preacher of Righteousness - 2 Peter 2:5], Sodom and Gomorrah [Genesis 18:16-33 says that Abraham pleaded for the safety of Sodom]\"the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all [were killed] thanks to God\\'s actions [I don\\'t get this, so if an executioner, in your words \"morally\" executes a killer then the executioner is wrong?]. \"It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture.\" <-----This is actually very surprisingly biblical. Psalm 115:3 says \"But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.\" and 1 Samuel 2:6 says \"The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.\" \"P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system.\" <---- I just have to ask, who are these so called \"good\" people your are referring to specifically? \"P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. <---- This is simply not founded in any scripture although Israel is God\\'s chosen people God even wanted to wipe out Israel at one point [Numbers 14:11-19]. \"According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity.\"<----please refer to previous C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents DOES IN FACT present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment. I hope I\\'ve been fair in my rebuttal.', 'Ah. I did not intend to pull a \"fast one\" on you, but it\\'s hard to phrase the \"rules\" correctly in the start. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. -Now first off I was not making the argument that a child is not sinful from birth, or that bible does not state so. What I was saying is that the punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child. -This cuts back to the \"sins of our father\" point. We are all paying for the sins of Adam in general, but there are examples of where god commits genocide for the sins of the adult population. ================== [2.] Oh boy. Yeah Job is one of the few examples I would never, EVER use in reference to his \"knowledge\" of the Lord or his morality. Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals all his wealth. Then proceeds to hurt Job personally with illness. All this time Job is begging for an answer, asking what he did wrong, what he did to deserve this(talking to his friends). Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN(you know, the most evil entity ever). At the end, God shows up and instead of explaining to Job why all this has happened to him, he goes on a rhetorical speech asking him \"where you there when the earth was born?\" -Then God proceeds to replace that which Job had lost, but not in originality. God replaces everything by quantity. [The story of Job shows entirely that God punishes unfairly and to those undeserving.] God effectively murdered innocent people to prove a point to Satan. That\\'s probably the worse example you could have given for your argument. ================ [3.] \"How is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God?\" 1. I am not obligating god. I am merely stating that by human standards, what god did and the system he created was/is not fair. 2. Again, not everyone was \"constantly sinning\". We have no proof that all of mankind(even the children) were committing outrageous acts against God for the story of Noah, or that the slave/Egyptian children sinned so heavily, or that any of these acts of complete genocide were Justified. This is another problem with the system and it\\'s fairness, God does not state what sin or what acts lead to the genocide of these people. 3. Nor do we have any proof that God\\'s law was known to them. (btw: Romans-1 says this for the believers in the sense that \"god was all around them\" in the argument for his existence. Not his Law.). -No proof that God came to them as he did Moses. -No proof that God\\'s law is available to everyone in a way they can comprehend it. -No proof that Jesus has shown himself to everyone either.(for the argument of after). The point is that you are assuming that these people had full knowledge of their actions, the consequences, and the system God presented. The bible never mentions this, nor does reality support it. Even now you can easily prove that God does not present his system to everyone. [Note]: I get that we are arguing with the bible = true rule,but when it aligns with modern reality I think this has relevance. 4. Unintentional Sin is again, for the believers of the religion. Those who could not know of the religion could not know of the concept of Sin, be it unintentional or otherwise. ============= [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. [NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others. Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human? That\\'s taking it a bit too far. --------------- C: God\\'s \"right\" MkII No. Creation of something does not imply ownership, especially when free-will and sentience are concerned. Also implying that God is above morality is implying the appeal to authority fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org... Please, do not argue that because God is perfect, the system must be perfect. That is beneath you. Note: [Redundancy]: Of course god is \"void of sin\", since to sin is to disobey him. Alrighty, having fun so far and thank you for participating. Lets go to round 3!', 'I feel that any addition to the original post I made might push the debate farther than it should in terms of simplicity and a \"simple read\", although it is already very long. My response in accordance to the points brought up: 1. I\\'m not exactly sure how to go about saying this so I will try to make it as clear as possible. If you are making the point that God is seperate from humanity and that god is holy, seperated, and a different entity: I accept that as per the bible stating it.(I thought this was by default accepted once you accept the bible as tru per the opening). However, your math was off. The punishment of sinning is not only that you are sent to hell, but that God may take your life before that(and then consequently you would go to hell). I want o make this clear because to say that the only punishment God has given for sin in the bible is to to got to hell, is not true. 2. \"Sins of our fathers\". I\\'d like to address the acts that we are all born sinful and that is becaue of the original \"fall\" of Adam and Eve. Romans 5:18-19: 18 Therefore, as one trespass[b] led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness[c] leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man\\'s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man\\'s obedience the many will be made righteous. -Let us ignore the Jesus stuff for the sake of the debate. This verse states that all were condemned for the sin of Adam and Eve. The \"father\" of all mankind, made many sinners. Note: You did not respond or explain to people why God killed the several groups of people in the stories of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, where in each the entire group of people were wiped out because they were deemed \"sinful\" or \"corrupt\" in the eyes of God. -You assume that the verses stating that the child will not pay for the sins of the father prove that no child was punished in these genocides unfairly, but that assumption is false. Not only in the sense that all mankind has paid for the sins of Adam, but that these groups of people(children included) were punished for the sins of the mature members. Innocent children were punished (killed) in these acts. Note: I am not proposing that the bible is false, but that the verse was meant for a different interpretation. That being The son shall not bear the responsibility of the father according to the law.(i.e. the 613 commandments in the Old Testament). So that if a father broke the law, the son could not be punished for this. I believe this verse was intended in such a way. -God did kill children. In accordance with the story of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, all died for their sin(from birth) and the sins of their father. To think that not one child existed in these examples is rather naive, but for an example we can look towards the story of Moses: Exodus 11: 4-7: \"4. So Moses said, \"This is what the Lord says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 5 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt\"worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 7 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.\" Then you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.\" -I\\'d like to note that there are examples of where God himself killed the innocent and where he ordered the Israelites to do such. There is a difference, but I find that the overall effect the same. [On the topic of Born-Sinners] The Bible repeatedly tells us that we are born sinners thanks to adam and eve. In the first part I opened with the assumption that both parties would accept children as being \"innocent\". I make this assumption based upon the notion that children do not fully understand or comprehend the acts that they do and their consequences. I realize that this can also apply to more mature humans, but for children I think we can agree that \"innocence\" is among them to a certain age. This presents a conflicting view. We percieve children as innocent though the bible does not and from birth gives them the effective sentence of Hell, though they could not have possibly disobeyed god. This is effectively \"the sins of the father\", that father being Adam. 3. Deserving of Hell. I\\'d like to make the point that the verse you listed(1corinthians 10:4) is talking aobut the Jewish religion. I.e. the same \"spiritual drink\" and \"unto Moses\" relate to the Old Testament. Of course within the belief that Jesus was God(the trinity), those who already believed in the Jewish God(i.e. the jews), would have technically been believing in Jesus before he came to Earth. However that leaves us with John 14:6 \"6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" So the original meaning of the Corinthians verse is that the Jews would continue their religion by believing in Jesus. This does not apply to the non-jewish people before Jesus, but ot assure the Jews that Christianity is a continuation of their religion. ============================================= The whole point of 3 was that those who could not know of the Law, Jesus, or of the bible were sent to hell, regardless if they are \"Good\" by moral or even biblical standards. It is in accordance with 2, where they are punished not by something they did, but by the sin of Adam. Meaning: People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. ========================================= In response to your edits on P1-3(I\\'d rather you not since this makes it harder to read through later.) P1-3 1.Noah can be called a preacher and Abraham can plead for Sodom, but that has no effect whatsoever on the decision made by God and what it stands for. In response to your assumption that God \"morally\" executed a killer, I deny that. God committed genocide. (Genocide definition: the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.) This is entirely different from the moral justification of killing a specific person or group. The justification for genocide is non-existent. 2. The good people? The people who are for the most part good. Humanitarian, peaceful, non-violent. I\\'d presume there is a general definition of a \"good\" person we can agree on. 3. It is founded on all the scripture, in fact the entire story of the Old Testament is of the Jewish people. To clarify, I was talking of the time before Jesus. Genesis 17:7 \"7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\" ==================== Note: You did not edit the closing correctly. You left the phrase \"and punishes those undeserving of punishment\" ========= To summarize: 2.\"Sins of Our Father\" - Adam and Eve: mankind pays the price for generations because of their Sin. The are (according to the bible) the parents of all. -God also murdered select groups of people for the sins of the whole. -God did kill children(listed examples). [Children are innocent] -Yet the God has killed them in the act of Genocide. -Yet God condemns them to hell from their birth. 3. People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. P1: God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them. P2: See 3. P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell. C: The system of sin is one that punishes those undeserving of punishment and for circumstances that are beyond a person\\'s control.', 'Hi I\\'ll be on the side of \"Pro\" and will be debating on the subject of Christianity\\'s sin-and-punishment being fair to the human race as a whole. Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. The definition of Hell is: A place where the souls of mankind who enter are eternally tormented/tortured. I base this on the things god has punished for.(i.e. the forbidden fruit, going against his commands, etc.). ============================ If you wish to post something to this or against it, please do so, but I am not hoping for this to be the main topic. ============================= The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity. 1. \"Sins of our Fathers\" -This applies to the concept in Christianity known as \"our fallen world\" -This applies to God\\'s punishment of people throughout the bible for the sins of their father or great grandfather. The belief of paying for the sins or disobedience of our fathers is unfair. We as humans do not in good moral conscience blame the child for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give children death sentences because the father murdered. And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity. 2. Those undeserving of Hell. In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not acquire forgiveness goes to Hell. This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven. P1: God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all went to hell thanks to God\\'s actions. It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture. P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system. P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity. C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents does not present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment.

I\\'ll refute your case in the next round.==Case== FrameworkObservation 1: The primary purpose of punishment prima facieis retribution; rehabilitation is a secondary concern. Crimes are, after all, acts of aggression against victims where as rehabilitation is an act of restoration towards the criminal; it must thus be regarded as fundamentally unjust to put the benefits of the criminal (IE rehabilitation) above the benefits to the victim (IE compensation and retribution). As Michael Moore put it: “We are justified in punishing because and only because offenders deserve it.” Retribution needs to be valued above restoration. Observation 2: Consider only the effects that the implementation of Capital punishment has on the deserving--victims and law abiding citizens (civil socety). Observation 3: Abolish means to do away with entirely. If there\\'s one forseeable case in which Capital Punishment in needed, you negate.Observation 4: Ignore all objections the CP that address issues with the current system (can be reformed). C1: Capital Punishment deters crimeMethodology: We need to apply ceteris paribus when looking at the Death Penalty. We can\\'t compare Texas to New York, or New Jersey to Louisiana for obvious reasons; consider only the relationships between crime and capital punishment in specific places. Empirics: Westley Lowe observed that between 1991 and 1999 there was a 700% increase in the number of executions, along with a drop of 33% in the murder rate. More specifically, in Texas the resumption of executions in 1982 resulted in a 60% drop in the murder rate; within Texas, the Houston area (Harris county, where the polunsky execution unit is housed) the area with the most aggressive death penalty prosecuters reside, experienced a 72% decrease in the murder rate between \\'91-99[1]. This is significant, because it shows not only that nationwide murder decreased but as we get into areas that aggressively impost capital punishment (Texas executes more people than any other state, and Harris county more than any other county) the results are even more substantial! I could bring in more empirical evidence for this, but I don\\'t think it\\'s needed. Academics: Lowes findings on deterrence have been held true in at least three major academic studies, namely: Studies from Emory University stating that each execution prevents between three and eighteen murders. [2] A 2006 study from the University of Houston, stating that the Illinois moratorium on the Death Penalty led to 150 additional homicides [3] A University of Colorado at Denver study showing that for each execution five muders were prevented.[4]. Logic: Of course, not all of the observed decrease in the murder rate is the result of Capital punishment, but there can be little doubt that a just society and \"tough on crime\" laws discourage criminal behavior. A study from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center found that a decrease in violent crime resulted from harsher penalties[5] (specifically defined as \"Increase in, higher probability of, and longer duration of incarceration.\"). The result is you negate since the lives of vicious murderers can\\'t outweigh the lives of innocent civilians. C2: RecidivismCapital Punishment carries with it one incredible advantage, and that is that no executed murderer has ever harmed another individual again. As a matter of fact, of Death Row inmates held in 2009 over 5% committed their capital crime while in prison or on escape, and an amazing 2/3rds were previously convicted of a felony[6]. The last time Capital Punishment was abolished in the United States (1972), dozens of inmates were given sentences of life imprisonment and were later paroled, many of whom killed again, over 25 known victims are the result of these post-furman cases, along with dozens more from escaped or paroled murderers[7]. Two things must be drawn from this: 1. Laws change, parole boards change, rulings change, and people forget the past. The only way to forever ensure that a a murderer doesn\\'t strike again is to kill him. 2. An immediate abolition (as the resolution calls for) would lead to more disasters. To use Texas as an example, life without parole was not implement until late 2005, so all inmates who committed their crimes before then (the vast majority) would be eligible for Parole and one day released[8]. Affirmation leads to deaths by historical precedents. Even behind bars criminals manage to strike again. For example, Clarence Ray Allen, serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole (the likely alternative) still managed to cause the deaths of still more people: he got a paroled inmate he knew to kill one who testified against him, along with 2 completely innocent bystanders[9]. In an uncharacteristic act of justice and logic, the state of California executed this filth in 2006. He will never harm anyone again. C3: Justice.Refer back to my framework, we can only justifiably punish people because they deserve it, to deny this is absolute insanity! I will lay out two hypothetical (although not unrealistic) scenarios where the Death Penalty should surely be implemented. I have little doubt that my opponent will accuse me of making an \"appeal to emotion\" but since Justice is an emotional construct, theres little use in such an objection. One:How should our society respond to evil?Imagine a pedophile. He has fantasies about little girls, and constantly stalks them on the internet and in person. Constantly. Finally one day he snaps, and kidnaps an innocent little child, around age 6 or 7, takes her into a secluded area, pulls off her clothes, and brutally rapes her as she screams in vain for mercy and help. Finally, because he\\'s a sick and twisted animal, he smashes her head with a rock and runs away. Now, we have two options. We can send him to prison for the rest of his life. We can pay to feed, clothe, protect, entertain, and \"rehabilitate\" him for the rest of his life. We can look the little girls parents in the eye and say, yeah your innocent child had to die, but her killer gets to live off of your dime because we dont want to \"sink to his level\". Sorry. What justice is that? The parents will have to deal with the constant nightmare of knowing that somewhere that predator still lives, and can still harm others; he can potentially escape, or they could (God forbid) have to go through to biannual nightmares of his parole hearings because of a change in sentencing laws (as happened in the sickening James Moore rape/murder case[10].). At the very least they know that he will be sitting in his cell watching television and pleasuring himself on the memories of what he did to their beautiful daughter for the rest of his days, all payed for by them and their fellow law abiding tax payers. Wonderful.Or, we could hang/electrocute/shoot/euthanize/gas him and end it once and for all. It seems that anyone with any moral sense what so ever knows which option is preferable. Two: Imagine for this scenario we have a leader of a militant personality cult, convicted of rape and murder. His followers are fanatic and will fight to the death to protect him, and commit suicide on his command. In the Aff world, he\\'s imprisoned and his followers fight to get him out--they kill dozens of gaurds and lesser inmates in the process before they are all shot. In the Neg world, the man is rightfully executed and his followers commit suicide with him This might be a strange scenario, but recall that even one example where CP is needed is enough to negate. Also imagine a war criminal such as Adolf Hitler. My opponent must prove his system outweighs mine in:1. Deterrence2. Justice3. Recidivism preventionAlong with showing compelling reasons to change the status quo. Before then, the resolution is completely negated. The Death Penalty is a just consequence for those who choose a path of evil. http://www.debate.org...', 'I accept.', 'Partly my fault too, but yeah thanks for understanding, and sorry again. >.<', \"Damn it all. I'm very sorry but I won't be able to finish this debate. Very sorry for the horrible conduct.\", \"First I would like to say it is a pleasure to be debating thett3 once again on this topic. Judging from our last debate I'm sure this will be worthwhile. My arguments: Short Overview:I will be using three basic contentions to support my case. The first will show the unnecessary and major risk that will always exist with the death penalty, but does not exist with life imprisonment. The second will show the physchological societal shaping of ones personality and character traits brought about by events in ones life that leads to the fact that certain persons are not at fault for the way they turn out and thus imposing the harshest penalty against them is unjust and we must bend our efforts towards reforming these persons rather than terminating them. The third will show that capital punishment is inefficient in accomplishing the goals of the state, in that there are three main purposes for the state in taking action against law-breakers and capital punishment only performs two of those, while with life imprisonment we have the possibility of accomplishing all three. C.1 As long as the death penalty is in use, there is always the risk of killing innocents. Everyone should agree on the fact that every risk of note existing in our form of punishment aught to be diminished if possible. What about the utmost risk? The risk of the state killing innocent inhabitants of its own jurisdiction? Sadly this still exists through the use of capital punishment. Every time we send someone to their execution there is the possibility that we are sending an innocent man too his death. Why on earth should we allow these risks to take place when there is no need? For there is indeed not much need. Life imprisonment is effective and never includes the chance of killing an innocent man. Those sentenced to life imprisonment have the chance to be proven innocent before they die. Despite what advocates of the death penalty say, innocents being executed are not at all a rare accurance as evidence shows. Well over eighty people in the past quarter century have been condemned but then released before execution. [1] This source shows detailed accounts of eleven innocents being executed. [2] One researcher says he has found at least 74 cases in which wrongful executions have most likely taken place. [2] 69 inmates on death row have been released since 1973 (Source is from 1997 so it would be allot higher now).[3] This clearly shows the risks of the DP. Risks which are completely unnecessary and should be gotten rid of immediately. These men were lucky to escape with their lives. I should add that there have, undoubtedly, been cases in which innocent people have been executed but have not been proved innocent afterwards. After being executed there is not much need for someone to try too prove the innocence of someone who is already dead. So there are undoubtedly instances in the past where we have executed an innocent man but did not know so, and still do not know. With life imprisonment there is zero chance of killing an innocent man. It is a horrible thing for an innocent person to be killed at the hands of the state. It is also completely unnecessary. C.2 Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development theory [9] This theory clearly shows that the way people turn out is based much on their life events. Thus it is not entirely their fault but corrupt society's. Rather than just executing criminals we should realize that one, they are not solely at fault, and two, we have the possibility of reforming them. Now obviously the death penalty is reserved for only the most extreme crimes, and I think it is logical to believe those people who commit these crimes are just products of our corrupt society. This theory demonstrates my argument. Imposing our harshest punishment against those who are not entirely at fault is clearly unjust.Many people are dealt with less harshly due to mental disorders. This follows the same lines. C.3 Those executed cannot be be reformed, or rehabilitated. Capital punishment does not achieve maximum purpose.Why do we take action against law breakers? Punishment Segregation Rehabilitation The ideal form of state action against criminals is one that accomplishes all purposes. This is an obvious fact. Thus whatever accomplishes all three purposes most effectively we must consider superior. With the use of life imprisonment we have the chance of accomplishing all three of these. However with the use of capital punishment the third is impossible, unless they are reformed before they are executed. But it is much more likely they would be reformed if they have their whole life to be reformed. Thus it is safe to conclude life imprisonment is superior too capital punishment. The death penalty deprives criminals of a second chance which SHOULD be given to them. The question is, why would we be using a form of punishment that only accomplishes two of its three main purposes, when there is another option that may accomplish all three? Though it's not completely necessary, here are a few examples. Two murderers, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, were sentenced to life imprisonment, but latter expressed remorse at their actions.[7] If they had been sentenced to death they would never have had the chance to repent. Watson and Atkins, two other murderers, became Christian Fundamentalists after being given a life sentence.[7]With the use of the death penalty the State is not accomplishing what it is supposed too.

Here is what Christ said about Thyatira: \"Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

However, it seems that a majority of his points are new arguments rather than the rebuttals that we had agreed on for round 3. I will, though, respond to them anyway even though the arguments provided by opponent ultimately shouldn\"t be given much weight (due to their not meeting the criteria set for the round). I would also like to note, that my opponent offers no evidence for any of his arguments. [For the purposes of space, I have included only the first and last few words of some of my opponent\\'s longer arguments; the full arguments can be seen in the previous round] 1-\"[I]t\"s glorified infidelity.\" This is not the case. Infidelity is described as \"marital disloyalty; adultery.\"[1] Voluntary polygamous marriage (VPM) certainly does not meet the prior criterion; one partner is never being disloyal to a married partner by being with another married partner of the same marriage; it is the same marriage. The second criterion should probably be defined in its own right. Adultery is \"voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than his or her lawful spouse.\"[2] So, VPM also fails to meet the second criterion of infidelity because a partner would be having sex with someone who is his or her lawful spouse. 2-\"It would be difficult for the government to tax.\" Taxation is already a difficult process, but I suppose my opponent is suggesting that VPM would make taxation even more difficult. I agree that this would likely be the case, but I would also point out that this is merely because it is currently a practice that is not recognized by the state. Marriage reform tends to necessitate tax reform. Introducing either interracial marriage or same-sex marriage into a system that criminalized and discriminated against them would likely force some kind of marriage-related tax reform. My opponent\"s argument here can only be taken seriously if s/he also discourages interracial and same-sex marriage. 3-\"Relationships should be between two people.\" This is entirely without grounding or warrant. To use an earlier example, it could be just as easy to say \"relationships should be between two people of the same race\" or \"relationships should be between people of different sexes.\" Merely stating these things is not a good reason to criminalize interracial or same-sex marriage. 4-\"Couples have to... there\"s multiple people.\" Following my opponent\"s logic here would yield disastrous results. For example, families also have to make decisions and compromises together. It is harder to agree when there are more people. Having children increases the number of people in a family. Therefore, people should not have children. Of course, if everybody did this, it would result in human extinction. 5-\"Polygamous relationships can... is already overpopulated.\" Actually, because the female reproductive system can only create a single child at a time (discounting multiple births), any form of polygamy could not increase the population more than monogyny could (assuming a roughly equal proportion of men and women in the world). 6-\"Polygamy is almost... being owned by men.\" Remember, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. If the woman\"s act is not voluntary, then it is not relevant to this debate. 7-\"Marriage is a... a cattle drive.\" A VPM can also be a partnership and a relationship; it is simply between more people. 8-\"Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women.\" This is true. I fail to see how this is necessarily disadvantageous. 9-\"Most people agree... to older men.\" Again, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. Joel Feinberg classifies the choice of a child as \"substantially nonvoluntary.\"[3] I think many people would agree. 10-\"Spouses can have... it creates tension.\" This is true. Marriage is difficult, but I fail to see how this justifies laws against VPM. 11-\"The established needs... around the house.\" My opponent has offered no evidence to support this. Even if s/he had, it would not provide a convincing justification for laws against VPM. 12-\"In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status.\" This seems unlikely, especially when you consider that there are societies in which polyandry is the predominant form of polygamy.[4] Even if this were the case, my opponent would also have to show that polygamy is the cause of this lower in each of these cultures for this argument to have much weight. 13-\"True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people.\" Even if this were the case, it is not a good justification for laws against VPM because \"true love\" is not a prerequisite for marriage. 14-\"Most North American... or food stamps.\" That is unfortunate, but unless my opponent is suggesting that VPM is the cause of this, the argument does not hold much weight. If s/he is suggesting that VPM is the cause, then the argument seems to be guilty of a cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 15-\"Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices.\" I agree. 16-\"Legalizing polygamy would... on women\"s rights.\" This is completely unwarranted; I could just as easily say \"legalizing VPM would not give more power to religions and would not infringe on women\"s rights.\" Also, in terms of women\"s rights, I would also like to remind my opponent that the resolution deals with VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage and that a woman has just as much right to marry multiple men. 17-\"Legal polygamy would... to such marriages.\" My opponent assumes that nations are obligated to grant citizenship to immigrants merely because they are married to a citizen of that nation. However, my opponent offered no reason for us to accept this assumption. Some final notes: I-While my opponent offered a larger number of arguments, a multitude of arguments should not be confused for acumen. II-Though I have argued against my opponent\"s new arguments, s/he offered them in a round dedicated to rebuttals, and because of this, I was given far less opportunity to rebut them. III-My opponent did not refute my initial arguments. This is incredibly important because it means that my final syllogism, which firmly negates the resolution, stands. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Also, any new arguments against this portion of my initial argument would be incredibly unfair to the spirit of this debate as I am now completing my final round and would be unable to respond to them. So, ultimately, my syllogism has been unrefuted and its ultimate conclusion that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just must stand. Finally, I would like to thank my opponent for his or her participation in this debate. Sources: [1] http://dictionary.reference.com... [2] http://dictionary.reference.com...

(Pg. 81)', 'It is unfortunate that my opponent was unable to respond to my arguments, so I will try to make my arguments this round briefer. I would first like to address my definition of polygamy, which has gone unrefuted. Talbott\"s definition of legal paternalism is \"the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard).[1] This definition is important because it supports the first premise of my syllogism in C3. Next, my argument in C1 went unrefuted as well. This Millian argument showed that a certain type of legal paternalism (strong/hard) is not just. This argument is significant because it proves the second premise of my syllogism in C3. My opponent also failed to refute my argument in C2. This showed that laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism because they fail to meet the criteria of such forms of paternalism. This argument is important because it supports the third premise of my syllogism in C3. Finally, with all of the premises of my syllogism warranted, my conclusion (that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just) necessarily follows. As a reminder, the following is the syllogism to which I am referring. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) I have already supported 1-3. 4 follows from a disjunctive syllogism of premises 1 and 3. Because laws against polygamy are a type of paternalism, which is either strong/hard or weak soft and laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not weak/soft, they must be strong/hard. 5, which disproves the resolution, necessarily follows because of the rules of identity on 2 and 4. Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism, strong/hard paternalism is not just; thus, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. This relies on the same reasoning that tells us that when A=B and B=C that A=C. [1] Talbott, William. \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism.\" Which Rights Should Be Universal? Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print. (Pg. 53)', 'As far as I can tell, the only mention of polygamy in debates here so far have been in passing, so I hope everyone can enjoy looking at it a little bit closer. With debates concerning same-sex marriage currently taking over cable news channels, quite a bit has been said about \"the sanctity of marriage. \" People have questioned whether marriage should only be between one man and one woman or if it can also extend to one man and another man or one woman and another woman. While a great amount can be said about this subject, I turn my attention instead to a single word used in the rhetoric; that word is \"one. \" It seems that whether groups are advocating same-sex marriage or rejecting it, they believe that marriage is a commitment between one person and one other person only. On some level, this reflects the anti-polygamy sentiment of modern society. In fact, Edward Stein states \"that polygamy has never been legal in any [U. S. ] state. \" He adds that the U. S. Supreme Court \"effectively denied that there is a right to marry more than one person at the same time\" in Reynolds v. United States. [1] In this debate, I will argue that is no just basis for laws against voluntary polygamous marriage. Before progressing any further, it would be beneficial to actually define polygamy. Generally, polygamy can be defined as marriage between more than two partners. Alan S. Miller and Satoshi Kanazawa note that polygamy is often confused with polygyny. They add that \"polygyny is the marriage of one man to more than one woman. \" On the other hand, polygamy can also include polyandry, \"the marriage of one woman to more than one man. \"[2] It should be mentioned that both polygyny and polyandry require that the relationship be heterosexual; I will not give much consideration to homosexual polyamory in this debate because doing so would require even more complex distinctions than those already made and does not even meet the technical definition of polygamy. Additionally, I would no like to define an important term in my arguments, which is legal paternalism. In \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism,\" William Talbott explains that \"[a] law is paternalistic if it is enacted to promote the good of the target audience by overruling their own judgment about what is good for them. \" He adds that \"[l]egal paternalism is the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard). [3] C1-I would like to first explore why some kinds of paternalism (strong/hard) can be considered unjust. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill makes a convincing argument against legal paternalism being just. Mill claims that \"neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. \" He explains that this is because \"[h]e is the person most interested in his own well-being, the interest which any other person… can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has\" and \"with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by anyone else. \"[4] So, Mill suggests that a fully-capable adult is the most reliable judges on what is good for her because no other person is as interested in that person\\'s good as she is. Of course, this means that other people as well as governments are less reliable judges. Thus, legal paternalism is generally not justified. Mill does provide some exceptions to this; such exceptions are weak/soft paternalism. C2-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage do not meet the standards of either major theory of weak/soft paternalism. A-They do not meet Mill\\'s standards. In fact, Mill directly addresses polygamy. He explains that the particular Mormon belief \"which is the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy. \"[5]. Mill admits that he strongly disapproves of the practice, but he concludes that polygamy should not be prohibited. He notes \"that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a wife at all. \"[6] Whether or not the latter claim here represents an outdated worldview, the prior is certainly still relevant today. B-They do not meet Joel Feinberg\\'s standards. In \"Legal Paternalism,\" Feinberg describes a weak form of paternalism. According to Feinberg, \"the state has the right to prevent self-regarding harmful conduct when but only when it is substantially nonvoluntary or when temporary intervention is necessary to establish whether it is voluntary or not. \"[7] Such an intervention is certainly paternalistic, but it is a weak form of paternalism and, as such, is justifiable. Feinberg describes a voluntary act as one that \"represent[s] the agent faithfully in some important way… [and] express[es] his or her settled values and preferences. \"[8] If the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed about the particular circumstances of his or action, that action would not be considered voluntary. So, another person would be justified in preventing the agent from acting if that person believed the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed. However, such an intervener would be justified in intervening long enough to establish whether the agent\\'s action is voluntary or not. Of course, the resolution deals with voluntary polygamous marriage, so laws against it certainly are not weak/soft. In Harm to Self, Feinberg addresses polygamy more directly. He asserts that \"there are no convincing liberal reasons for the\" prohibition of polygamy. Feinberg then makes the slightly stronger claim \"that there should be no such crime [against polygamy] at all\". [9] This seems consistent with his account from \"Legal Paternalism. \" If an act is clearly voluntary, then paternalistic intervention is not justified. C3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. To prove this, I offer the following syllogism based on my arguments so far. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Sources: [1] Stein, Edward. \"Past and Present Proposed Amendments to the United States Constitution Regarding Marriage. \" Washington University Law Quarterly 82.3 (2004): 611-685.

It would be difficult for the government to tax. Relationships should be between two people. Couples have to make decisions and compromises together, and it’s harder to agree when there’s multiple people. Polygamous relationships can end up with too many children. The world is already overpopulated. Polygamy is almost never polyandry. It’s not about women’s freedom to choose who they marry or how many spouses they have- it’s about women being owned by men. Marriage is a partnership and a relationship. Polygamy turns marriage into a cattle drive. Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women. Most people agree that countries that practice polygamy live in an oppressive, abusive society with fanatical, religious men- especially when they marry young girls to older men. Spouses can have animosity, jealousy, etc towards other the other spouses and it creates tension. The established needs are impossible to meet in a polygamist marriage. These needs include- ongoing affection/attention, conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and help around the house. In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status. True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people. Most North American “families” in polygamous situations are on welfare or food stamps. Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices. Legalizing polygamy would give more power to religions, and would infringe on women’s rights. Legal polygamy would turn immigration into a nightmare. An immigrant can claim to be wed to half a nation of women and demand that all these women be brought to, say, the US. Polygamists can arrive at the border and demand refugee status because of persecution. Sorting out these claims would be impossible, since most nations refuse to give legal status to such marriages.', 'I accept.One thing though.Just: guided by truth, reason, justice, and fairness.[1]Polygamy: the practice or condition of having more than one spouse,especially wife, at one time.[2]Sources:[1] http://dictionary.reference.com...[2] http://dictionary.reference.com...;', 'I did not check every state\\'s laws for everything. I searched three reliable sites for \"States that have laws against girls playing American Football\", and I did not find anything against them playing football. The biggest thing against women playing football was that they should find a different sport to play. Others call it \"Abusive\" for a woman to play football. However, I do not find this t obe abusive, and if it happened to be abusive, you could not blame coaches, teamates, or the opposing team, you blame her for getting into this game. This was a very fine debate. Thank you for your time, and good luck.', 'Reading the laws of other states, there is no law that says something like 7B: Women can\\'t play football with men. There are absolutely no laws in other states that say that women can\\'t play football. With my football experience, I have seen girls playing the sport. You know too,we played Atrisco Valley, and that girl who played as well, if not better, than some of the boys we have seen playing. Also, I have seen in a few, but not all of the High Schools have at least one girl playing for their team.There is one girl division The Augusta National division, which is for girls. Also, with some research I have found that there are girl football divisions in Germany. Not the \"soccer\" type football, as they call it in England, but actual American-type football. So yes, there are girl divisions for American football.', \"Many people say that women can not play football. However, I have found that when they say this, they say women are weak. Women are not given the chance to try football past the Young American Football League (YAFL). But if men think women can't play because of politics, they are not familiar with the laws. You can not put anybody under you, all men are created equal. he only league that prohibits women from completely playing is the NFL. So yes, girls have all the right to play outside the NFL.\", \"First of all, Did you read the Youth Football rules for all 49 other states? Also, as the age increase for players, so does the competitiveness among players. When you have read the NMAA rules for High School football then you can rebuke me, but until then your argument on youth rules is invalid. YAFL allows females to play because, although we are competitive, we will not intentionally hurt them unless a player is a sociopath. I'm not doubting a women;s ability to play football I'm just saying that they would be a distraction and would not all be able to play the amount of required playing time. Don't get me wrong, omen can play but very few have the stamina and concentration to compete at the high school level. Let me ask you something, specifically what playing level are we talking about? you started with Professional but then we moved to high school and YAFL. There is another youth football league on the East Coast ( POP WARNER ) that encourages women play the good sport of football, but like I said before there is no platform for women's professional football anywhere in our country.... BTW Augusta National Division is NCAA not pro. thank you.\", 'Your argument id valid, however there is no other professional level of football in America other than the NFL (National Football League ) and the Arena Football League ( NOT sure on actual name ) which also prohibits women from playing. some states may vary on rules, but in New Mexico women are prohibited from playing football with men ( due to age and other variables), and there isnt enough interested women in football to create a whole division just for women.

In sports, winning is the endgame. players win so they can win so men can buy beer and congratulate each other for sitting in front of a TV, cheering on athletes... who provide meaningless entertainment that artificially heightens emotion. I can\\'t think of anything lower.

For example, the \"judgements\" in dance are subjective, and up to each individual to decide. There is basic technique, but there is also room for artistic interpretation. The main difference however, is the storytelling aspect of dance. Dance exists to tell a story through movement and music. That is something sports simply do not do. Yes, they are both physically demanding, but dance requires an acting ability and a storytelling aspect that is simply not present in sports.', 'Refutations\"Women are not equally represented in Government\" My opponent has not explained why a disconnect between the percentage of women in the population and the percentage of women in government positions matters.

My opponent has not proven that the changes this \"issue\" would need to stop existing are viable. For example, I listed five papers in my second round showing a strong correlation between increased female representation on corporate boards and decline in corporate performance. \"Women in the US before Obamacare were denied basic health services in their insurance such as birth control because it violated other peoples beliefs\" My opponent is not talking about something that is currently an issue.

My opponent doesn\\'t recognize that his source thinkprogress.org never clarifies how it controls by occupation, leading to ambiguity and a lot of reasonable doubt considering the paper reviewing over 50 peer-reviewed papers and concluding there is no pay gap, and the studies and analysis I\\'ve linked to before showing there is no gender bias in STEM. \"Women are significantly less likely to be extremely wealthy\" My opponent does not give any explanation as to why this is caused by discrimination. My opponent does not mention the fact that men make up around three quarters of the homeless (http://usich.gov...). \"Despite Quotas in Britain women are still not equally represented in government\" My opponent has not explained why a disconnect between the percentage of women in the population and the percentage of women in government positions matters. As long as you vote for them, their Gender, Race, etc. shouldn\\'t matter. My opponent has not proven that the cause of this is discrimination. My opponent has not proven that the changes this \"issue\" would need to stop existing are viable. For example, I listed five papers in my second round showing a strong correlation between increased female representation on corporate boards and decline in corporate performance. Thank you.', '1. Domestic Violencea) Male victims [Richard L. Davis, 2009 Journal] Men are more likely than women to die as a result of domestic violence [1]. [Janet Bloomfield, 2013 Article; National Surveys from Centre for Disease Control & Department of Justice] More men than women are victims of intimate partner violence [2]. b) Female instigators [Martin Fiebert Ph.D., June 2013 study] Women are equally or more aggressive than men in relationships [3]. [Dr. Elizabeth Bates, July 2014 study] Women are significantly more likely to be physically aggressive [4]. c) Shelters [Mankind Initiative] In the United Kingdom, there are 180x the amount of Domestic violence shelters for Heterosexual women than for heterosexual men [5]. 2. Quotasa) Legitimacy [Wendy M. Williams & Stephen Ceci, Cornell University professors at the Department of Human Development 2014 study] There\\'s no evidence that the supposed \"glass ceiling\" keeps women out of high-up STEM jobs. The evidence [6] shows that, as articulated in this video by the American Enterprise Institute [7],: Ph.D. women are as likely as their male counterparts to be invited to interview for tenure track jobsPh.D. women are as likely as their male counterparts to be offered that jobPh.D. women receive comparable salaries to their male counterpartsPh.D. women receive similar levels of funding to their male counterpartsPh.D. women express similar levels of satisfaction to their male counterparts Explanations for why there aren\\'t as many women in some fields is they\\'re not interested, however other factors are that male graduates value their earnings over their personal satifsfaction with the job [8]. b) Effect on performanceThe academic concensus on attempts to increase Gender diversity\\'s effect on corporate performance is a negative correlation. The organization C4MB (Campaign for Merit in Business) has collected five reports, all concluding that increased female representation leads to performance decline [9]: Professor Kenneth R. Ahern (University of Southern California) & Professor Amy K. Dittmar (University of Michigan), 2011 paper Professor Oyving Bohern (Norwegian School of Management) & Professor R Oystein Strom (Oslo and Akershus University College), 2010 paper Professor David A Matsa (Northwestern University, Kellogg School of Management) & Professor Amalia R Miller (University of Virginia, 2011 paper Professor David Ferreira (London School of Economics) & Renee B. Adams (University of New South Wales), 2008 paper Professor Alan N. Berger (University of South Carolina, Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Tilburg University), Thomas Kick (Deutsche Bundesbank), Professor Klaus Schaek (Bangor University); studies done 1994-2010, paper published 2012 c) PopularityQuotas discriminate against men who are more suitable for a job just because they\\'re men. But they receive support in Britain from: David Cameron\\'s Conservative Party (Despite it being a mostly broken promise) [10] Ed Miliband\\'s Labour Party [11] Nick Clegg\\'s Lib Dems [12] Natalie Bennett\\'s Green Party [13] 3. Views of Gender in societya) Standards [Amy W.Y. Yeung, 2012 report] Men who treat women the same way they treat men are seen as sexist by both men and women [14]. b) \"Women are wonderful\" effect [Alice H. Eagly, Antonio Mladinic, Stacey Otto, 1990 article] The \"Women are wonderful\" effect is a phenomena found through psychological research finding that even negatives qualities more common in women, such as aggression (see earlier source), are associated with women less than they are with men [15]. c) Women\\'s view on men [DM, 2013] Research shows that women think that men are good for \"nothing\" [16]. 4. Crimea) Sentence Disparity [David B. Mustard, University of Georgia, April 2001 report] For the same crime under similar circumstances, the average sentence for a man is 51.5 months, whereas for a woman it\\'s 18.5 months [17]. [DM, 2010 article] Judges in Britain have been ordered to show more mercy on women criminals [18]. 5. Educationa) Bias [19-University of Helsinki, 2011 report + 20-Christopher M. Cromwell, 2012 report] Female teachers are more biased than male teachers, female teachers disproportionately treat boys worse and give them lower grades [19,20]. 6. Feminist Bias in Academiaa) Non-feminist Domestic Violence studies [Murray A. Strauss, Ph.D., 2010 report] There are seven ways listed by Murray A. Strauss in his 2010 report in which non-feminist DV reports are censored [21]: \"Concealing the evidence\" \"Avoid Obtaining evidence on Female penetration\" \"Selective Citation of research\" \"Stage Conclusions that Contradict the Data\" \"Block publication of Articles that have information feminists don\\'t like\" \"Prevent funding of Research\" \"Harass, Threaten, or Punish people who publish information feminists don\\'t like\" ex. of Censorship: [Fox News, 2006 article] \"Feminists Deny Truth on Domestic Violence\" [22] ex. of Concealing the evidence: [Greg Anderson, 2014 article] \"Domestic Violence study suspended by UNSW for break of ethics\" [23] ex. of Preventing funding: [U.S. Department of Justice, 2006 report] -- \"U.S. Department of Justice refuses to fund #VAWA studies focusing on violence against men\" [24] b) Non-feminist IQ tests [25-Helmuth Nyborg, 2003 paper+26-Helmuth Nyborg, 2005 paper] Since the late 1980s, the standard IQ test has been altered to purposefully close the natural 8.25-point advantage that adult males have over adult females [25,26]. c) Feminist Factoids in politics Barack Obama, thought to be the most powerful man in the world, infamously repeats popular feminist lies, such as the 23% pay gap based on \"discrimination\" [27]. In reality, even reports suggesting a 6.6% gap [28] have had errors pointed out in them. Academic Christina Hoff Sommers [29] writes: \"Economics majors (66 percent male) have a median income of $70,000; for sociology majors (68 percent female) it is $40,000. Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute has pointed to similar incongruities. The AAUW study classifies jobs as diverse as librarian, lawyer, professional athlete, and \"media occupations\" under a single rubric--\"other white collar.\" \"One report from the U.S. Dept. of Labor shows that the pay gap is \"almost entirely\" due to individual choices, and not discrimination [30]. d) Bias in Wikipedia [The Guardian, 2015] Wikipedia were recently forced to ban 5 editors fron Gender-related articles [31]. 7. Paternitya) Child Custody Related to general court bias against men, Men lose 84% of child custody cases [32]. b) Fatherlessness [Kristina Hansen, 2013] \"Study links aggressive boys to Mom\\'s behaviour\" [33] Fatherlessness increases young boys\\' susceptibility to developing hypermasculine traits [34] 2013 Study: Fatherlessness children suffer neurobiological deficits [35] Sources1 http://www.emeraldinsight.com...2 http://www.avoiceformen.com...3 https://j4mb.files.wordpress.com...4 https://www.nationalparentsorganization.org...5 http://j4mb.wordpress.com...6 http://www.psychologicalscience.org...7 8 http://www.telegraph.co.uk...9 https://c4mb.files.wordpress.com...10 http://www.telegraph.co.uk...11 http://www.theguardian.com...12 http://www.itv.com...13 http://www.greenparty.org.uk...14 https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca...15 http://pwq.sagepub.com...16 http://www.dailymail.co.uk...17 http://people.terry.uga.edu...18 http://www.dailymail.co.uk...19 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...20 http://people.terry.uga.edu...21 http://pubpages.unh.edu...22 http://www.foxnews.com...23 http://www.familylawexpress.com.au...24 http://www.reddit.com...25 http://www.amazon.com...26 http://www.sciencedirect.com...27 28 http://www.aauw.org...29 http://www.huffingtonpost.com...30 http://www.consad.com...31 http://www.theguardian.com...32 http://www.census.gov...33 http://www.avoiceformen.com...34 https://books.google.co.uk...35 http://www.avoiceformen.com...', \"Hello, I am Jacob Gibbs.Resolution: Talking only about issues directly affecting the social equality (or lack of) in developed Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America, Men's rights are more of an issue than Women's rights.DefinitionsMen's rights: Issues in which social inequality is a result of decisions/choices, whether consciously or subconsciously, motivated by a hatred, or discrimination against, men.Women's rights: Issues in which social inequality is a result of decisions/choices, whether consciously or subconsciously, motivated by a hatred, or discrimination against, women.(+ for the purpose of the debate, Social (in/)equality relates to (in/)equality of opportunity, not (in/)equality of outcomeRules1.

Sorry I can not continue this but know that I argue this as a man who thinks its frankly dangerous to assume the fight for female equality is over\", \"One of Barack Obama's main rallying cries is that Washington is broken, that John McCain and Hillary Clinton have been part of the problem, not the solution. But the only thing Obama will do is expand Washington's power and control like WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN OUR 200+ YEARS AS A COUNTRY (with exception to the New Deal, from the socialist democrat darling FDR). Through nationalized health care, increasing taxes, environmental protectionism, business and corporate regulation, and more bureaucracy, Obama's future plan for Washington makes no sense at all with his original claim. If Washington is the problem and we need change, expanding Washington's power and control is the exact opposite solution that we need. His stance makes no sense and is completely irrational.\", '\"Okay, so let\\'s stop taxing companies. Then our government will be even more broken, because it won\\'t be able to pay for anything. Good idea.\" I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms. It is the upper class that runs the businesses that the lower class works. \"And I guarantee you they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes.\" Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \"Taxing to pay for government programs isn\\'t Marxist. And guess waht? The government has the right, BY THE CONSTITUTUION, to tax.\" Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. And for taxes (from the Wall Street Journal): \"Mr. Obama has recently veered sharply left. He now proposes to solve the looming Social Security shortfall exclusively with higher taxes. …Currently, all wages below about $100,000 are subject to a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax. But all wages above that amount are not subject to the tax. Mr. Obama wants to eliminate the cap, but, in a concession to taxpayers, exempt wages between $100,000 and $200,000. …Mr. Obama\\'s plan would keep Social Security in the black for only three additional years. Under his proposal, annual deficits would hit in 2020, instead of 2017. By the 2030s the system would still run an annual deficit exceeding $150 billion. Mr. Obama\\'s modest improvements to Social Security\\'s financing come at a steep cost. …The top marginal federal tax rates would effectively increase to 50.3% from 37.9%, equivalent to repealing the Bush income tax cuts almost three times over. If one accounts for behavioral responses, even the modest budgetary improvements from Mr. Obama\\'s plan are likely to be overstated. If employers reduce wages to cover their increased payroll-tax liabilities, these wages would no longer be subject to state or federal income taxes, or Medicare taxes. A 2006 study by Harvard economist and Obama adviser Jeffrey Liebman concluded that roughly 20% of revenue increases from raising the tax cap would be offset by declining non-Social Security taxes. Assuming modest negative behavioral responses, Mr. Liebman projected an additional 30% reduction in net revenues, leaving barely half the intended revenue intact. Mr. Obama\\'s plan would also dramatically raise incentives for tax evasion, further degrading revenue gains. Many high-earning individuals evade the Medicare payroll tax by setting up \"S Corporations,\" paying themselves in untaxed dividends rather than taxable wages. John Edwards avoided $590,000 in Medicare taxes this way in the 1990s. …The U.S. already collects far more Social Security taxes from high earners than other countries do. Social Security taxes here are currently capped at about three times the national average wage — far above other developed countries. In Canada and France payroll taxes are levied only up to the average wage. In the United Kingdom, taxes stop at 1.15 times the average wage; in Germany and Japan at 1.5 times.\" Barack Obama is a radical leftist.', '\"This fallacy is that the only possible way to fix governmental problems is to limit the government. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems.\" I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem. His solution is to expand Washington like we\\'ve never seen. How does his position make any sense? \"On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people.\" Since when was it the government\\'s responsibility to provide health care for its people? It is no where in the Constitution. Health care is not a right. And dont even get me started on the expenses of national healthcare for 300,000,000 people. \"On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational. The government is \"broken\" here because it is inefficient in protecting the environment. Obama wants to change that.\" a) global warming is a crock of sh**. b) carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Even if you believe in global warming hysteria, the percentage of pollution caused from CO2 (businesses) is minimal. Putting the environment as a priority of the economy is mentally insane. Obama wants to tax carbon emissions from the corporate and business sector which would seriously cripple and hurt our economy. It would be a complete disaster. This is the liberal agenda...ideology over common sense. \"On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot... The government is \"broken\" here because it fails to keep these companies in line.\" Hmm, do you know why companies are outsourcing? MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE IDIOT CONGRESSMAN (ALMOST ENTIRELY LIBERALS AND A FEW FAKE REPUBLICANS) WHO TAX THE HELL OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. How do liberals not get it? Do you see what\\'s happening in California? Companies are moving out of CA like wildfire because the legislature in the golden state is taxing the hell of them. Companies are moving to Nevada and Arizona, and California\\'s economy is beginning to suffer. \"On taxes, Obama wants to repeal certain tax cuts on the upper classes in order to pay for these programs.\" Where in the Constitution does it talk about wealth redistribution? This is a tactic right out of the Marxist playbook. Why are liberals so fond of socialism? Have they not learned from history? \"Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational.\" Ya thats a brilliant idea. Let\\'s raise taxes (at a rate we\\'ve never seen in our lives) during a time in our country where our economy is in a recession and our consumer confidence level is at a 26 year low. THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL. How does raising taxes during an economic crisis make any sense whatsoever?', 'First, I\\'d like to point out that my opponent has dropped every point but the point about taxes. So, I will only be focusing on this in the final round, and you can assume that the CON won those points, since he obviously has no response. Right here, since he didn\\'t flow thorugh with the other issues, I should win on a basic cost-benefit analysis. But I\\'ll show you why he\\'s wrong about taxes before letting you get to the vote. \"I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms. It is the upper class that runs the businesses that the lower class works. \" Supply-side economics are no guarantee. You also brought up that taxing more is bad because of the recession. BUt, individuals (both people and companies) tend to spend less during recessions, which only makes matters worse. So, if we get more money to the government for programs so they can SPEND THAT MONEY, it actually helps the problems of the recession. You see, the government is pretty much guaranteed to spend that money. So, it\\'s not making the recession worse at all to tax. \"Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \" You just contradicted yourself. You said that they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes, and then you say taht they outsource because of taxes. Which is it? The fact of the matter is, you\\'re blaming outsourcing on overtaxing (when you haven\\'t even given numbers as to this overtaxing), when they\\'ll do it either way. Things like this are why Obama wants some regulation. \"Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. \" And you missed the point of my original argument. It\\'s not a redistribution of wealth. It\\'s taxing so we can pay for government programs. That\\'s basic. And I\\'m glad that you brought up that Wall Street Journal article, because you obviously didn\\'t read it. It\\'s just paraphrased. Actually, you didn\\'t even paraphrase it, did you? No. You took the paraphrasing from Cato at Liberty, which is the blog of the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think-tank. Here\\'s the page you got it from: . http://www.cato-at-liberty.org... So. .. You\\'re basically taking something out of context that a BIASED THINK TANK took out of context. Here\\'s the real article is: . http://online.wsj.com... It\\'s of course talking about his plan to deal with social security. This is my favorite part: \"His proposal would be a very large tax hike, yet it won\\'t be enough. \" It continues: \"Mr. Obama\\'s plan fixes less than half of Social Security\\'s long-term deficit, making further tax increases inevitable. The Policy Simulation Group\\'s Gemini model estimates that Mr. Obama\\'s proposal, if phased as Mr. Obama suggests, would solve only part of the problem. A 10 year phase-in, for example, would address only 43% of Social Security\\'s 75-year shortfall. And this is assuming that Congress would save the surplus from the tax increases -- almost $600 billion over 10 years -- rather than spending it, as Congress does now. \" I\\'ll let you read the rest of it for yourself. So, you see, the problem isn\\'t that the taxes are messing things up, as you\\'re trying to imply. In fact, the problem is that the taxes aren\\'t enough! If anything, it would require more taxes! Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent only has the point of taxes left going into Round Four, and this doesn\\'t even flow through. He used his sources out of context and wrong, when in fact they supported a point contrary to what he was trying to get across. Even if you want to accept a few of his points, even if you think that Obama isn\\'t the right choice for president, he has, in no way, proven that Obama is irrational.', 'Oh, and just watch the straw man burn... \"I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem. His solution is to expand Washington like we\\'ve never seen. How does his position make any sense?\" No. He\\'s saying that Washington has problems. He\\'s suggesting ways to fix these problems. There are multiple ways to fix these problems, and Obama\\'s plan is one. It\\'s not irrational. In fact, it\\'s very rationally founded. \"Since when was it the government\\'s responsibility to provide health care for its people? It is no where in the Constitution. Health care is not a right. And don\\'t even get me started on the expenses of national healthcare for 300,000,000 people.\" I never said it was in the Constitution. I never said it was a responsibility. I never said that it was a right. And Obama\\'s plan is to get every American on one system, as you are claiming. He\\'s trying to fix it so that those who need health care but can\\'t afford it can get it. Whether it\\'s in the Constitution or not, the government is there because of the social contract. Therefore, it provides for it\\'s citizens. Obama is trying to suggest a way to make the government provide for the citizenry better, whether it is required to or not. This is not irrational. \"a) global warming is a crock of sh**. b) carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Even if you believe in global warming hysteria, the percentage of pollution caused from CO2 (businesses) is minimal. Putting the environment as a priority of the economy is mentally insane. Obama wants to tax carbon emissions from the corporate and business sector which would seriously cripple and hurt our economy. It would be a complete disaster. This is the liberal agenda...ideology over common sense.\" 1.) I never said anything about global warming. I was talking about pollution. Whether global warming is real or fake, we should protect the environment. Whether global warming is real or fake, I like being able to breathe. 2.) On the whole CO2 thing...

Can you tell me where? Because so far you\\'ve just ranted about how much you hate taxes. Now, look at the resolution and my opponent\\'s original case. He\\'s claiming that Barack is irrational because the government has problems and he\\'s proposing to expand the government in certain areas. What my opponent fails to recognize is these expanisons are made to address these governmental problems. They\\'re made to correct innefficiencies. This has worked in the past. Replacing the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution. The Square Deal. The New Deal. And, as a matter of fact, these solutions are rationally founded. There is no reason why a government can\\'t correct itself, which is what my opponent is implying. It\\'s irrelevant as to whether you agree with Obama or not. It\\'s irrelevant as to whether you think he\\'s plans will work or not. What matters is that these solutions are RATIONALLY FOUNDED.', 'Thank you for starting the debate. My opponent\\'s entire argument reasts on a logical fallacy. This fallacy is that the only possible way to fix governmental problems is to limit the government. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems. Now, looking at my opponent\\'s case against Obama point by point. On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people. On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational. The government is \"broken\" here because it is inefficient in protecting the environment. Obama wants to change that. On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot. Some regulation is a good thing in order to keep these companies in line so they serve Americans as best they can. The government is \"broken\" here because it fails to keep these companies in line. On taxes, Obama wants to repeal certain tax cuts on the upper classes in order to pay for these programs. I realize a lot of people don\\'t like taxes, but the money for correcting these problems has to come from somewhere. Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational. As far as the bureaucracy goes, I don\\'t\\' see any evidence for this. It really just seems like a straw man argument. In order for you to accept my opponent\\'s case, you have to accept that the only rational solution to governmental problems is libertarianism. While I do not negate the possible advantages of libertarianism, it is not the openly rational solution. There is no reason why putting certain governmental programs in place can\\'t correct certain problems. Just because you don\\'t think Obama\\'s plan is the best doesn\\'t make it irrational.', \"Alright. First things first (I'm the realest..gosh that song's old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, let's again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, I'd like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isn't anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up. Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues. After all, what good is trying to organize countries at war?\", 'First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. I\\'d like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldn\\'t be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I don\\'t believe that\\'s a large enough amount to carry any significance in it. As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. I\\'d like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these \"superwars\" that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000). Next, wars don\\'t occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed country\\'s biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesn\\'t take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention. We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also. War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.', 'As for the topic of the debate: I do believe that global warming is not our greatest issue. World peace is an issue of the utmost urgency. Pro states that despite having wars, \"we are still alive and \\'healthy. \\'\" However, I\\'d like to point out that our world is in turmoil today. Global warming only causes fiercer storms, while the agitation in the world produces a much sharper hunger for a reaction.', 'Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the \"point of no return.\" Haven\\'t heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a \"runaway\" in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things don\\'t change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we don\\'t stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the world\\'s economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isn\\'t very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroy\\'s their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?', \"First, this is my first time debating, so apologizes for some mistakes Argument: Hunger you say? That's going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesn't kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years? [1] http://goo.gl...\", 'Global Warming. It is our biggest issue. I didn\"t choose world peace because we were always be fighting. For as long as we have lived, we have fought. And yet, we are still alive and \"healthy\". Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isn\"t going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, it\"s evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that it\"s incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.', 'First I may have the burden of proof but my opponent still needs to prove his case and back it up, and show proof of his claims. opponents first refutation.The roots of my argument is not what he claims. The basis of my position is that pornographic actors are the same as prostitutes. Since prostitution is illegal, and since porn stars are just legal prostitutes. Then pornography(legal prostitution rings) should be illegal. Also Pornography includes child porn witch my opponent never even tackled. Also porn sites easily allow children to break the law and veiw porn. witch is illegal. lastly that pornography Is detrimental. In my case I am not saying that pornography is a direct cause of rape, But that pornography is a major contributing factor, influence,and promotes rape....etc.....he says showing kids watch this stuff is irrelevant......Not true children viewing pornography is illegal. Since were talking about legality this is obviously relevant. Also I don\\'t need to show why pornography should be legal. Thats my opponents job. Also my opponent no where in this entire debate explained why pornography should be legal. He attempted to tackle my case but forgot to validate his own.Also if people in a marriage are curious about sex then get under the covers with your partner. Get in the boat and make some waves. Don\\'t look at porn when you have a perfectly good partner whom your married to and can have sex with. Why fantasise about sex rather than having sex????\" as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image.\"Untrue no wife respects the fact that the husband feels he has to look at porn rather than having sex with him. Because the husband chooses to look at other women this causes the wife to feel unwanted. So viewing porn actually hurts the spouses self esteem........Pornography could make it difficult for your spouse to see sex as a loving form of communication. As a result, pornography can decrease sexual satisfaction within your marriage.my opponents second rebuttalfirst let m prove that pornography is addictive............http://en.wikipedia.org...If you feel that not enough look at the sources cited within my source. So pornography is obviously the cause of porn addiction( just think of the wording). Also if the problem is not enough sex with the spouse. then either divorce them and go find sex or cheat. Don\\'t veiw pornography because its detrimental. especially while married. My opponent says...\" a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. Please lets emphasize on the word A. Yes it is one cause but there is one universal reason people veiw porn. to see legal prostitutes have sex or masturbate. Here\\'s evidence that masturbation decreases penile sensitivity........http://www.medhelp.org.........look at the first couple of comments ..........here\\'s a better source............http://www.articledashboard.com...It affects our country because we have a legal prostitution industry. If porn actors are legal , then prostitution should be legalized. But since its not, and since were a count, based on fairness since prostitution is illegal then pornography should be illegal because porn actors are just prostitutes. Lastly pornography doesnt cause rape but promotes it. Due to the fact that after viewing you of coarse want to have sex. Some cant get a partner. After a while some may get too frustrated and just decide to rape someone because there so backed up.....lol...( my opponent never effectively commented on this).Sex isnt the only thing that porn shows. It shows pictures, masturbation, bondage,masturbation,children,and bestiality. Educating people about sex wont prevent rape. Nor will it change any probability of how porn effects the brain.( just to point this out my opponent calls porn a vile insidious substance, witch supports my case)Lastly if porn is illegal and no one had access to it then people wont have to worry about jail because they couldn\\'t get there hands on it. If I was wrong and they could . Then since its illegal then obviously some legal punishment needs to occur. Are you suggesting that the legal system do nothing if it was illegal??? MY opponents counter to my second argument:My argument is not faulty my opponents counter is faulty though......So since prostitution is illegal and since the person chooses to do it then its not illegal????? This is what my opponent is trying to convince the voter of. Faulty logic.He also says he wants to legalize prostitution. If we legalize prostitution, People who get kidnapped and forced into it may never be found. Since there\\'s no police involvement how will these kidnappies be rescued???? Also in prostitution were to be legalised, we all know there is alot of drugs and gang bang rape. The prostitute may think its just a normal have sex with the john and then go. But behind that dark alley or hotel room door there may be 10 men waiting to rape them. If it was legal then these instances would increase dramatically. Since there would be no police hounding here activity.My opponent says porn reduces crimenot true. His source for his statistics are invalid. To test this hypothesis we would need to know whos going to commit crime before hand. We would also need to find out if these criminals are veiwing porn before they commit crime. The after we know theve been caught and done the crime then we could possibly make a conclusion.....since this experiment is impossible since we don\\'t know who\\'s going to commit a crime before hand this is not valid. In my case I have proven that rape promotes rape or is a contributing factor psychologically. therefore this point shouldn\\'t even be considered.Also about his fifth source a conclusion cannot be made unless we know at what year this study was conducted. Thus not valid.Also I never said that pornography causes rape crimes. My point is that pornography may promote rape and is a contributing factor. Since my opponent cannot successfully rebuttal this, it still is valid.EconomyIf the porn industry was abolished that money could be spent else where to stimulate our economy. Or atleast keep some extra money in our pockets. Also Not all porn has a cost. Most people look at free porn. Lastly we don\\'t have a porn taxabout the first amendmentporn is dissemination. But so is terrorist activity on the web. So in my opponents logic we should allow terrorists to share info of terror via the Internet......... The limit on dissemination is if there is threat or if it contradicts the law. Since prostitution is against the law and since prostitution is the same as porn actors then this contradicts the law.freedom of expression from government interference.........if this is the case then why does the government tax us.Lastly the constitution does not protect porn. Freedom of speech and freedom of action are two different things....prostitution is not freedom of speech it is a obscene act unacceptable in our society and is a action.Also porn is considered obscene and obscenity is not protected by the constitution................http://www.covenanteyes.com...( im out of characters, Please look at my case)Sourceshttp://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://downloads.frc.org......http://downloads.frc.org......http://www.heritage.org......http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org......http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://www.protectkids.com......http://www.covenanteyes.com....http://www.articledashboard.com....http://www.medhelp.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...', 'I will be defending the fact that pornography shouldn\\'t be legal do to some fundamental facts. I will use logic and studies to prove my case.Pornography- is the depiction of sexual behavior that is intended to arouse sexual excitement in its audience. prostitute- a person who receives payment for sexual intercourse or other sexual acts, generally as a regular occupation.porn industry-consists of businesses which either directly or indirectly provide sex-related products and services or adult entertainment. The porn industry includes adult sex-related products and services such as prostitution in all its forms.pornographic actors/porn star- Most notably these performers are not paid directly by their sexual partners for the sex, but both are paid through a studio or Talent Management Agency.I will explain that pornography is detrimental,allows children to illegally view pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Pornographic actors is the same as prostitution,Also pornography includes all of its branches. Witch means my opponent will need to defend child porn,animal porn etc.....1.Pornography is detrimental to societyDaily \"child pornography\" requests---- 116,000Websites offering illegal child pornography----- 100,000Adults admitting to Internet sexual addiction----10%http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com...KEY FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHYTHE FAMILY AND PORNOGRAPHY• Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their conjugal relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Wives notice and are upset by the difference.• Pornography use is a pathway to infidelity and divorce, and is frequently a major factor in these family disasters.• Among couples affected by one spouse’s addiction, two-thirds experience a loss of interest in sexual intercourse.• Both spouses perceive pornography viewing as tantamount to infidelity.http://downloads.frc.org...THE INDIVIDUAL AND PORNOGRAPHY• Pornography is addictive, • Users tend to become desensitized to the type of pornography they use, become bored with it, and then seek more perverse forms of pornography.• Men who view pornography regularly have a higher tolerance for abnormal sexuality, including rape, sexual aggression, and sexual promiscuity. Child-sex offenders are more likely to view pornography regularly or to be involved in its distribution.OTHER EFFECTS http://downloads.frc.org...Pornography, distorts an individual’s concept of sexual relations by objectifying them, which, in turn, alters both sexual attitudes and behavior. It is a major threat to marriage, to family, to children, and to individual happiness.Social scientists, clinical psychologists, and biologists concur.http://www.heritage.org...Effect on the mind: Pornography is very addictive. Some effects of porn addiction are: Escalation/Desensitization: Addicts experience an ever-increasing lust and a craving for more intense porn. Eventually \"soft-core\" porn is not stimulating enough, which pushes them into \"hard-core.\" It is a downward spiral. Dissatisfaction with your sex life: Spouses of addicts are affected as sex does not satisfy the addict as it once did. Men who look at porn are dissatisfied by their wife\\'s appearance and this often leads to dysfunctional relationships. Addiction to masturbation: Those addicted to porn are almost always addicted to masturbation. The sexual urges become so strong that masturbation becomes the easiest way of release. Shame and guilt: Emotional pain is perhaps the most common effect of porn addiction. A deep sense of failure and shame is often experienced. \"Lonerism\" and Secrecy: Porn addicts generally keep to themselves and keep their addiction secret. This often results in dysfunctional relationships. http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org... Pornography affects people’s emotional lives. Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their marital sexual relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Women married to men with a pornography addiction report feelings of betrayal, mistrust, and anger. Pornographic use may lead to infidelity and even divorce. Adolescents who view pornography feel shame, diminished self-confidence, and sexual uncertainty. http://downloads.frc.org... Pornography hurts adults, children, couples, families, and society. Either by promoting overly aggressive,child pornography,Pornography has significant effects during all stages of family life. For a child exposed to pornography within a family setting, pornography causes stress and increases the risk for developing negative attitudes about the nature and purpose of human sexuality. For adolescents who view pornography, their attitudes toward their own and others’ sexuality change, and their sexual expectations and behavior are shaped accordingly. For adults, pornography has harmful and even destructive effects on marriage. Pornography is more detrimental then beneficial thus should not be practiced. 2.allows children to illegally veiw pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Porn sites don\\'t do much to prevent children from viewing. There required by law to ask if your 18 or 21 in some states. On most if not all porn sites you just have to press a button. Yes or no. There\\'s no birthday check or anything like that witch could single children out to disallow access. Porn is very much available to children. Access to pornography is available from early on. The average age of a child’s first exposure to pornography is 11. A total of 90 percent of children ages 8-16 have viewed pornography online. Pornographers use many character names that appeal to children such as “Pokémon.”.........http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com... According to The Kaiser Family Foundation report (found at www.kff.org), 70% of teenagers (ages 15-17 \"have accidentally come across pornography on the Web.\"....... According to one study, early exposure (under fourteen years of age) to pornography is related to greater involvement in deviant sexual practice, particularly rape. Slightly more than one-third of the child molesters and rapists in this study claimed to have at least occasionally been incited to commit an offense by exposure to pornography. Among the child molesters incited, the study reported that 53 percent of them deliberately used the stimuli of pornography as they prepared to offend...........http://www.protectkids.com... W. L. Marshall, \"The Use of Sexually Explicit Stimuli by Rapists, Child Molesters, ,\" The Journal of Sex Research 25, no.2 (May 1988): 267-88. 3.porn actors same as prostitutes. If you look at the definitions there very similar. If you think about it morally they provide the same services for a fee. Since the porn industry advertises these porn stars,(just as pimps advertise prostitutes)and since the workers are offering sex for money,( just like prostitutes). it ought to be illegal as well. Morally atleast. Also this could be under obscenity witch is not protected in anyway morally. the only difference with porn stars is that there under the camera, have a director,its legal,they sign a contract. This is just legal prostitution. Another point I want to make is that pornography includes all branches of pornography. That means child porn, animal porn, etc.......my opponent needs to defend it. So in my case I have effectively proven,That pornography is more detrimental than good, Allows children to illegally veiw porn due to inadequate age confirmation systems, and lastly that porn actors are the same as prostitutes thus should be treated the same as prostitutes and thus pornography should be illegal.', 'My position is pretty obvious. I will prove that pornography is immoral for unobvious reasons.( atleast i think there unobvious reasons....lol) and should be illegal and that the bad outweighs the good. I hope to have a great debate.', 'BOP- My opponent has it as she advocates a chance in the status quo, is an instigator, and is PRO. As she has not specified otherwise I say he has the BOP. --Refutations--My opponents C1:The basis of my opponents argument is it hurts family, and mainly kids through addiction. The argument on who watches the type of video is irrelevant, as if I refute the premise below, then the argument is defeated. The majority of my opponents argument after showing kids watch this stuff (irrelevant), she shows things like it is detrimental to the marriage institution. My opponents only links the cons on a marriage, but does not show the pros and the intermediates. Many people who are really holy holy marriage people may, you know, become curious. But they may think look at this slu*, she does not enjoy her husband. Some people say pornography is good for the sexual imagination, and moderate usage may enhance sex life. Some less committed woman may actually approve of the watching of pornography, as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image. If she thinks she has a good one, it should not really effect her. [1]My opponent then contends it is addictive, causes rape, and they may become desensitized. I will first refute the addiction part of it. There is actually a controversy on whether it is addictive or not, whether it is the porn or some other aspect in life. Many contend it is outside arguments, and things that make it hard to even have a sex life that lead the to this hole. So the problem may not be the porn, rather a non sexual spouse. Others say if you treat them like addicts it may be detrimental to the viewer. [2] The basis of my opponents argument is flawed as there is a high controversy on the issue. He then claims they become desensitized. My question is so what? They get bored they can not watch it, or watch worse why does it effect you or the country? Why is it the governments job to intervene? Also, a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. So the best way to control it may be handing out free books :P. My opponent then claims it causes rape. I refer you to my arguments in C1.My opponents final argument is it changes the concept of the human brain, yet forgets any porn watching is not sex watching or a sex addiction. Sex requires two individuals procreating, or two individuals just doing their thing. Porn would unlikely effect sex life with education programs showing porn =/= sex. Education, not banning, may be a better way to control the vile insidious substance.---> Sex lifesee above.---> masturbation addiction kinda gross, but this does not hold up unless you show its bad. ---> shamecool. So making it illegal and if they watch it (hard to censor the internet) and throwing them in jail is better for the problem? No, legal porn and throwing them in education programs is better.---> Loner^^My opponents C2: The basis of my opponents full argument is the filters are not good enough. Well my opponent may have just conceded the argument right there. He said the filters, not the porn is the problem. Instead of taking away some creepy dudes fun away, mandate a filter, make current filters stronger. This here would fix all of the problems you listed, without abashment. Abloishment is not needed as you added in the words filter. He then says it makes kids rapist. See my C1.My opponents C3:My opponents argument is faulty even if it is correct, as porn stars CHOOSE to get into the job they are in. He also has to prove it is bad, as when you legalize prostitution it gets safer for them. [3] So making it legal not only helps the people, but makes it safer. And again, they CHOOSE to be there, not the governments business. --Case--C1: Porn reduces crime This argument is logically sound either way, as they spend more times watching this crap then grabbing people into alleys. \"The bottom line on these experiments is, \"More Net access [Porn], less rape.\" A 10 percent increase in Net access yields about a 7.3 percent decrease in reported rapes.\" [4]\"Results from the Czech Republic showed, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes have not increased following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. In addition, the study found that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible -- a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan.\"[5] Didn\\'t my opponent say it rose rape and moles rapes, yet I just proved it doesn\\'t without using bsse sources? (my opponent used frc). As I am low on space I must continue. C2: Economy \"The statistics are truly staggering. According to compiled numbers from respected news and research organizations, every second $3,075.64 is being spent on pornography.\" [6]Imagine it though! Banning it would likely be ineffective, but would still constrict this money supply to our economy. Aboloshment would be detrimental. Porn is worth 14 billion per year, that is huge. [7] Banning it woudl likely shrink our economy by 10 billion dollars, and piss off a lot of people. The economy benefits on porn, and banning it is actually counter productive economically. Also I forgot, we could tax it if it was legal ;).C3: 1st amendment the first amdnment-\"protects the right to freedom of religion and freedom of expression from government interference. \"[8]\"Despite popular misunderstanding the right to freedom of the press guaranteed by the first amendment is not very different from the right to freedom of speech. It allows an individual to express themselves through publication and dissemination\" [8]Internet counts as dissemination. [9] With this being said, this now makes it IMPOSSIBLE to ban pornogorphy under the constitution. Now, no matter what arguments in this debate happen if this argument stands I get an auto win. Conclusion: You cannot ban porn, it lowers crime, and it is bneficial to the economy. I think I have proven her arguments wrong or have semi-reufted them. Also to add, my opponent has not fufilled the BOP. Vote CON.http://www.debate.org...', 'I can devils advocate this I accept.', 'Yes, you have the BOP, and I have fulfilled it already, you have not. --First refutation--My opponent mixed the order, but ok. The argument here is they are prostitutes, therefore it should be illegal. My opponent now opens up a huge new debate on the sex laws. Now, the resolution states ought to be illegal, this means this argument too considers the \"ought\" factor. So, my opponent first must prove pornography, and in this argument prostitution should be illegal. Also the majority of his case says this is bad for women. The funny thing is, prostitutes, when legalized, have lower AIDS rates then when it is legal. [1] Now, when we make things illegal it becomes less clean, as we see from the drug war, and it is STILL used. And it would be extremely hard to censor it. The current porn industry has many scans for STD\\'s, one check every 30 days. [2] Now that is illegal, (assume your side prevails in the laws) then the industry WILL form a black market, and make it less safe. My opponents cause now stands defeated here, as the ought in the resolution acts in my favor.My opponent essentially conceded that children watching porn is illegal, which proves my point. It is impossible to ban this stuff, and a ban would to little to lower users, etc. In pakistan, they have a ban on this vile stuff, yet the amount of people watching it within the country is still high. [3] The basis of my opponents argument fails because even if we ban it it just enters a black market making it LESS SAFE, and the same problems with the porn industry live, and get worse (STD\\'s). My opponent then bolds the statement I have not justified my arguments below, which is false. I have explained the benefits of legal porn: Economic and crime wise, then I proved it was impossible to ban via 1st amendment. My opponent must have really not read me saying CASE, which is arguments for porn staying legal. Her bolded statement is false. I think ANY reader can see where my justification is.My opponents next argument is if your interested in intercourse, why not have intercourse. There are many reasons, nagging wives, a refusing wife, you do not want to risk pregnancy again or ever. There are many reasons to have fantasies then procreate with your wive. My opponent also only refutes one of the arguments I presented with the marriage thing. As stated, porn means some things to people, different things to other. [4] So some marriages it will not effect. It also teaches new techniques, discovers your sexuality with your wife, and helps find ways it \"turns you on\", therefore helping you and your spouse. [4] My opponent ONLY refuted ONE of the benefits presented, the it will not effect you if you have a good self image. This is a fact, as if you have confidence you will prevail. His case here is no woman would like a man watching a porn star, the funny thing is some marriages watch it together!! [4] Like: \"With the availability of porn at your fingertips couples using it together is a new phenomenon in many relationships. More and more couples are using pornography to help stimulate their sex life. \" [4]These couples have no problem with this, and my opponents case forgets the upsides to porn in a relationship. --Second-- My opponents argumet here is porn is addictive, \"look as the sources\", and I urge the same. There is actually evidence in that wikipedia article disagreeing with her, and states pornography addiction may not exist. Addiction is a usage of a drug or substance that changes mood, and has adverse effects on the body and mind. [5] Now my opponent has not proven it changes mood at all, just cites an FRC article saying it causes rape. It may not be the porn they are addicted too, but social life and moods make them visit these sites, which implies it is social life, not porn that is causing the so called addiction. [6]My opponents next comparison, again, opens up the debate to prostitution. As I am devils advocating this whole debate, let me argue for that statement too. Prostitution = more things to tax hence more revenues. Also it opens up a new economic market, and as stated lowers AIDS rates from prostitutes, from when they operate illegally, which they DO. My opponent has not proven prostitution \"ought\" to be banned. As this is the case, I win this argument too.My opponent then talks about it shows bestiality, yet he has no facts to prove any of his assertions. Her argument is education and rehab will not prevent rape, although porn already reduces rape numbers, my opponent ha snot proved how rehabilitation and education would not do anything. We can compare this to Portugal, they legalized drugs and rehab the people, it has worked great, and these people are addicted. No reason rehab would fail. My opponents argument then goes people would not have access. I refer to above. Abolishment would not work. --Third--God prostitution is all over this debate. My opponent then claims people would be kidnapped, like they are now. This is funny. Making it illegal causes the kidnaps as they need to get people to do it and convince them the police wont get them. In Nevada, where is is legal in certain areas, this never happens. My opponents argument is a fallacy, when t is sometimes the laws, not the practice that makes the problems. And remember the benefits of prostitution legalization above.__________________________________________________________________________________________________--Crime--My opponent claims my source is faulty, but this is funny as well. It looked at trends, needing to foresee the future is not needed in this case, this means your biased christian source [FRC] is false too as it does not foresee the future. needing to know who rapes is irrelevant, but the overall statistic is needed. We see once porn becomes legal, RAPE RATES DECREASE. \"the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85% in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults [7].\"\"An academic has claimed to RAW STORY that a decline in reported rape of 85% in the past 25 years can be tied to an increase in pornography consumption. \" [8]\"When compared to Disaster Center\\'s figures for forcible rape for the years 1980 and 2000, the four states with the lowest Internet access showed a 53% aggregate per capita increase in rape, while the four states with the highest Internet access showed a 27% decrease in incidence of rape.\"[8]Point proven.--economics--My opponents argument it will be spent elsewhere. That\\'s not how an economy works, you take away an industry the economy collapses. Extend argument. --First amendment-- First, we can only deprive this right if it infringes life liberty or pursuit of happiness. It actually increases all 3. Also the only time they can regulate speech is commerce, if they feel a compelling interest in nuetral speech, or regulation based on the way the message is sent. [9] the argument only works if it hurts people, it does not.My opponent then asks why does the government tax us. This shows little understanding of law. If the state has an interest to do something, as long as its compelling, they are allowed to do anything. There is no interest to break the 1t amendment for porn. My opponent then says it protects speech, not porn. Porn is an expression, 1st amendment protects expression, [10] it is unconstitutional to ban it. My opponents last argument is it is obscene, does it infringe life liberty or pursuit of happiness? No. No effect on life. Increases liberty, freedom of choice. And no effect on happiness, if it is ugly dont watch it. It is protected by the first amendment. Conclusion: 1. pro has not met the BOP2. Porns benefits outweigh the false negatives presented by pro3. VOTE PROarguments - con, BOP not met by pro, and I refuted her argumentseverything else tied or you choose.I enjoyed this debate, literally our of room.http://tinyurl.com...', 'Dear Rose212, I am not talking only about America. I am talking about what is happening globally. And in my opinion, low test scores have nothing to do with how governments influence schools with their beliefs. Students still know things, even with the low test scores and the low literacy rates. And if you still believe that schools and government have no relationship between them, then why some researchers show that people with low literacy rate tend to believe easier what is said to them? so, they will believe what they are told without any second thoughts or doubts about what they have heard. About the wars section. Yes, indeed we have wars but each country tries to make its citizens believe that they werent responsible about it. And like i have previously said, Cypriots learn the cypriot side and Turskish people the turkish side without being sure if what they have just learned is true or not. They just believe it because its their country telling something and they learn it from primary education until highschool or until college! So, in order to keep the government up dont they do it from schools?', \"@Rose212 I dont disagree with you. However, dont you think that governments put students learn what they want them too? For example, in history books, each country shows what they want them to learn and believe. For example, Americans learn that america hasnt done any mistakes and dont know the whole story. Another example is with Cyprus. In their history books they learn that Turkish done horrible thing during the war of 74 and Turkish's in their history books show that they did the war just to keep peace and that the turkish people who were at the island were at risk so they came to save them. So what side is the correct one? no one really knows, except from the governments and those who signed different contracts during the war. So each government provides students with the information they want them to know. To sum up, i still believe that schools keep the government alive.\", 'Some people argue that schools are made up to create nations and to keep the governments alive.

How do school\\'s keep the government alive?', \"In the context of the free will argument, I meant that those who put Jesus to death had free will. I wasn't referring to the individual dying, I meant those that cause the death. Although, I can see how what said could be misinterpreted. Just for the record. I accept your forfeit. Thanks for the debate. It was fun. I look forward to future debates as well.\", '\"I had no idea that sitting in my car after it stalls on the railroad tracks and letting the train hit me, in not suicide. I only wish the insurance company and the law agreed.\" Well, it\\'s not exactly that simple. The action of allowing the train to hit you in the vast majority of cases essentially takes the away the agency of the train driver. Let me explain further, the train driver often cannot stop in time to prevent the death of the individual. That\\'s why the individual in question would be committing suicide. He is taking advantage of the lack of control a train to end their own life. The only one with free will in the scenario is the individual, as any choice the driver makes will result in the death of person choosing to end their life. Pilate chose to have Jesus executed. Jesus did allow it, but the people who brought him to Pilate, Pilate who ordered the execution, and the people who put him on the cross all had their free will. They could have refused to go any further with the execution of Jesus. Would it have been futile? Yes. Would Jesus have been executed anyway? Definitely. However, those people still chose to end Jesus\\' life. You are the only one choosing to end your life in the train scenario. \"So if I pay you to kill me, it\\'s not my action but only yours?\" Legally, yes. \"I know we are talking about Christianity, but in other religions allowing yourself to be killed for a higher cause is supposed to be a Holy act, isn\\'t it?\" First, we aren\\'t talking about other religions so this is completely irrelevant. Second, even if we were, allowing yourself to be killed is not suicide. I await my opponents final response.', 'I will be arguing that Jesus did not commit suicide. Lets get the definition of suicide first. Suicide : the act or an instance of taking one\\'s own life voluntarily and intentionally Now that we know the definition. Lets discuss. 1. Jesus didn\\'t commit suicide by definition Jesus foresaw his death, yes. However, he did not take his own life. For example, in the hypothetical scenario where I am a cancer patient and I decide to shoot myself, that would be suicide. If I in a different example, had a friend shoot me instead, my friend\\'s actions would be considered homicide. Jesus essentially gave his permission to the Romans/Jewish leader to have him executed. However, he did not take his own life. His death was and still is considered death by crucifixion. 2. Suicide is a sin in the Christian Bible (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) [19] Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; [20] you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17 NIV) [16] Don\\'t you know that you yourselves are God\\'s temple and that God\\'s Spirit lives in you? [17] If anyone destroys God\\'s temple, God will destroy him; for God&\\'s temple is sacred, and you are that temple. I feel as though these verses make it clear that suicide, the act of one destroying their \"temple\" is considered a sin as demonstrated in Corinthians. Suicide is clearly a sin. If we assume that Jesus foresaw his death, then we must also assume (for the purposes of this debate) that Jesus was the Son of God. Now, the purpose of Jesus\\' death on the cross was the be a perfect, and sinless sacrifice for the world. So, since suicide is a sin and Jesus is sinless, Jesus could not have committed suicide. I await my opponents response.', \"Jesus had very free will. He very easily could have gotten out of Dodge and avoided his foreseen and predicted death. Whether it was a ticking bomb or a speeding train or a bunch of servants ordered by authorities under strict control He willingly sacrificed Himself for a cause. Certainly a good cause indeed, but a voluntary submission to be killed. I do agree that Jesus would never have committed suicide without a higher purpose. I'm convinced that Jesus committed martyrdom and not conventional suicide. You win the debate. You don't need to explain to me what a train is, it was my story. I look forward to future debates.----->Face-of-the-deep\", \"I had no idea that sitting in my car after it stalls on the railroad tracks and letting the train hit me, in not suicide.

This is the resolution as proposed by my opponent: Resolved: The US Government should ban guns. My definition of ban is yet to be challenged by my opponent, and I will stand by it. “Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.)” I never specify if this is a total gun ban or not, I use the blanket term guns and I do not specify the type of firearms that would be targeted, and I do not state “all guns” I simply stated “guns.” It would be illogical to think that I would propose an idea such as that given the examples used by both me and my opponent not being complete bans. Australia targeted semi-automatic guns, Britain banned handguns, and other countries that my opponent has brought up have not banned all guns anyway. Thus, if my opponent is truly wanting to debate a full gun ban, then he has not proved legitimate harms from passing the resolution since we both used partial bans in our points. In which case, this debate has devolved into meaningless dribble on both sides. Next, the 2nd amendment is brought up. My opponent states that an English expert stated that the 2nd amendment is an individual one. However, as the said expert explains, the interpretation is purely linguistic and takes into account the exact meaning of the constitution. Next, he cites a YouTube video, under any evidence standard, YouTube videos do not provide information worthy of putting into a case. Remember, video on YouTube can easily be biased in favor of one’s ideology. Also, state constitutions are different based on whether a liberal or conservative majority is in government positions. In places like California, Iowa, and Maryland have no provisions even concerning guns, while certain states allow for the public to be protected from policy that aims to clean up crime (1). My opponent also claims that the newer precedents of the interpretation of the 2nd amendment are somehow more valid simply because they are newer. Remember, the fact that there is such debate over the 2nd amendment’s limits imply that there is grey area where the interpretation of the amendment is concerned. After all, the court has decided other amendments to be limited in some ways as well. For example, in Davis vs. Boheim, the court upheld that defamation of character had to be proved with 4 criteria, but still was a crime. The founding fathers could not have determined the influx of gun crime in the US and certainly would not know that superior gun technology would exist to the point that automatic and semi-automatic weapon fire would exist, given the weapon of choice in the past to be muskets and flint lock pistols. Next, he attempts to attack my point about the fact that over a million children live in a household where a weapon is readily available. He brings up child negligence laws, which he claims that since the laws designed to prevent children becoming injured or killed and are still not enforced, neither would my ban. First, he conflates two different issues that are not in relation with each-other. There is no child negligence law federally that prevents where parents store the weapon if they have children, meaning that there is nothing to conflate to begin with. Also, I have defined the word “ban” with this in mind and mentioned raising penalties, which would deter the number of people who would break this law. Rebuttal 2: Suicides My opponent basically concedes to my suicide point by saying it is someone’s right to do so, and furthers this by claiming suicide to be a victimless crime. This is not the case, many people are effected by the decision to ends one’s life, including family members, friends etc. Not only this, but saving any life is inherently a benefit to everyone, as we affirm the right that people own to life. If suicide is to be legal anyway, it should be administered by a doctor, thus preventing trauma from other family members and friends. Next, he claims that many criminals are scared off from other people owning weapons. He has yet to refute my Boston University example and simply scoffed when I showed the fact that the CDC is not able to show benefits of gun control. Also, regardless of what the executive branch’s opinion is in this matter, it should be mentioned that at the time, and possibly even now, the legislative branch, where actual law gets passed is split on the issue. Also, my opponent claims that the Australia model will not work in America due to different demographics and beliefs held between the two nations. However, the Australian party in charge of the legislative branch equivalent was conservative, many not favoring the NFA (3). My opponent seems to think that by enacting any gun ban, we would guarantee that public violence would spark. The fact that it did not in any other country, despite conservative notions and outrage, points in the opposite direction. My opponent states that Australia’s homicide rate did not lower, even though he never directly states why. I have offered stats to the contrary. His statistic claimed that other crimes not associated with guns increased. Yet, he has yet to link the ban with higher rates of other crime. Also, need I remind you that Australia had significantly lower crime rates as a result? I have already shown you the graph in last round and the fact that homicide and suicide were lowered significantly (4). Also, the fact that crime decrease in Australia despite many people owning guns means that we would still have a decrease in crime, and death as a result. My opponent mentions the fact that there is no protection from tyranny. This is despite the fact that I have not advocated for a total ban on guns, meaning that people can still own some types of firearms, just not certain ones such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Also, assuming that the people of another country come and try to kill us, we would still have superior military forces, technology, and ability. The likeliness of anyone attacking us is slim at best to begin with, and I can assure you that people who have not been trained in combat scenarios will not even put up a fight against other country’s military, making this point non-unique, because in the event that my opponent proposes, there is little likeliness of survival for any civilian. The next example my opponent uses is the fact that gun control can be used to oppress people, using the example of slaves being oppressed by these laws from revolting. This is a straw-man fallacy, since the debate is about the general welfare of the people, and the fact that it “was” used to suppress people does not mean that the moment we pass gun control, the entire government starts oppressing its citizens. Rebuttal 3: Economy Again, the economy can be fixed, but the lives of the people is priceless. Since my opponent makes no argument against the welfare of the people framework, his argument does not stand. May it also be known that the manufacturing of all goods are being outsourced as we speak, meaning that in a few years, this will not even matter as other countries or robots manufacture the guns. Conclusion With the lives of the people at stake, and the obvious coming to light, one must vote in the affirmation. Good luck to my opponent as we approach the end of the debate. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...)', 'Rebuttal 1: 2nd amendment The 2nd amendment does not guarantee the right to own weapons without restriction. The Cornell Legal Dictionary states the exact language of the 2nd amendment as such: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" (1) An individual does not have the right to own a firearm without restriction. In fact, a Supreme Court case has established that the 2nd amendment is fluid in interpretation. The case in question is the United States vs. Miller case in 1934 which dealt with the regulation of a sawed-off shotgun under the National Firearms Act of the 1930s and established the original intent of the 2nd amendment was to establish militias to counter oppression, and that since the sawed-off shotgun had any reasonable relationship with a well-regulated militia, the 2nd amendment did not protect it (1). While other precedents later established the contrary, the fact that the original intent of the 2nd amendment was considered to be for the purposes of a militia still continues. Not only this, but there have been gun bans before other precedents have been set. For instance, there have been Assault Weapons Bans and provisions in the early 1990s that was not struck down as constitutional. However, if you really want a look at how people interpret the 2nd amendment, we need to look at popular opinion. According to a poll conducted by YouGov and the Huffington Post, over 80% of people support not allowing people to purchase guns if they are on the terrorist watch list (2). This, in itself is a gun ban, which falls under the resolution regardless of the type of weapon, or person purchasing said weapon. Thus resolution states “a” gun ban, not a “total gun ban” in which all weapons are confiscated or outlawed. Thus, the second amendment does not apply in this debate. Remember, we are talking about the general welfare of the people, which affirming the right to life does, while the second amendment has only led to people protecting the right of those to shoot others, the right to life is universally upheld by everyone and is more ingrained into society than the 2nd amendment. My opponent also claims that the majority of the gun owners in the US do not actually commit crimes or fall victim to gun accidents. I would be inclined to agree were it not for my framework. My framework states that we only value the promotion of the general welfare, and not the scope of the people affected. Even if I can only prove that the number of accidental shootings decreased, or the crime decreased is minimal, I still win based on the fact that the general welfare of the people is better off. Rebuttal 2: Violent crime rate My opponent is mistaken significantly. Not only have I proven the fact that there has been a notable decrease in homicide and suicide with or without guns used by 1.4% per annum (3), but he cites a questionable statistic that misses the point. My opponent claims that the prevalence of other crimes increased, but has yet to link it to the gun ban. Since the link is never made, the entire statistic is meaningless. This is especially true since the author of the NCPA article was Howard Nemerov, someone unknown to the world of academic publishing and posts articles to the website freerepublic.com, leading me to believe that at best, this source is questionable. I will address the argument that the rate of crime returned to pre-ban rates with a graph modeling the actual decrease in crime. We can look toward the evidence compiled from New York Times for this, from a previously used statistic (4). Also, there have been no mass shootings thus far in Australia since the gun ban, saving precious lives. Next, my opponent brings up Kennesaw, Georgia’s law that mandates gun ownership which purportedly stopped the city from devolving into the “wild, wild, west.” This is likely to occur anyway given the demographics and population of the city. City-Data reports a population of under 50,000 people and an average income about $10,000 higher than the rest of the state (5). Compare this to the millions living in Houston, New York, San Diego, and Philadelphia (6). The cities that are more susceptible to gun violence are in places where there are plenty of people, and poverty. This is because people look toward crime as a means of escape and possibly funding if they are part of organized crime, and that there are more people to shoot at with a greater risk of conflict when people are in close proximity. Regardless, the Kennesaw example simply does not work, and is clearly not representative of all of America. My opponent then calls to action through the policy of allowing teachers, principals, and other school officials to carry weapons. There is a major problem with this argument, and that one is human error. The American Journal of Epidemiology finds significant correlations between owning a firearm and gun violence in the form of homicide and suicide (7). It is not apparent that a teacher, principal, or whatever school official would not just leave the weapon out in the open. I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon, which could mean access to said firearm and resulting in mass shootings as well as gun accidents (8). Ultimately, the gun ban proposal in Australia is shown to have worked by my evidence provided. Also, the counter-proposal to the gun ban could lead to more harm and more of a threat to the general welfare of the people. Rebuttal 3: Defense My opponent first states that guns are used to prevent tyrannical government takeovers, animals that would attack people, and criminals. Later, he cites a report claiming a significant deterrent between gun ownership and deterrence of crime. Live-Science reports that Boston University conducted a similar study and found evidence correlating higher homicide rates and gun ownership (9). Not only this, but I have already linked owning a weapon with the higher chance of ending up dead due to homicide or suicide as reported from the American Journal of Epidemiology (7). Not only this, but the study was conducted in 1995, during a federal weapons ban and higher incarceration rates. In other words, the times were different, and since the criminals were unaware of who had a gun due to said ban, the fear of a gun would be irrational. My opponent also brings up a poll of inmates which, in his own statistic, proves to be unreliable as the lead of the study restricted the sample size to those who had begun their sentences in 1979 or have been out of jail since then (10). It goes without saying that the fact that people were still scared of guns under my opponents estimate during the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that proves despite what restrictions we place on guns; people will still be frightened as they are not rational actors. Not only this, but lowered crime rates as shown by Australia would suggest less of a need to use guns as self-defense as opposed to a knife or any other weapon. The CDC report is not shocking in its results given the fact that, as reported by LA Times, the CDC for the past 20 years have been forbidden from advocating or spending money to promote gun control meaning that the research had to be stopped, despite its truth or fallacious value (11). This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently. In other words, my offensive arguments hold water in today’s debate, meaning an affirmative vote is necessary. Rebuttal 4: Economy First, there are other industries where manufacturing other goods besides guns can occur. Also, given the lives lost by not affirming this resolution, this impact is not as important. I even state in my framework that the economy can be fixed, but once a life is lost, it can’t be brought back. Rebuttal 5: Violence would ensue I never argued for a total gun ban, as this was not part of the resolution. I have only addressed Australia’s model, which was not a complete ban either. I have already shown you that there is support for a ban on firearms sold to those on the terrorist watch list, which would be a gun ban as well, with over 80% of people in favor of the idea (2). In other words, there is no guaranteed violent crime outbreak from NRA supporters. There would be outrage by some, as shown by the fact that conservative officials were in charge of the NFA in Australia, but the saving of people is a bipartisan issue, and I am certain people will see it that way, just like people did after the NFA was passed. Conclusion My burden in this debate is to prove that a gun ban would be beneficial to the people’s general welfare, as stated in the framework of the debate which my opponent has yet to challenge. Thus, this is a victory for the affirmation. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...) 5. (http://tinyurl.com...) 6.

Also, it is imperative that definitions account for the specific language in the resolution. Ban: Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.) Guns: Firearms. Framework We need weigh the impact of the general welfare of the people in today’s debate higher than any other impact. This is due to the fact that lives are priceless and the prevailing theories about debates such as this is that the number of people who are harmed by guns are a much bigger problem than the economy, which can always be fixed. Thus, if I can prove that the gun ban promotes the general welfare of the people, then the judges should feel comfortable to vote in my favor, and vice-versa for my opponent. Contention 1: Gun bans have been successful in reducing gun violence There is significant evidence pointing toward national gun bans to be the best way to reduce gun violence and crime. To see this, we turn toward Australia, the nation that has single-handedly decimated the gun violence in their own nation. This was accomplished by passing the National Firearms Agreement of 1996 as a reaction to the brutal massacre at a Tasmanian Seaside Resort (1). Harvard in 2007 reported that the result was that within 7 years of the installment of the sweeping policy that outlawed the majority of firearms and raised penalties for owning said weapons, the firearm suicide rate was cut in half from over 2/100,000 to 1.1/100,000 (1). This created a major dip in the total suicide rate not relating to firearms, as shown by the Guardian in June of 2016 when it states that the 1996 reforms resulted in the rising rate of suicides non-firearm suicides and homicides from 2.1% a year to 1.4% decline, which researchers attribute to the fact that people were not looking toward other methods of suicide or homicide (2). As previously mentioned, the rate of homicides also decreased significantly after the reforms were passed. The New York Times reports that despite the growing population of Australia, and the conservative nature of the government, these reforms did pass and resulted in the homicide rate decreasing by 50% in the decade after installment and has been on the decline since (3). Again, the rate of total homicide was shown to decrease as well, as criminals did not switch to another weapon to commit the crime they would have intended to have done (3). This can be attributed to the fact that guns are the most available type of weapon with a significant chance to inflict mortal damage. A knife is unwieldy and does not result in the same mortality rate as guns. The Annals of Emergency Medicine Journal in a 2003 report examined 4,122 patients and found that of those who were shot, 1/3 of them died, while only 7.7% died from knife wounds (4). It is harder to approach someone and aim for a vital organ without the victim knowing than it is to simply aim for a vital organ of said victim with a weapon. Given the fact that the majority of the guns used in homicides today are handguns, (as compiled from FBI data,) we can most definitely see that weapons which are small and fit in one’s hand are hard to see from the perspective of an unsuspecting victim (5). By decreasing the murder rate, we establish more peace in cities and suburbs that were fraught with gun violence beforehand, thus protecting the safety of the people and promoting the general welfare. We provide a safe environment for people to live in which ultimately means we protect their right to life without due process, as the taking of a life is in violation of this, which is again, promoting the general welfare of the people. Thus, one must cast a vote in the affirmation. Contention 2: Prevent gun accidents from occurring as well as lapses in judgement Gun accidents are prevalent in the status quo, much to the ire of many people. What is more disturbing is who fall victim in these gun accidents. Slate magazine quoted David Hemmingway in his book Private Guns, Public Health of the University of Michigan Press in 2006 which states that children are nine times more likely to die by gun accident in the US than any other nation in the developed world (6). These are preventable circumstances and should never occur as the children are our future educators, lawyers, and basically our entire job force. Despite the fact that there are training methods for children to prevent accidents like these from occurring, there is significant evidence to the contrary. Hardy MS of the Eckerd College in St. Petersburg FL in a report showed that out of 34 children aged 4-7, even after given the safety program, over 50% of them actually played with a firearm when given an opportunity to do so (7). With over 1 million children living in a household where a firearm is unlocked and not put away, or loaded according to the International Business Times in January of 2016, we can see that the current gun culture has ruined many people’s lives (8). However, this brings us to the question, of whether there is a safe way to store a firearm. The answer is a resounding no. The American Journal of Epidemiology found correlations between owning a firearm and increased chance of homicide, and suicide. Specifically speaking, nearly ¾ of suicide victims lived in a household with a gun, which is the same for 42% of homicide victims (9). What is more disturbing is the fact that a huge portion of the homicides were attributed to family disagreements, making up over 30% of homicides (9). People are simply not rational to be able to be under the stress of society, their job, their family, and their own hopes to own a weapon and assume that they will use it correctly. This is especially true if we look at American Medical News which reports in 2010 that there are about 15 million adults with depression in a given year, many of whom will not receive treatment (10). In fact, a 201 Live-science article reports that half of the depressed population does not get the treatment they need (11). This certainly has a correlation with the suicide rate and shows that Americans simply cannot own weapons in the way we want to in the status quo with millions of guns in circulation. In other words, we prevent the people who need psychological help from committing suicide while providing for the welfare of children and guaranteeing that the American people are not as likely to die from their own weapons. Thus, I am upholding the framework which states that we care about the people that will be effected by the resolution, ultimately leading to an obvious vote in the affirmation. Contention 3: Upholding life It is the sworn duty of the government to uphold the and protect the rights of the people so they do not become slaves to an oppressive and abusive government. By affirming, we do this because we set a precedent for upholding the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as outlined by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence (12). These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, and that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they are represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, and the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law and has the right to life, liberty, and property. These ideas are based on the philosophy of John Locke, an enlightenment figure who inspired the creation of our government (13). This leads us to realize that by not holding up the job of the government, we are suppressing the people’s rights by allowing copious gun violence to continue and thus violating their autonomous right to life without due process of law. In this way, the US has an obligation to fix this problem posthaste and stop the violation of rights in the US, thus promoting the general welfare by giving people what they were promised by the political documents that established our country. Conclusion We need to affirm the resolution and save lives that would be lost without our ability to counter the threat. By doing so we prevent homicides, suicides, accidents, lapses of judgement, and to protect the rights of the American people from further encroachment. I have shown that under the affirmative world, the general welfare is upheld and thus, fulfilling my burden of proof, thank you. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3.

Freedom & Law The confiscation, outlawing, & penalization of the ownership of guns. That is what your definition presented means. That means confiscating people of their weapons, making it illegal to own one, & if anyone that slipped through the cracks & caught later then they will be charged with a crime. The resolution is the US should ban guns, not the US government should ban certain people of having guns. As you also stated in your previous round \"the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away,\" The 2nd amendment is an individual right, an expert on the English language [1] [2] [3] as well as a much newer Supreme Court cases states it to be the case. [4] [5] State constitutions calling it as such. [6] The meaning come even more clear when you also look at the intent of the Founders. Essentially an overturned court case hold no importance at all. Even if it did, assault weapons most definitely would fall under such arguments and therefore shouldn\\'t result in banning them. However this argument regards all guns. \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" \" Samuel Adams. [7] In order for the government to deny everyone\\'s right to bear arms, they can\\'t make the case of the \\'greater good of the general welfare\\', they must make the case for each individual has committed a crime grave enough to warrant that person\\'s right be restricted for the \\'greater good\\', cause due process. This can\\'t be done for 99.99% majority hasn\\'t committed a crime \"I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon,\" I\\'ve already brought up laws already established that penalizes negligence & child endangerment, if that law can\\'t be enforced with only 2 million guilty. There is no way humanly possible to enforce a law on 100-150 million people whom are against such a thing and has already act in defiance of such things. Estimated crime with the use of a gun is at 500,000, the number of cases in defense of a crime is considerably more. Since there already laws established under due process to restrict people convicted of a crime grave enough to warrant a restriction. There are not among the debate like the 10s of millions innocent who are accident, homicide, or suicide free, that would be affected by the definition presented. A person convicted of a crime results in their rights be restricted, not everyone\\'s right. That is due process So again from the aspect of freedom & legality, this argument is done. Suicides Suicide is a victim less \\'crime\\', ultimately the peoples\\' right to do so. A person has a right to their own, hence their right to end it if they wish. Therefore, the act of voluntarily taking ones own life as a reason to remove the vast majority of the peoples\\' right to defend theirs should be dropped & ignored. In my last round I showed that a large % of criminals was scared off before completion of a crime & even prevented a crime from taking place. This mindset for anyone that values their self preservation will exist anywhere in the world, including Australia. After the gun ban in Australia, more people became victims cause they, the criminals, were emboldened, less afraid of their life being taken. From pro\\'s source \"It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States.\" Why? Cause the American people in vast numbers refuse to follow suit with such things as buybacks & registering. The mindset of Australians & Americans are different. There is historic evidence that Americans won\\'t rid themselves the right to bear arms cause a fraction of 1% of the population use their gun illegally & irresponsibly. You think the defiance would cease in the face of forced confiscation? That\\'s wishful thinking. \"This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently.\" Wild assertion, if that was the case, the US government, whom is actively bent on gun control, wouldn\\'t have funded it. My opponents attempt to rebut the facts that despite predictions of Kennesaw becoming a war zone after the law passed didn\\'t come to light. Crime rates reduced across the board after the law was passed, just as crime rates increased in other parts of the the US & world following bans including Australia. The only difference in crime rates before and after the ban in Australia, UK, Jamaica, ext was the ban, [8] so logic dictates that gun ownership is a major factor in the crime rates. Mexico, strict gun control is in a major war with their armed citizens whom are possession of them. [8] The United Kingdom, strict gun laws, regarded my dangerous nation in Europe, worse then the United States. [8] Gun ownership is considered an important crime deterrent. The police force in the United States doesn\\'t prevent crime, they just catch the criminals that commit the crime. Officers arrive after the fact, people must be able to protect themselves when those seconds matter then report the crime afterwards. There are 100s 1000s of animal attacks a year, millions of criminals committing crimes,without a gun every year, government abuse, I\\'ve seen in person, and increase risk of invasion. America\\'s superpower status is waning, China status of becoming a thing, as well as Russia. Tensions rising in world, America\\'s natural defenses of distance and geographic position is null in modern times. It may not happen within the nest 50 years but America wasn\\'t always the most powerful & its not logical to assume that we will away be most powerful. The right to bear arms was also established so that a foreign nation can\\'t invade & subject us to the types of harshness that the Nazis placed on those lands they occupied as well as against their own people. Or Japan\\'s Nanking Rape where national armies abandon the city leaving the people there with no means of defense. America is not immune to tyranny or invasion, the British ruled, they were pushed out but slavery existed, then gun control measures existed to prevent blacks from rising up and dealing with this tyranny. [9] The economic toll on America & whole states would be negatively affected. 300,000+ people would take a hit which can itself result in a desperate act of criminal activity. The voters need to place the affects of banning or not banning on a set of scales. This isn\\'t just a save lives measure cause there are aspects of American life that will be affected. Therefore any legit discussion involves all that would be involved. The people positively affected of gun ownership & people affected negatively. Looking at the facts, you\\'ll see that the positively affected outweighs the negative. The rights of 318 million Americans would be violated, cause of 500,000-1 million whom abuse their right. The former outweighs this here. Gun ownership is undeniably a crime deterrent, criminals will be criminals, removing the innocence ability to use the most efficient means of defense will result in increase crime. This will not protect the \\'general welfare\\' of the people. The economic toll on the US economy that is already $19 trillion in debt would severely hurt our ability to get out of debt faster, our already unemployment problem would get much worse. And peoples\\' ability to provide for their loved ones being negatively affected would result in desperate measure, not in the best interest of the United States or the general welfare of the people. The consequence of a government program to forcibly confiscate weapons from Americans would result in a vast defiance from the people. People would refuse to surrender their arms, as their historic counterparts had done in the past, & any attempt to put the people & the government into at odd in such a situation would, highly likely, result in the death of Americans both citizen & law enforcement in government. This is again, not in the best interest of the US government or the general welfare. [1] http://articles.latimes.com... [2] http://www.constitution.org... [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org...

[10] [11]', 'Freedom \"These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, & that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they\\'re represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, & the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law & has the right to life, liberty, & property. \" That is essentially my argument based on the rights of the people. Americans have a right to life, liberty, & property + pursuit of happiness. The government is constructed & its purpose is to protect those rights, among them, the 2nd amendment. Americans have a right to use their property, in this case guns, to protect their life, liberties, property, & pursuit of happiness. It is estimated that 1/3 to even 1/2 of the population own guns, that is 100-150 million people. [1] There is around 33,600 deaths by guns annually, includes accident, negligent, murder, & suicides. [2] That means that .0003% of the population did something resulting in a life taken, that also means that 99.9997% was accident free, no suicide or homicides. Legally, the other 99-149 million+ gun owners shall be free & the government has 0 reason to attempt to deny them of that right based on due process. Cause they have not committed a crime to warrant an arrest, placed on trail, & certainly not found guilty of trail by a jury of their peers. Furthermore, 90% of the people oppose a complete ban and confiscation. [3] So, from a legal & a freedom aspect, there should not be a gun ban. Gun bans don\\'t work Comparing pre & post gun ban crime rates for the UK, Ireland, Jamaica, & Australia, it tells you that the murder rates increased or was similar to pre gun ban. [4] [5] However, other crimes did indeed increase, the UK is considered the most dangerous nation in Europe, worse than the US & South Africa. [6] However, there is a law in Kennesaw GA, that requires heads of households to own a gun & crime rates have decreased, resulting in a murder free environment for 25 years, despite predictions that that American county would become the wild west. [7] Whereas, other counties enacting opposite laws have seen increases in crime rates. [8] Lets look at the most painfully obvious proof that gun ban doesn\\'t work... At our schools. The law abiding Americans accept this obviously proven mistake at great cost to, as you said, America\\'s future. Instead of allowing responsible people, I\\'m sure we agree that most teachers are responsible, whom owns a firearm to conceal carry, or the principle, or someone there to have access to their gun to defend the school against a potential intruders. Defense There are a multitude of potential threats the American people face. Animal attacks in the 100s of 1000s for just dogs [9], criminals, invasion, & tyrannical government. These threats are real, a ban & confiscation of firearms would result in much larger number of potential fatalities against animals, criminals would be embolden by their victims reduced chances, invasion of the United States could forget about strategic planning for the stiff resistance of the American people thanks to a ban, & the people would be forced to live under a government that controls the monopoly of force which is a very dangerous gamble to take. A famous quote comes to mind when I write this, \"Those that give up liberty for temporary safety will lose both & deserve neither\" Now for a comparison between legal defense gun uses vs illegal gun uses in crime. \" A 1995 study in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology based upon a 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone \"almost certainly would have been killed\" if they \"had not used a gun for protection.\" Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 162,000 such incidents per year. This figure excludes all \"military service, police work, or work as a security guard. \" [10] The estimated number of times guns are used in defense against a criminal range in the low 100,000-millions. Report from the CDC puts the number of times Americans used a gun to frighten an intruder away at about 500,000. [10] The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology estimates that the number of times guns are used in defense is over 1 million. [10] A 1982 survey of felons in prison concluded that 34% was scared off from a gun owner, 40% didn\\'t commit a crime out of a belief that the victim was in possession of gun, & 69% of them knew someone else that were scared off with a gun. [10] The lowest estimates of occasions that Americans use guns in defense is multiple times higher than they are used to murder. Average estimates are about the same number of times guns are used illegally, high estimates rivals or surpasses violent crimes. The CDC also concluded that gun ownership is an important crime deterrent. [11] Bad for the economy A ban on guns would result in a serious problem for the economy, there are over 155,000 workers that are good paying jobs in that industry. Even more workers that revolves around that industry. Those businesses provide near $7 billion in taxes, & near $50 billion to the economy. A ban would cause those people their jobs, assuming they have a families it easily affects 310,000 people not counting real possibility that they have children. [12] Entire states are dependent on the gun industries, the gun industry employs more people then GM. [13] To put it in a little perspective, America\\'s gun industries, if they were a nation, would rank around 82nd wealthiest nation in the world, there are 173 nations. [14] So the gun industry provides America with more money than half of the world\\'s nations can provide itself. Violence would ensue The American reaction towards a call of confiscation would be negative to say the least. As I said earlier in this round, 90% of Americans oppose a total gun ban & any attempt to confiscate them. A large % of Americans refuse to register their weapons. [15] [16] The last time authorities went on a hell bent mission of gun confiscation resulted in the \\'shot hear round the world\\' [17], I don\\'t imagine the reactions of freedom loving people in the United States would respond much differently. The people of the United States having been born & raised understanding that the 2nd amendment is the ultimate line of defense against tyranny, & knowing that when seconds truly matter, cops are minutes away. Americans will not quietly surrender what is considered the most important right the American people have. [1] http://bearingarms.com... [2] http://www.cdc.gov...

The positive effects of Christianity are listed below: Christianity is an advocate of human rights. In the Roman empire, infanticide was common, and it was legal to kill a child. [1] Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, was the one to finally outlaw it. [2] Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery. According to historian Glenn Sunshine, \"Christians were the first people in history to oppose slavery systematically. Early Christians purchased slaves in the markets simply to set them free.\" [3] In addition, two thirds of the American abolition society in 1835 were Christian ministers. [4] Martin Luther King Jr. was also a Christian minister, and he is a great example of a human rights supporter. [5] Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates. Christianity has been a leader in education because Bible literacy was so important to Christians. The first law to require education of citizens was passed by American Puritans in Massachusetts. [6] All but one of the first 123 American colleges were Christian institutions. The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible. The idea that all men are created equal is a biblical doctrine. [8] The notion of God\\'s authority is part of the Declaration of Independence and all 50 state constitutions. The preamble of the declaration states, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights...\". Christianity helped to make advancements in science. Many of the founders of modern science were Christians, such as Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, and Louis Pasteur.

I will list corrections to them below: 1. The Bible does not have to state that something is wrong in order for Christianity to teach that it is wrong. The Bible is not the \"book of rules\" for Christianity. Christians use the teaching of Jesus to determine what is right or wrong. [1] 2. People are not condemned to hell for sinning. People are condemned to hell for knowing and hating God. Many Christians even believe in Empty Hell Theory. [2] 3. The Old Testament is not considered to be infallible by Christianity. It contains Jewish teachings; Christians only use it as a source for the history of the Israelites, prophecies, Psalms, and some stories with good morals. The books of Exodus and Hosea are not Christian doctrine and are not entirely relevant to Christian beliefs. [3] 4. Two thirds is a lot. Most Americans in 1835 were not Christian ministers, so if most of an organization consists of Christian ministers, Christianity very likely has something to do with it. 5.

The Middle Ages produced classic literature such as \"Beowolf\" and \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", great architecture such as the many castles and cathedrals, and art such as stained glass windows that rival modern art. The Renaissance depended on the science and philosophy of what was apparently \"the dark ages\". Modern philosophy is built upon the work of medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, who was a devout Catholic monk educated at a Catholic university. In fact, the first universities were created by Catholics who valued education. Historians have even found that \"the Renaissance\" was improperly named; there were in fact three other ones on the Middle Ages. [1] I\\'m not even going to respond to that inaccurate picture you linked from a highly biased, unreliable, random blog. Wars As you have said, many Christians have gotten themselves killed for their faith. That is a lot like soldiers dying for our country. Our country has problems, many of its people die unnecessarily, but it is still a good thing. I and many other people are proud to be American despite the country\\'s corrupt laws and politicians, because it is still a young country and it is still trying to help people. The same could be said of Christianity. It has done bad, but it is trying to do good. That was an interesting link you posted. Let me respond to each part separately. Ancient Pagans Before you say that Christians are bad for killing pagans, first consider what the pagans did. They burned children alive as sacrifice, they allowed slaves to be mistreated, they dehumanized women and made them slaves of their husbands, they raped children, they killed Christians (that was probably their main motivation for killing pagans), and many other things. Being a pagan was rightfully seen as equivalent to being a murderer, a rapist, and a slave trader. [2] Mission Since you only showed two examples here, that shows how rare Christian corruption is. Remember what I said about wars. Crusades This was a war, so of course people died, and Christianity is not to blame. Muslims were oppressing Christians, and the Crusaders rescued them. [3] Atheists and Heretics All the examples here are a few corrupt Christians (although they were not really Christians) going against their religion. Witches This had nothing to do with Christianity. Religious Wars This is yet again Christians protecting Christianity from those who wish to harm it. Jews When Jews were harmed, it was either an unfortunate side effect of a war, a response to Jewish aggression, or a few corrupt bishops acting against their religion. Native peoples All the examples here are used as part of a huge cherry-picking fallacy. Many people believed that Native Americans were violent savages because many of them were, and stereotypes formed because of that. However, he is ignoring the Quakers who made peace with them and bought their land at a fair price, the Catholic missionaries who set up shelters and schools for the natives, and the French (most of them Christians) who traded with them and treated them equally with themselves. Extermination camps This had nothing to do with Christians. The so-called Christians who did this broke nearly all ten commandments in the process. This is also another cherry-picking fallacy; he ignores Maximillian Kolbe, a Catholic priest who was arrested for sheltering Jews and later volunteered to starve to death in place of a Jewish man (the Jewish man survived the camp). He also ignores the fact that Hitler discouraged going to church, and had many Christians killed for opposing him. I could go on and on things like this if I only had the time. Now I will respond to your last arguments: Judgment I am shocked by your ignorance on the subject. Muslims believe in God and we have had an atheist president (Abraham Lincoln). I will ignore everything you say here until you confirm your assumptions. False hope Christians do not think that God will do everything for them. They simply ask for help.

Therefore, Christianity caused the hanging of all those who died in the Salem witch trials.

If someone killed someone you love, would you not hope for them to be punished for it? Sure prison for life and the death penalty would be punishment, but I know a lot of people would want them to burn in hell. But you're saying if they got repent, they'll get a clean slate? That's an injustice in my eyes. The fact they will get to go to heaven after the horrible deed they committed just because they repented, seems very wrong to me. Also, the bible does have God teachings and Gods words in it, written by people who have dealt with God. However, saying God didn't teach all of its content is completely ignorant. False Hope: It is creating False Hope. Their is things we can do, such as donate money, provide help(resources,protection, ect.) to Paris, ect. You never argued against the offering once in any of your arguments. If you did, then I have overlooked it and I apologize, but I have yet to see where you have argued it. It is now up to the voters to decide who made the better case. Good job Pro, and thanks for the intriguing debate.\", 'Thanks for the intriguing argument. I\\'m going to rebut your arguments from Round 3 and 4, so please bear with me if I\\'m jumping from an argument you said one round to one in another. In your argument, you stuck up for the christians actions of war. The killing of people is by no means a positive, and you defending and saying it is dumbfounds me. The lost of any life, no matter the cause or reasoning, is a negative. You also said Christianity had nothing to do with witches. That is a false statement, as you can look at examples such as the infamous Salem Witch Trials. As for my Judgement argument, I shouldn\\'t have said Muslim, but you know what my notion was. Who would you feel to have to stand up every morning and praise something you don\\'t believe in? If that part is what you ask for confirmation, their truly is no need. You should be able to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue. Other than that, I see no other part of that argument that needs confirmation. As far as Abraham Lincoln benign atheist, their is no solid ground for that as many aren\\'t certain what he was. Until you give 100% proof he was atheist, your claim doesn\\'t stand, and mine does. In the false hope argument I stated that not all christians rely on God, but many do. They ask for help, but some rely to the point where they hope for a \"miracle\". I\\'m going to use the Paris attacks to help explain my case. What happened to Paris is completely inhuman. Many people from all around the world have showed their support. A trending hashtag for the last few days has been #PrayforParis. However, when people say this, what are they truly doing? Saying I\\'m praying for you is practically the same as saying I hope everything works out. You are not truly doing anything. By saying you are praying for them, you are relying on God to answer your prayer and to help the people of Paris. But unless you(or anyone else) don\\'t do anything, it won\\'t help them, therefore you have created a false hope. As far as me having misunderstandings, I\\'m afraid I have to disagree. I was a catholic for 16 years, and I thought I had a pretty good understanding of christianity. From what I\\'ve learned, the bible is how we are suppose to live our lives off. It\\'s teaches us about our creator and what he says, and I figured we should live off what he says. As far as not going to hell for sinning, I\\'m almost positive you do. By saying you don\\'t go to hell for sinning, that\\'s saying serial killers go to heaven with their victims. That\\'s ludicrous. Murder is a sin, and if you\\'re saying they don\\'t go to hell for committing sins(no matter how big or small), then what\\'s the point of having it? This would also add to my false hope argument, making the victims Families think the murdered will spend eternity in the depths of hell when actually they get to spend eternity with God. As far as the Old Testament being infallible: If a man murders a family, but is now a \"changed\" man(church going, compassionate, giving, charitable), he\\'s still a murderer. Even though he has changed, the murder and his past stay with him. Therefore, things from the Old Testament christians are trying to forget about are still with their religion. Saying that \"christianity makes someone more likely to be a good person\" is completely prejudice. Just because someone isn\\'t a christian doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t be a good person. By what you said, you\\'re saying atheist and other religions consists of not so good people. Considering you\\'re a christian, then I\\'m going to assume you got your views because of your biased belief, meaning christianity has given you prejudice beliefs, which is a negative. Once again, just because a person is christian and does something good, doesn\\'t mean you can give a positive to christianity, I stated several people who were successful who were atheists. Isaac Newton could have been an atheist and still made the discoveries he made, his religion had no affect in it. In addition, there is 45 more negatives on the site I listed below of my arguments that you completely ignored. Therefore, I would have presented more than one negative claim like you previously stated. http://www.patheos.com... In counting, I have presented atleast 43 negative arguments(I have presented more, but you have rebutted them and it is up to the voters to see if they think it\\'s a negative or not) as you agreed the offerings caused hardship to families, hurt scientific growth, and takes away from others, and then the 40 negatives on the site. Good luck to Pro in his concluding round. http://www.patheos.com...', 'I will rebuttal those claims in the next round, and rebuttal your arguments from the second round this round. Here are my rebuttals to arguments posted by pro in the second round: *Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates and *Christianity helped to make advancements in science Both of these claims are false. The time christianity ushered in greatness and superiority was the Dark ages, where we actually went backwards in advancement and became illiterate. As far as the scientists, their religious beliefs play no affect in their contributions to science, as it would not matter if they were atheist or a different religion. *The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible This just proves my point of how the United States is favoring Christianity and breaking people\\'s first amendment right AND the separation of church and state. *Christianity is an advocate of human rights In your very own words you stated that, \"Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery\" In the Bible, the most prestigious book in a christians view, talks about owning a slave. If slavery was wrong, the bible would say it is wrong and anyone who did it was condemned to hell. However, it does not, and actually informs us what to do with the slave. Therefore, it does not think slavery is bad, and actually guides us to be better slave owners. Now it is possible some christians set them free, but if they were truly devote christians they would follow what the bible says, and the bible says, Exodus 21:20-21 \"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money [property]. \" You went on to say how 2/3 of the American Abolition society were Christian ministers. What about the other 1/3 then? Just because you are christian doesn\\'t mean you are automatically a great person. An atheist, Muslim, Jew, Buddist, ect, can be as good and even a better person as a Christian. You also talk about infanticide, and how the Christian Roman emperor finally outlawed it. In the Bible, God talks about slaughtering children. \"The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open. \"(Hosea 13:16) You can find more verses, like God ordering moses to slaughter babies, at this site . http://www.patheos.com... agree.

This time was called the Dark Ages\" -Richard Lederer The Dark Ages referred to the period of time ushered in by the fall of the Western Roman Empire. This took place when the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by Odoacer, a barbarian. AD 476 was the time of this event. This era takes on the term \"dark\" due to the backward ways and practices that seemed to prevail during this time. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Men and women sought after God; some through the staid rituals of the Catholic Church. Intellectuals view religion in any form as, itself, a type of \"darkness.\" These thinkers assert that those who followed religious beliefs lied to themselves, creating a false reality. They were dominated by emotions, not fact. Religion was seen as contrary to rationality and reason, thus the move towards enlightenment -- a move away from \"darkness.\" Science and reason gained ascendancy, progressing steadily during and after the Reformation and Age of Enlightenment. As you can see above, religion hindered are progression in science,literature,math, and other subjects that if we avoided this we could be extremely more advanced than we are today. This link goes to a picture showing the drop in technology during the Dark ages http://3.bp.blogspot.com... 2.Wars While many believe Christianity promoted peace, it actually has brought great damage. Not only has it affected it\\'s followers, with believers and even his disciples being crucified, burned, ect. for believing in Christianity, and even today with 100 millions christians being prosecuted for their faith. It has also impacted other people, as it has brought wars and slaughterings. Tons of examples can be found at this site http://articles.exchristian.net... Also, at this site, http://addictivelists.com... it list 10 biggest religious wars ever fought, and Christianity and its denominations(catholic) are involved with around 5 of them. 3.The offering At church(Atleast for Catholic Churches) they go around asking for offerings(money donations). The church wants you to give 10% of your works pay that week towards the church. Some people aren\\'t wealthy enough to just give 10%, but some will do it anyways. This could lead to a financial burden to the family/individual. Also, the donations do not count as tax deductions, so no benefits go to the donator in that sense. Think about the money donated. If all of that money was donated to a charity how many lives it would impact. Think about if it was given to St.Judes or another organization similar to that, how many lives it would save and help further medicine. Church taking the offering is putting a burden on struggling families and the growth of medicine/well being of others. 4.Judgement Let me ask you, what is the ... Amendment? It\\'s the Freedom of Religion. However, it is no secret we support Christianity. With 77% of our citizens being Christians, it is the most dominant religion by a extravagant margin. Because of this, our nation has put christianity and made it part of our society and government, breaking our amendment and the separation of church and state. They put in our currency and in our Pledge of Alligence. Tell me, how would you feel being a Muslim having to say \"One nation, under God...\"? You would feel like a minority. With everything around you, including your government, supporting a religion, you almost feel obligated and self conscious about your own personal belief, and feeling as if you need to change. This is violating a persons belief and amendment. Also, another demonstration on how Christianity runs our government is how no atheist have been President of the United States. On this poll http://www.gallup.com... it shows how people will less likely vote for an atheist than any other option. An atheist, no matter how good a politician, is less likely get elected, taking away their job opportunities. Christianity is making the land of the free every judgmental. 5.False hope For many, christianity is hope. It\\'s assurance that no matter how tough the times are, things will get better. Yet the harsh reality is, it\\'s uncertain there is a God. And if there is no good, then chances of your situation getting better become more slim. Take, for example, a man who just lost his job. He prays for everything to get better, and for God to help him. He is hopeful as his omnipotent omnibenevolent God will surely help him, yet he is devastated as loses his house. His hope turned into false hope, which led to no hope. For some, they rely too much on this hope, and won\\'t do anything as they feel God will do it for them. Along with that, I found a site listing 40 harmful effects of Christianity http://www.patheos.com... So in total, that is 45 negatives to Christianity.

The school is a gun-free zone for a reason. http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com... (This source is linked to police shootings but can easily be applied to any situation) 2. Intimidation Students may feel intimidated or threatned with the very notion of a gun near them. I am a high school student myself and lockdown drills (Drills where a shooter is in the school) make some kids very scared, one even passed out.

Talking can be a greater weapon than a gun If a student or an intruder comes into your classroom pulling your gun will not only endanger you but the children as well in the classroom. Pulling guns on people makes them even more enraged and can lead to a massacre if you aren't the fastest trigger puller.

It is Unsanitary This link states that \"To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others\" (https://en.wikipedia.org...). In other words, if getting in close contact does these things then it is dangerous for a person to even consider having sex with a dead person. These diseases could then be further spread when the necrophiliacs encounter with other people. 2. It is Immoral Not only does this disrespect the dead (when they have permission or not), but it is a practice that is highly immoral. Having sex with the dead does absolutely nothing good. It only causes harm to the necrophiliacs mental state and it causes diseases to spread. The only thing it does is satisfy some creeps desire to have sex with a dead course. I can guarantee that the majority of people will not be interested in allowing some creep to have special privileges especially since the practice causes harm to society. 3. If you legalize this for the reasons mentioned you could also legalize pedophilia (https://www.google.com...). Are you aware that there is a movement for pedophiles to have the same rights as homosexuals (http://www.greeleygazette.com...)? These ideas about legalization are so bad that I couldn\\'t have made it up. Your arguments could literally be used to support pedophilia. As long as the children agree to what happens and as long as it is deemed as safe, it should be legal. Don\\'t you understand how messed up your argument is? The line has to be draw somewhere. Most of the time we make decisions on what benefits society. Since Necrophilia and pedophilia only (sort of) benefits some creeps and not the society as a whole, it should not be legal. Refuting your arguments: a. Economic Benefit? You make a huge assumption with this point. You assume that there are enough people out there that want their bodies to be molested by some creep after they die. I can assure you that most people don\\'t want this to happen. The business\\' would fail because the majority of people wouldn\\'t want necrophilia to be legalized. Normal people don\\'t want to have sex with dead people. You also need to provide some evidence that this would benefit the economy. b. Happiness Benefits? This sure wouldn\\'t make me happy. The only people it would make happy are the lunatics that want to have sex with dead people. But legalizing it would cause unhappiness to society since it causes diseases to spread. And furthermore, the governments main focus (if at all) is not on the happiness of the people. Governments have to think of the society as a whole and not just on the very few people out there that want special privileges. You also make the assumption that there will be many people would be willing to pay for such a service.', 'I have a feeling this is going to be a fun one.', 'In order to win this debate, I have to prove that necrophilia should be legalized. I do not have to prove that every instance of necrophilia should be legalized, just that it should be under certain circumstances. Outline: Under my plan to legalize necrophilia it will be legal under the following circumstances: 1-Permission was given by either the dead person prior to their death or by their family to be used for sex after they die. 2-The body is preserved, the same way bodies are before burial and thrown out if deemed unusable. (1) Now that has been established, I’ll enter my arguments. C1-Economic Benefits This is simple. The majority of people who would be willing to have their or their family’s corpse for sexual reasons would need some sort of incentive. Incentive wise, this will probably be financial. This means that a business will probably have to be formed dedicated to necrophilia and people would have to pay for it. This will create economic growth, because it will create jobs needed to preserve the body and could be a quite profitable industry. The extent to which this will create economic growth is unknown, but it likely will occur. C2-Happiness Benefits Legalizing necrophilia would increase happiness. If people are willing to pay for necrophilia, it is clearly something they want. Governments obviously want their people to be happy and necrophilia can bring pleasure to people (while not harming anyone). Everyone knows people like sex and necrophilia can be an easy way to get sex, for people who may otherwise have trouble doing so. Plus, many people have sexual fantasies of various types and necrophilia opens up the opportunity for that. However, even if some people don’t understand it, it need not be understood to know it increases happiness for people paying for it. If anyone wishes to pay for something, they deemed it worthwhile. Pretty much everyone values money (to at least some degree), so anyone willing to part with it felt that they would receive something better. Thus, anyone who would pay for necrophilia would see it as worthwhile way to spend their money and believe it is a positive impact and therefore it increases their happiness. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *This argument was pretty short and to the point, but I imagine Con will have a lot to rebut with, so I’ll have more to say in rebuttals and defense.* Source: 1-http://www.afif.asso.fr...', 'Resolution is self-explanatory (necrophilia being sex with a human corpse). Rules:1. No forfeits2. No new arguments in the final round3. First round is acceptance only4. No trolling5. No kritiks6. Violation of rules results in automatic loss.', 'Ok! Thank you for your answer once again. The information seems to be quite interesting. I\\'ve watched some videos about Kristina Golovchenko. Though I believe this case has nothing to do with The Body Positive Movement - Kristina just requires some medical and psychological help. She doesn\\'t even love her body, right? Thus, the case represents a perfect example for my first argument, which was health. Besides, I agree with you that \"there is something in us that needs to be accepted\" though I\\'ve already mentioned it above claiming that \"self-acceptance is a long road.\" Like self-acceptance, tolerance is something that need to be learnt.However, let us go back to the Body Positive Movement. And here goes my third argument, which is FASHION. I explain it below. I will try to be as brief as possible.On the one hand, there are some people who like to show off. On the other hand, there is social trends (such as The Body Positive) that provokes a disruptive social reaction. As a result, people who aim at drawing public attention use these social trends in their own selfish way. For instance, some girls cease shaving their legs and armpits only to post the hairy body parts photos on Instagram etc. People sometimes do stupid things just to show off. The Body Positive Movement here works as an instrument of crime. I do not want to say that showing off is a crime (an instrument of crime is just a figure of speech). Still, we should be careful with such peculiar trends and shouldn\\'t cross the line of prudence unless we want be freaks of course. Besides, people shouldn\\'t follow all the trends blindfold. Fashion changes but a bit of critical thinking is never too much.Considering my third argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'To begin with, thank you for your answer. I find your arguments quite curious. I agree with you that The Body Positive was meant to serve for solely positive goals. Still, as I\\'ve already said above something went wrong. Thus, I can\\'t agree with you completely. So here goes my second argument, which is JUSTIFICATION. I suggest to take a look at the argument, considering two major aspects of each person\\'s life: self-acceptance and self-improvement.Firstly, I insist that self-acceptance is a long road. Even Rome wasn\\'t built in a day therefore it may take you years and years to make the skin you\\'re in better. Self-acceptance is a winding road. It requires direct action including physical exercises, medical intervention, psychological training and so forth. No one disputes that perfection is unreachable. Still, it doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t try. They say practice makes perfect. I say action makes perfect. Self-improvement is a continuous process that shapes our personality, making us stronger and boosting our confidence. Conversely, The Body Positive Movement claiming that \"Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL\" may serve as a justification for inaction.Secondly, there is a well-known fact that some people are lazy, weak or simply indifferent. They simply lack initiative or boldness to take action. Therefore, some Body Positive ideas including your argument \"The <...> movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities.\" may serve as a justification for indifference. Such concept make you calm down, sit down and be happy with what you get. Personally I suppose that people should not stand still. Conversely, I suggest that self-improvement constitutes an essential part of every person\\'s life. Unlike self-acceptance, self-improvement is a road without an end. Seneca once said that Vivere militāre est which meant to live is to struggle. Now let me paraphrase it saying that to live is to develop as self-improvement is a struggle as well. Considering my second argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'Perhaps, many people have heard something about the recent trend - The Body Positive Movement. At first the movement seems to be completely healthy. What could be wrong with accepting your body as it is? Still, the question is not as simple as it may seem. The concept of the Body Positive is often misinterpreted. Such misinterpretations are fatal not only for a single person, but also for a whole society. Therefore I insist that the movement can\\'t be called positive. And here goes my first argument, which is HEALTH.Firstly, you can accept your body as long as it\\'s healthy. I believe there are some things that can\\'t be accepted. Moreover, there are some problems that can\\'t be solved by simple acceptance. For instance, health problems. The thing is that by chance particular health problems affect our appearance, thus causing lack of self-confidence and making the unhealthy person disgusting for other people. To solve the problems person should consult a doctor, which sometimes represent another problem due to psychological and economic factors.Secondly, I\\'m convinced that one can\\'t make himself or herself love his or her body simply saying \"Ok, I accept myself as I am because each body is perfect\" It\\'s a delusion. It\\'s a self-suggestion. It\\'s a placebo. Time spent on worthless declarations and exclamations may negatively affect your condition leading to the health aggravation. On the contrary, to love your body means to respect your body. To respect your body means to take care of your body.Finally, I believe The Body Positive Movement represents a radical reaction to another recent trend which is plastic surgery. While the 2nd variant helps you achieve fake perfection with an operating knife, the 1st one denies perfection as it is. And as a result, it cuts both ways. These two variants only create the illusion of self-confidence. The Body Positive, just as plastic surgery, works for those who refuse to take direct action. Besides, both are unhealthy. People tend to see things in black and white. Why couldn\\'t we see the shades of grey? Or - what is even better - why couldn\\'t we mix them up with more vivid colours?Considering my first argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'I understand you perfectly. I share your opinion that it is necessary to work on ourselves. and we must do this, so as not to justify our flaws in appearance. But what about those people who, for example, have burns all over their body, the most terrible form of acne, which can not be eliminated even by the beauticians of Hollywood, or a psychological dependence on food in connection with a child trauma due to rape (for example - Kristina Golovchenko). Sometimes there is something in us that needs to be accepted, because people are not almighty - they are sometimes really powerless.', 'MEDIA makes us believe that there is something wrong with our bodies. After all, companies and organizations gain greatly when women waste millions on diet fads and untouched gym memberships, when those women could save hundreds by being comfortable in their own skin. The body positivity movement is about health, identity and self-respect. Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL. The appreciation of curves and physical diversity reduces fat-shaming, bulimia, anorexia, depression and bullying among women everywhere, based on the fact that it\"s about acceptance. The body positive movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities. A great way to talk about what body positivity is, is to talk about what it isn\"t. It isn\"t about eroticizing or sexualizing, nor is it about tolerance\" it\"s about softening the frown of superficiality, and revisiting points in history where women were praised for curvaceousness outside of a subgroup.', 'YO LISTEN UP NIGGAZZ MY ESSAY IS BOUT TO DOW DOWN YO.... http://www.youtube.com...1, 2, 3, on the page I write my poetry,This is meant ot be an essay but I structure it stupidly,The writer of the worst essay is me that\\'s too easy to see,It\\'s like a mystical, beast that came in the midst of a bunch of sexy... mother? sister? grandmothers?... sh!t dude...

This fear is not illogical. Plane/drone collisions are possible (though not frequent, if existent), and have lately come closer to colliding than other times. [1]However, the Pro argues that drone should be completely and utterly illegal, which I strongly disagree with. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sets rules and regulations as to who and what are allowed in the big blue sky; and they are seemingly coming closer to an agreement on approving drones above. [2]As the Con, I am arguing that drones should not be illegal in the USA, but rather that the FAA aproves drone use with the given rules and regulations. I do believe there are limits to what drones should be able to do, however, they are generally beneficial and should not be outlawed in this country.[1]: http://www.washingtonpost.com...[2]: http://www.usatoday.com...', 'I want to start off by thanking the Pro for the debate.Also, because there are only three rounds in this debate, I will go ahead and lay out my main points.I will be arguing that drones should not be illegal, and here are my reasonings.The definition of a \"drone\": \"an unmanned aircraft or ship that can navigate autonomously,without human control or beyond line of sight:\"[1]This includes all drones, including UAVs (figure 1.) and camera drones (figure 2.) Figure 1. UAV Reaper Drone [2] Figure 2. Camera Drone. [3]Because the Pro does not specify which drones, I will argue for them all. Despite what Pro states in his opening thesis, drones can actually be extremely beneficial in many ways.1: Drones aide in saving lives. Immediately after natural disasters in which the damage is not yet determined, drones can be used to easily assess the amount of damage and find out the level of danger, and acts as a safe alternative to sending in first responders.2: Drones help in agricultural management. Farmers can use drones specifically to manage crops and pinponts areas that need special attention. This way saves time by only providing care exactly where needed, and improves crop yield.3: Help safely in architechtural maintenance and inspection. Drones can obviously go places where humans cannot, and can also do it without risking lives. For example, drones would easily help inspect places of infrastructure such as below bridges and high buildings.4: Drones give the media access to places: They can film places never reached before, for news and film production. This can be done easily, efficiently, and safely, thanks to drones.Because of my limited time, I will limit my arguments to those above and wait for the Pro to present his. I look forward to this debate and the rebuttals along with it.

I knew it would be something like that. You don't even know what you're saying, do you? You're a lost mind in a simple world. That's why I like debating with you, sir. I always win, because you continuously fail to provide any sources. We are not going to kill 350 million people for the polar bears. It would be roughly the population of the United States and Australia. But if we killed that many people, the United States and Australia would have far less people and we would be worse off because we would have labor shortages, the people would rebel against their government for killing all the depressed people, and the like. There are cheaper, more humane, efficient ways to deal with global warming, like solar, wind, nuclear, and so on. We do not need to kill everybody to stop global warming. Humans are not the problem, the problem is how we produce energy. If you actually cared about global warming, it would be nice. But you don't you just use global warming as a way to express how you hate 95% of all the people on Earth. Actually, though, we could kill all the white supremacists and hate groups. That would help. I ask you, sir, in the comments, to give me just ONE source, one graph or chart which shows that global warming is brought about by the farts of pessimistic people. I doubt you'll be able to.

Many great comedians have low self esteem, that's why they became comedians. Stand up comedy is a kind of mental therapy. Everybody has low self esteem at some point in their lives, we should not have to hide our emotions. When emotions are suppressed, and people only feel happiness, and the happiness is being forced, then that person is not happy. Many people with depression have jobs, stupid, boring jobs, and that's why they're depressed. They're depressed because they're contributing to society. We should change society so people are less depressed. We should make life more fun. Then they wouldn't be depressed anymore. We should allow more pay, shorter work hours, more career diversity. We should make life better for them, not worse. What kind of sick monster ARE you? You said that 350 million people suffer from depression. Killing them would be killing a lot of people. Then more people would be depressed about the people they killed. Sadness is a part of life. We cannot eliminate it. We can only turn our society into a smiling utopia by embracing sadness as a reality. To Hell with your polar bears. Polar bears are not affected by overpopulation, they're affected by CO2 emissions. We need to stop emitting CO2. Then polar bears would be fine. I'm sure some polar bear scientists have depression. And what about the penguins of the walruses? Do you care about them? Or just your stupid POLAR BEARS WE ARE NOT GOING TO COMMIT MASS GENOCIDE UPON ALL MINORITIES TO SAVE ONE ANIMAL What do you think about grizzly bears? Do you hate them for the color of their fur?

Think about it: if the United States and Australia never existed, there would be much more polar bears in today's world. People who are depressed are always paranoid and sad. Paranoid and sad people are always pessimists. Statistics have shown that pessimists fart too much, which is also bad for the environment.

People with low self-esteem are useless people who achieve nothing and are useless to society.

Below are some statistics about depression: https://www.healthline.com... 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. 350m/7b=5% So 1 in every 20 people suffer from depression. To put this into perspective, only 1 in 200 people are redheads, so depression is much more common than you think. America is the 3rd most populated country in the world, currently at a population of about 324 million.

Here is how it will work: Round 1: Acceptance Rounds 2/3: Debate Here we go! Number 4!', 'Thank you as well for offering the topic - I enjoyed it!', 'My opponent’s argument breaks down at step 2. The Taylor expansion for ln(x) has a radius of convergence of 1, around the point x = 1, such that 0<x<2 (as opposed to 0≤x≤2) as I will show below, meaning that the Taylor expansion of ln(x-1) likewise has a radius of convergence of 1 around the point x = 0, such that -1<x<1. By inserting x=1 into the Taylor expansion for ln(x-1), he is causing the series to become divergent, thereby inducing the error in the proof that appears to make 2=1. Proof that the Taylor expansion for ln(x+1) fails at x=1: 1) Differentiating ln(1+x), we have: d/dx (ln(1+x)) = 1/(1+x). 2) Trivially, 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-(-x)) = 1/(1-y), where y≡-x. 3) Taking the Maclaurin expansion of 1/(1-y), we have: 1/(1-y) = 1+y+y^2+y^3+y^4+… 4) Note that the result in step 3 is the expression of a geometric series, which has limits of evaluation at |y|<1. Since y≡-x, |y|<1 is equivalent to |-x|<1. Substituting 1 for x, we have |-1|=1<1, which is false, since 1=1 (again, note the difference between 1<1 and 1≤1). For example, substituting x=1 into the previous expression yields: 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-y) = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+1+(-1)+… This expression is divergent, resulting in the error that causes 2 to appear to equal 1. This concludes the proof.****************************************************************************I greatly enjoyed this debate; you’ll have to challenge me to another some time!', \"I accept this challenge - it'll be nice to actually be able to argue mathematics on here for once, since I've tried starting quite a few math debates before.

Extend this out as a reason why drone strikes aren\\'t working, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.My opponent also never responds to the second Blum et. al card talking about how drone striking terrorist leaders hurts our intelligence gathering abilities, which harms out abilities to stop terrorist plots long-term. Extend this out for why drone strikes hurt our ability to fight terrorism, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.She also never responds to the Hunter card talking about how drone striking terrorist leaders actually doesn\\'t significantly hamper terrorist activities. Extend this out for a reason why drone strikes don\\'t actually work, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.Also, extend out the Speigel Online card talking about how killing one terrorist with drone strikes took sixteen attempts and cost 321 innoncent lives just to get one terrorist. She responds to this by just saying that it\\'s \"collateral damage\" necessary to stop terrorism, but a) we don\\'t even need to be fighting terrorism right now, refer back to the Mueller evidence which says that more people die from drowning in their own bathtubs than from terrorist attacks, and b) just brushing off the deaths of 321 innocent people as \"collateral damage\" doesn\\'t actually justify the use of drones. We shouldn\\'t be contenting ourselves with a faulty method of offing terrorist leaders. We need a method that takes out the man we want to take out and only the man we want to take out on the first try. If it\\'s taking sixteen tries and costing hundreds of innocent lives just to take out one leader, that\\'s not #worth, that\\'s inefficient and ineffective. We need to stop drone striking and come up with something better, not justify the murder of innocent lives as \"necessary for the safety of America\". All of these independantly work to show how Drone striking doesn\\'t work and only makes things worse for us, which shows that we shouldn\\'t be using drone strikes for modern warfare. If we shouldn\\'t be using drone strikes for modern warfare, they certainly aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare. Then, my opponent doesn\\'t respond to a single claim I make in my second argument. Extend out the Mueller evidence which is showing how terrorism really isn\\'t something to worry about right now because more people are dying from drowning in the tub than from acts of terror, showing how unnecessary drone strikes are right now. She also never responds to my alternative to drone striking, which is to send a small detachment of US special forces to support the local Pakistani military to limit cross-border travel and to help train local forces to better combat terrorism. This a) works to stop terrorism over the long-term, which means it\\'s going to work better than the ineffective drone striking, and b) meets her criteria of not letting American soldiers die because it\\'s putting them in a supportive role, meaning they won\\'t be in the line of fire. This means that my alternative is better by my criteria as well as hers. So, to put it simply: my opponent doesn\\'t really respond to anything I said in the last round, rather just restates her own points. My points are a direct counter to her points. Extend them out. I win.', 'Thanks to pro for starting this debate. I intend to attack the resolution from two different angles:1. That targeted killings are actually effective. If they\\'re ineffective, then there would be no reason to employ them in modern warfare, thus making them not necessary.2. That drone attacks are necessary to conduct modern warfare. If there are other avenues of waging warfare other than using UAVs/Drones, then they aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.With that let\\'s dive right into things.Argument One: Targeted Killings don\\'t actually work/make things worse. Killing a terrorist leader causes more to grow and retaliate. Hezbollah empirics prove. Blum et. al(1) \"eliminating leaders of terrorist organizations ... may ... effect, the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace them. The decapitating of the organization may also invite retaliation by the other members and followers of the organization. ... when Israel assassinated ... Mussawi ... a more charismatic and successful leader, ... Nassrallah, succeeded ... The armed group then avenged the assassination of its former leader in two separate attacks, blowing up Israeli and Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, ...\" Targeted killing which relies on intelligence hurts the ability of the government to gain intelligence on terrorists. Blum et. al(1) \"Targeted killing may also interfere with important gathering of critical intel ... The threat of being targeted will drive current leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their ... activities ... difficult. ... if these leaders are found and killed, instead of captured, ... counterterrorism forces lose the ability to interrogate them to obtain potentially valuable information ...\" Really big and strong terrorist groups are not affected by targeted killing empirically. Hunter(3) \"attempting to reduce a group’s operational capabilities through targeted killing is of limited utility when posed against groups practicing advanced security measures. ... to ensure al Qaeda’s operational effectiveness, the group stresses the need to maintain internal security, dividing its operatives into overt and covert members functioning under a single leader…al Qaeda’s global network has survived by its members strictly adhering to the principles of operational security. the continued “success” of al Qaeda (measured in its ability to conduct major terrorist attacks worldwide despite international efforts to eradicate it) is a testament to its members’ adherence to operational security. ... this ongoing viability is evidence of the ineffectiveness of targeted killing (as practiced by the U.S. in this case) ...\" In trying to kill one man, drones killed approximately 321 people, from Spiegel Online(5) \"What is the cost of rendering a terrorist harmless once and for all by killing him? During the course of 14 months, the CIA used unmanned and heavily armed small aircraft known as drones to stage 15 strikes against the presumed locations of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. On Aug. 5, 2009, on the 16th try, the drones finally managed to kill Baitullah Mehsud. ... and 11 others were killed. ... But the hunt for Mehsud cost the lives of far more than 11 people. According to estimates, ... 321 people died in the course of the 16 attempts to eliminate Mehsud -- and it is certain that not all of them were Taliban fighters.\" Argument Two: Drone Attacks aren\\'t necessary/Other avenues of warfarePost 9/11 Terrorist attacks are overrated – more people die from drowning in bathtubs. Mueller(2) \"Two publications ... have independently provided lists of violence committed by Muslim extremists outside of such war zones ... whether that violence be perpetrated by domestic terrorists or by ones with substantial international connections. ... The lists include not only attacks by al-Qaeda, but also those by its imitators, ... as ones by groups with no apparent connection to it whatever. ... the total number of people killed in the five years after 9/11 in such incidents comes to some 200-300 per year. ... it hardly suggests that al-Qaeda\\'s destructive capacities are monumental. ... over the same period far more people have perished in the United States alone in bathtubs drownings ...\"Alternative to Drone strikes: Support and Cooperate with Pakistani security forces, Innocent(4)\"A better strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is for the United States to focus on limiting cross-border movement by supporting local Pakistani security forces with a small number of US Special Forces personnel. To improve fighting capabilitiesand enhance cooperation, Washington and Islamabad must increase the number of military-to-military training programs to help hone Pakistan\\'s counterterrorism capabilities and serve as a confidence-building measure to lessen the Pakistan Army\\'s tilt toward radicalism.\" As such, I\\'ve shown that not only do drone strikes not work, not only that they make things worse, but also that we have no need for drone strikes right now and that there are other options for combating terror outside of drone strikes.

For some at least one factor was the consideration of the hundreds thousands of Iraqi and Afghanistan people died and suffered over near to the length of a generation. These same people could also be expected to be angered by the death of our own sons and daughters, friends and family, who sacrifice their lives, physical and mental well being, to serve the Country's interests. The majority though lose sleep over the death of the innocents not counted as our allies and brethren. They are collateral damage, necessary to keep America and our children safe. That what we are told, not just by Fox News, but by the other major networks as well. Imagine a world where people who had the same financial interests in the military industrial complex were also heavily invested in the mass media. Welcome to it. The drones remove a large number of our soldiers from harms way to carry out certain missions, or executions, as the case may be. This is good, we don't want our soldiers to die, and could any ethical or moral reason be good enough to surmount that? It depends how the drones are used of course, but those who control them are those in power, and those in power usually, historically speaking, probably don't have the best interests of the people at heart. Not really. Not the people beyond the sphere of their family, friends and co workers, or their bubble, to be precise. They might believe they do, but that to better sleep at night. Argument 2: Drones are always necessary. Its a more effective way to destroy our target then actually going out there and risking there life's. You say if we had drones that we wouldn't have soldiers, in fact they could be National guard which is almost the same thing but instead they are in their hometown helping out,\", \"I would like to start of by just saying I have great respect for our military and we have lost many soldiers due to man-to man war. More soldiers die fighting face to face then actually drones that due the job. So why send our troops into war and risk their life's when sending in a nuclear drone, which wont take our soldiers life's but take down the target.\", \"Kids should definetly have cell phones.

Kids need to be social in order for them to develope correct social skills and learn how to act around people.

REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human Again, all my opponent has argued here is that the potential life inside the woman’s womb is part of the species homo sapiens, and that it will evolve and eventually become a human being. But again, is this enough to justify on illegalizing abortion? No. My opponent dismisses my ‘sentience’ argument because it is a failed theory and unnecessary. It isn’t, that’s why embryos/fetuses have no rights in the first place. I will focus on the sentience and consciousness, which the embryo has not. My opponent states that my theory of the embryo having no sentience relates to a person in a coma. Two things, first, embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because personhood is defined by the state). Second, a person in a coma was obviously already born, and with legal rights thus making him a human being. Let’s take a look at the ‘bear’ scenario my opponent gave in R2; where one man mistakes a person for a bear thus shooting him and killing him accidentally. Now, even though we can say that the benefit of the doubt will go life, we still wouldn’t consider this action to become a killing of an innocent person (i.e.: murder). Why? Because the man thought he was shooting a bear (which can be a danger to him), rather than a real, sentient human. Relating to abortion, if we outlaw most abortions, and when a woman and her doctor think they're killing a non-viable being, they would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, but it’s hard to judge someone criminally negligent for not personally believing that a pre-sentient embryo is a viable person when we don't actually know this to be the case. There isn’t any sufficient evidence to prove that an embryo is a human being in mind. If we’re following PRO’s logic on embryo being humans, then abortion would be tragic and lethal and should result to murder in all cases, there should be no exceptions, meaning that this will result to many bad consequences. As for it being just and moral, I will address my opponent’s Spiegel argument and morality rebuttal in my Utilitarianism defense below, but to his statement saying, “To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust.”, If I may ask, dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? I’ve already addressed this issue and my opponent hasn’t fully accurately backed this claim up. Please extend my previous rebuttal and the arguments regarding the advantage of abortion and the disadvantage of back alley abortions on the economy. Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. Re: Hippocratic Oath Violation 4 Issues: All arguments from this source {10}. 1) This oath is obsolete and irrelevant since it is historically taken by physicians. This oath is also invalid since it’s a stretch to even argue it. 2) This oath is not binding by law, there is no law required that forces doctors to take this when performing abortion. So what if they break it? 3) Non-doctors perform abortions too. ‘Nuff said. 4) Quoted oath is false. The quoted statement my opponent cited is from the original version, which has already been modernized. And performing an abortion isn’t stated in it. ERGO) This argument is false, invalid and irrelevant. DEFENSE/CASE De: Morality My opponent dismisses this argument stating that it is irrelevant and that I have the BOP. But please note that PRO made this argument first (but forgot to put it in R2), so it’s already proven that killing innocent humans can be morally permissible, and that an embryo is NOT a killing of an innocent human being. Now, to address his rebuttal: Okay, let’s say that contraceptives failed, thus the woman woke up pregnant. It was the woman’s intention to use birth control and wished not have a life attached her, but it failed. Thus making this Utilitarianism argument very much valid. There are also cases where women are morons, they are promiscuous and do not know the outcomes of having sex, we shouldn’t let the woman and the baby suffer. Actually no, there are different kinds of pregnancies {11} which can complicate and danger the woman’s everyday life, like Ectopic pregnancies, RH negative diseases, Group B Strep, Gestational Diabetes, etc. These illnesses limit the woman’s ability to do things, work, shop, take care of stuff. De: Fetus =/= Legal Human I’ve already proven why a fetus is not a human and that the ‘coma’ argument is blatantly false. I’ve also argued why fetuses shouldn’t receive or be considered human. Extend. De:Fetus not really innocent This relates to my morality argument. De: Violates Rights OK, I apologize. I haven’t read the definitions accurately. But the ‘rights’ I’m talking about here are not only legal, but moral, universal or God-given rights that are being violated. In a Utilitarianist view, we need to consider on what is morally permissible and we must consider what the best interest of the mother and child is. Right to choose & to have dignity: Women should have the right to be respected by society, if they do not want children that should be respected. Again, there are cases where birth control fails, where women do not know the outcomes of having children. Most of these women are mostly in poverty where they couldn’t economically handle having a child. {12}. Mothers are responsible for their children, we need to value their right on what they think is safer and right for their children and environment. Do you want children to live in the streets, to suffer and live with abusive parents? De: Crime Yes, this is a US-only debate. I’m introducing the NYT source as pattern evidence. My opponent counters this argument by citing a source from a book, thus must be considered unreliable, I don’t normally attack sources that way but it’s crucial to what we’re arguing. Now, to further clarify abortion=crime correlation; I will quote what I said in the previous round; Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {9}. That source also states that and I quote, “Many women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to self-induce their abortions or going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. During this time, hospital emergency room staff treated thousands of women who either died or were suffering terrible effects of abortions provided without adequate skill and care.” Now, obviously, illegalizations have no effect due to that source, also this that statement wasn’t accurately refuted by PRO. About my NYT source, please note that the WHO did a research (in countries where abortion is illegal) where they found out that 20 million unsafe abortions are performed per year & 67K of those women die, and between 2 -7 million of these risky abortions result in long-term damage or illnesses. This is only a pattern or what might happen to the US if we illegalize abortion due to back-alley abortion {8}. My opponent needs to prove that illegalizing is more beneficial to society regardless of back-alley abortions where criminals profit more than the state, where mothers have more health risks and are endangered. CITATIONS http://www.debate.org...\", \"Thanks for responding. REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human My opponent first noted that he’ll focus on the fetus because most abortions happen in the fetal period. This is false, since he didn’t give a source, I’d like to point out that 9 in 10 abortions in the US occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy {1a} {1b}. That means that the fetus isn’t fully developed yet {2}, which means that the pregnancy is still in its embryonic period {3a}. An embryo is not (yet) a fetus and it’s also not a person and therefore doesn’t have rights. The embryo is not viable or sentient, it cannot survive outside the uterus/womb {3b} so it would be ridiculous to grant them rights. As for his argument on fetuses being human, as you can see, all my opponent has argued that a fetus has life and that it will eventually be human, this is insufficient. It needs more concise evidence, PRO needs to prove that a fetus is conscious, that it is sentient and is aware of its surroundings, existence, thoughts, sensations. But still, this fetus = human argument isn't enough and doesn't entirely mean that we should illegalize abortion. Considering that I’ve shown that the vast majority of abortions occur in the embryonic period, this argument pretty much falls. Furthermore, PRO must prove that an embryo is still as equal as a fetus or a human being, he also needs to show sufficient proof that it is enough to ban them. I’m expanding my rebuttal on this in my contentions below. Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? My opponent seems to be confusing us with calculations and claims that the USFG could have saved 21 trillion USD if Roe wasn’t decided because 50 million un-aborted people could’ve lived by now and each would have earned an average of $42K. This is utterly ridiculous and misleading. Out of those 50 million, how can you say for sure that they didn’t migrate to other countries, or if they even have a decent job, or if they died or have an illness. How can you say for sure that if Roe was overturned by then, this won’t affect 50 million abortions? Women will still abort nevertheless, since they have the means and free will to do whatever they want, regardless of the rule of law. Overall, this argument is a shallow attempt made by PRO which is ambiguous. Next, abortion costs vary {4}, but it isn’t necessarily $350 since there are private orgs funding women and helping them on family planning. There are clinics that provide cheap abortions for women who are poor. There are also state-funded clinics that operate on these practices. So this just means that the state has some profits. Also, since an average of 1.21 million abortions happen each year {1a} and if we multiply that to the costs ($300 to $1000 approx.) {4}, the total would be over $1B profit. Seriously an economical advantage. But let’s look at the downside, if we illegalize abortion, back alley abortions will happen anyway. Would you want the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state? CASE These are my contentions for now, I reserve the right to drop or add more arguments & references later on. C1: Morality This premise actually irrelevant to the topic since this is too broad and controversial. Morality and religion has nothing to do with the legislature and that the government has no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. Furthermore, my opponent failed to show that killing innocent human beings (in this case, the fetuses) are wrong. It seems he forgot, but nevertheless, I will show you why this is not always the case. Utilitarianism A simple definition of Utilitarianism is that it determines the moral worth of an action only by its resulting outcome, and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences {5}. Now, a moral philosopher, Judith Thomson offered a thinking experiment {6} {7}: Imagine waking up one morning and find yourself attached to a famous violinist by means of a long tube, that violinist is unconscious. Doctors tell you that if you remove this tube, the Violinist will die. Doctors also tell you that you have to limit your time and you have to eat more. Also, because a parasite-like being is attached to you, you can’t go to work because you cannot concentrate and may suffer from public humility. What if you are poor and you need to work? Is it permissible to kill the violinist? What would most people do? This argument theory proves that even though fetuses/embryos have the right to life, it’s still morally permissible to abort them. Thomson argued that it is. She says that the right to life does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something—the use of your body—to which he has no right. This moral argument relates to women’s rights and why fetuses shouldn’t have rights. See below. C2: Fetus Argument Since the vast majority aborts during the embryonic period, I’m not sure why we need to debate the fetus’ biological form since it has no relevance to the illegalization of this practice, but I’ll proceed anyway. A fetus being human is highly a controversial issue and it will probably never end. Fetus not legally human. Though a fetus can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens, it is not a sentient human being that is a full-fledged member of society. It is neither conscious nor viable. Thus making it not have rights and must not receive the same rights as fully developed humans. If we declare abortion murder should we declare miscarriages manslaughter? Furthermore, as I said, my opponent needs to provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being. ‘Having a life and eventually being a human’ is NOT enough. Fetus not really innocent Addressing the theory presented, J.T stated that even if the embryo/fetus has a right to life, it does NOT have a right to use the pregnant woman's body, so technically, the fetus is not at all innocent as it invades the woman’s privacy and violates women’s rights. Ergo, abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. C3: Illegalization Downside I’m running out of characters, so I’ll make this brief and continue next round. Violates Rights The mother’s right to life is essential, and if we illegalize abortion, we are violating that right. There are many scenarios where the mother’s life is at risk unless she aborts, if we deprive them of aborting, we are not only killing the mother, but also giving society a bad name. It also violates dignity and respect. Women who are raped should not suffer 9 months of carrying a child she did not want, especially if she is poor. A woman should not suffer or be forced to carry a fetus for months. This is a breach to human dignity. The government has the obligation to protect its citizens from harm, if a doctor knows that the baby is ill in the womb, he should advice the mother for her to make a decision. Criminalization also deprives women on the right to choose and healthcare. Since I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion violates rights and that it poses a danger to women, this practice should remain legal. Esp. in the circumstances of rape, incest, health risks, medical need, etc. Crime Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {8}. The NY times also showed statistics that abortion whether legal or not will not change society {9}. CONCLUSION In other words, I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion is very much a disadvantage to economy and society and does more harm than good. I’ve negated my opponent’s premises and made my arguments. I await PRO’s response. Good luck! CITATIONS http://goo.gl...\", 'I apologize for the delay. Thanks for instigating, good luck and happy holidays!', 'C1:Fetus=HumanMy opponent dismisses my argument that the fetus/embryo is part of the H. Sapiens species without any valid justification. Also, my opponent has dropped one of my most important points which is that the fetus/embryo has all the human DNA that will ever be developed in its lifetime. Biologically speaking, the embryo is not a potential human life, it is a human life. Coupled with the facts that is it from the H. Sapiens species and has all human DNA, there is no valid justification for not considering the embryo to be a human being. My opponent tries to dismiss my \"coma argument\" by saying that a person in a coma already already has legal rights and is not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights. Legal Rights The argument is moot and invalid from Round 1. Current legality is not of a matter of concern in this debate. Therefore the fact that the person in the coma already had legal rights is dismissed. Not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights I quote from my opponent:\"embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because person hood is defined by the state)\"The second part of the argument can be dismissed. How the State currently defines person hood is irrelevant. My opponent states that there is a distinct differentiation between supposed rights of a human being outside the womb and inside the womb. First of all, he has not provided any valid justification for why the human being inside the womb should have less rights than the human being outside the womb. Second, if being inside/outside the womb makes so much difference, then what is the difference between a fetus ten minutes before birth and immediately after birth? Except for the surrounding environment, there are absolutely no differences between these two circumstances. This point of my opponent is therefore refuted. C1: Bear ScenarioIt seems as if my opponent has misunderstood the bear scenario. First of all, the point isn\\'t whether or not the person who shot the gun was doing it accidentally. The point is that it is not worth it to take the risk when there could be a real human being behind the bushes. The man did not think that he was shooting a bear. He knew that it could have been a bear or a human, a 50/50 chance. Whether or not society condemns him is irrelevant. C1: Spiegel\\'s Argument My opponent has virtually dropped this point and he untruthfully proclaims that he will rebut it in the morality segment. His only defense was \"dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? \". Death is natural, but that whole argument also hinges on pregnancy having special social value and being the precondition to society. Death does not have any special social value. In fact, if everybody was immortal, and therefore without death, society would be able to function. But without pregnancy, the precondition for society in our world, we would all die out. My point is that even though death is natural, it is not the indispensable means by which society is created nor does it have any special social value. C2: Economical Disadvantage My opponent has done literally nothing here nor in the previous round to rebut my points. I have shown them to be valid under average statistics. I have also left out the fact that many abortion are taxpayer funded which adds to the economic societal detriment. He states that \"Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. \" However, he has nothing to back up his assumption. Black market profits are still economically beneficial as the provider obtains money which he can spend on various societal goods. The people who illegally performed the abortions still spent the money back to society. C3: Hippocratic OathI will address each of my opponent\\'s concerns:1) This oath is not historically taken by physicians; it is still taken by physicians. This also an appeal to novelty. Just because something is old, does not make it any less valid.2) This oath focuses on morality, instead of binding legality. Not only does this debate have nothing to do with current legality, but just because something is not binding, does not make it any less valid.3) False. In the US, only physicians can perform abortions. (8)4) False. According to the National Library of Medicine, that is the original oath. (9)C4: MoralityJust because I did not put it in Round 2, does not mean that I concede that killing innocent human beings is acceptable. Not only is this common logic, but also backed up by my Round 3 rebuttal. My opponent has provided two examples of when he thinks that my case would fall apart due to technicalities. I will rebut both of them. It is highly unlikely that both birth control and physical contraceptives would fail when used together. Anyways, it is possible. My opponent has completely neglected the part where I previously said that by engaging in the act of coitus, the participants are automatically taking up a risk. Contraceptives might reduce the risk, but they don\\'t eliminate them. Whether sub-consciously or consciously, the risk has already been taken and the blame is put on the people engaging in the act of coitus. To put the blame on the baby is absurd and illogical. When a woman\\'s life is threatened, abortion is permissible, as stated by our rules. Also, even if the woman\\'s life is not threatened but she is somewhat temporarily disabled, the killing of the baby is not justified simply because of a temporary \"disability. Would it be justified to kill your child if he would not let you go to work? No. C5: Fetus =/= Legal HumanAgain, the term legal is irrelevant to this debate. You have definitely not proven that the coma argument is invalid. Readers can refer back to \"Fetus=Human\". C6: Fetus not really innocentRefuted as part of Utilitarianism last round and Morality this round. C7: Violates RightsMy opponent mentions \"moral, universal or God-given rights\". He has introduced these so called \"rights\" without any proof of them even existing. My opponent\\'s introduction and statement of these so called \"rights\" absurd and rendered moot. Right to choose and to have dignity- Nobody is forcing women to have children. If they really don\\'t want to then they can abstain from having coitus. Just because birth control fails, it does not automatically give the women the right to abort. As previously discussed, a certain level of risk is accepted simply by engaging in coitus. Just because someone cannot economically handle a child, does not give them the right to kill it. Many different approaches can be taken such as adoption. Also, having lived is better than never having lived. C8: CrimeMy opponent\\'s evidence is not based in the US and therefore is nullified and moot. There is no proof that these patterns would have been replicated in the US. I provided a source which stated otherwise, but apparently my opponent automatically thinks that a book source is invalid with no justification whatsoever. Also, President of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Mary Calderone pointed out in a 1960 American Journal of Health article that Dr. Kinsey showed in 1958 that 84% to 87% of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing. Dr. Calderone herself concluded that \"90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by physicians. \" It seems that the vast majority of the alleged “back-alley butchers” eventually became the “reproductive health providers” of our present day. (7)Conclusion Embryo is a human. Immoral to kill humans. Abortion is an economical detriment. Women do not have a right to abortion. By having coitus, they are exposing themselves to the risk. I hope that my opponent does not introduce any new information or sources in the next round. Sources:. http://goo.gl...Great debate.', 'Before I proceed, I would like to point out that I made a mistake. Most abortions are in fact performed in the embryonic Period and I will slightly change my argument according to this. This should cause no problem to my opponent as all of his arguments will apply this also. Fetus=HumanA human is defined as (1):A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. SapiensBelonging to a species is determined from the DNA of an organism. From the moment of conception, the new organism is a member of the H. Sapiens species. The organism has all of the human DNA that will ever be used or developed in its lifetime that is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. My opponent has failed to address perhaps the strongest point of my case, the fact that an embryo has all human DNA that will ever be obtained in its life. If a human is a member of the H. Sapiens, then a embryo is a human. My opponent has stated that sentience and awareness are necessary for human life. This is obviously not true. By my opponent\\'s theory, a person who is in a coma is not a person, even though he is. Coma patients cannot feel anything outside of them and are unconscious, yet they are still human. This proposition that human life depends on sentience is absurd. Also, pregnancy is an essential tool in the building of society. It is responsible for the development and growth of mankind. Not only this, but it is also a natural cycle by the human body. To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust. Consider an alteration of this argument made by Jim Spiegel:(2)1. Pregnancy is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.4. Abortions which seek to terminate and reject a pregnancy constitute a rejection of the special value of pregnancy.5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.6. Therefore, abortion is unjust. My opponent has also asked me to prove that if a embryo were a human, abortion should be banned. This premise is self-explanatory. It is immoral to kill innocent human beings that have done nothing wrong and are coming into existence because of a natural cycle called pregnancy. Economical DisadvantageI used average statistics to determine the calculations. Some people people might have had a worse job, some better. Some might have lived longer, others shorter. These are averages. Some people might have migrated to other countries, but there are no concrete statistics. Even if an unlikely 10% migrated, it would still be an economical detriment. Also, about 14% of all abortions in the United States are paid for with public funds, virtually all of which are state funds. 17 states pay for abortions for some women. (6) This adds on to the detriment. Also, the average abortions costs about $350. (6)My Opponent\\'s CaseC1:MoralityMy opponent is stating the government should have no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. However, the concept of human rights in it self, requires a certain set of morals to recognize them such as not murder, stealing, etc. .. Again, my opponent is stating that it is not necessarily immoral to kill millions of innocent human beings. He has the massive BOP to back this up. C1:UtilitarianismMy opponent has brought a seemingly irrelevant argument into this discussion.1. The person who randomly woke up with a violinist connected has not been previously aware of any sort of risk that this might happen. It simply happened. But this situation does not happen in a pregnancy. Unless CON can show me a woman who doesn\\'t know that sex might lead to pregnancy, the woman has taken the risk upon herself just by having sex. Whether it be subconsciously or consciously, by knowing the possible circumstances in which the sex might result in, she has subjected herself to the risk. When somebody chooses to be subjected to a risk and the risk happens, the blame should only be on themselves, not the innocent human being inside of them. The only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in Round 1. 2. The circumstances of the attached violinist and pregnancy are highly different. Pregnant women can still work, earn a salary, go to school, and our society does not condone embarrassment of pregnant women. C2: Fetus not legally humanI already partly addressed this argument in the \"fetus=human\" rebuttal. What I have to mention is that in Round 1, it was explicitly stated that \"This debate is about the future legality of abortion, therefore all present legal arguments for abortion are currently not valid. \". My opponent has accepted the definition as this point is not only violating the rules, but also an invalid point as was mentioned in Round 1. This point should automatically be thrown out, but I will provide a brief rebuttal. My opponent has stated that because an embryo is not conscious, it should not be granted rights. This is false. People in a comatose are given rights are not conscious nor viable. My opponent stated that I need to \" provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being\". This has already been done. An embryo or a fetus has all the possible DNA that a human can ever obtain in its lifetime. DNA makes an organism part of a specific species. The embryo cannot be described as \"can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens,\" (by my opponent). The embryo is a member of the H. Sapiens. C2: Fetus not really innocent1. By having sex, the women is taking the risk of pregnancy. If the woman allows the sex to happen on her own will, then she is allowing the embryo to be inside her. My opponent also has not stated why the embryo or fetus does not have a right to use the pregnant women\\'s body. If it does not have a right to do this, then all pregnancies should be aborted as it is a violation of the rights of the female.2. My opponent has stated that abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. I agree. This was addressed in Round 1 rules. In circumstances in which the female is at the risk of dying or has been raped, abortion is permissible. C3: Violates RightAgain, this has all been addressed in the rules of Round 1. Abortion is permissible in cases of when the women has been raped, incest, or when her life has been threatened. This point is again a violation of the rules and should be disregarded. C3: CrimeMy opponent and I have previously agreed that this debate applies solely to the United States. My opponent\\'s sources are flawed. If you take a look at his #8 source, it applies to worldwide trends in the legalization/de legalization of abortion. It doesn\\'t mention the US and instead talks about Eastern Europe, Uganda, and South Africa. This source and information is invalid. In fact, \"a reasonable estimate for the actual number of criminal abortions per year in the pre legalization era [prior to 1967] would be from a low of 39,000 (1950) to a high of 210,000 (1961) and a mean of 98,000 per year. \"(3)Compared to the 1.5 million+ abortions per year after Roe v. Wade,(4) we can conclude that the legalization/de legalization of abortion causes massive differences. Case:My opponent has given me a chance to post another small contention:The Hippocratic OathAs all abortions today are performed by doctors, all doctors must take the Hippocratic Oath. (5)It states that:\"I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion\". An abortion is clearly a violation of the Hippocratic Oath and cannot be deemed to continue. Sources:. http://goo.gl...', 'Now onto mine. The fetus is a humanMy first contention is that a fetus is human. I will choose to focus on a fetus, not a zygote or an embryo because most abortions happen during the fetal period. A fetus is simply the combination of the male sperm, and the women’s ovum. Combining the two creates an entirely unique organism, not alike to its mother or father. There is no doubt that the fetus is biologically alive. It fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life: (1) metabolism, (2) growth, (3) reaction to stimuli, and (4) reproduction. (1) A fetus will, in no doubt, become a human being. There is absolutely no question about it. A fetus will turn into a living, breathing, and thinking organism like you and I. So why deny it the same rights that are given to us? Lets take this for an example: You are a hunter out in the woods. You see something rustle in the bushes. You aren’t sure whether it’s a bear, or a human. Is it worth it to take that shot, knowing that there could be a human there? That directly relates to abortion. Even if you aren’t sure whether the fetus is a human, is it worth it to take that risk? Benefit of the doubt should always be given to life, not death. One very important point is that the entire biological and scientific communities agree on one common definition for human life: one human individual’s life begins at the completion of the union of his father’s sperm and his mother’s ovum, a process called \"conception,\" \"fertilization\" or \"fecundation. \" This is according to the one of the only embryology textbooks used in medical schools: Langman’s Medical Embryology written by Thomas W. Sadler PhD(2) Continuing on with the point that a fetus is a human, we have to realize that not only is the fetus being created by the human’s natural processes, it is a unique human individual, just as each of us is. Resulting from the union of the female gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes) and the male gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes), the conceptus is a new—although tiny—individual. A fetus has all of the basic components needed for human life, so to kill it with an abortion would be equivalent of killing a human. It has its own unique genetic code (with forty-six chromosomes), which is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. From this point until death, no new genetic information is needed to make the unborn entity a unique human individual. In fact according to biology, human development begins with conception. From the moment of conception, the being is complete. Nothing else — no bits or pieces — will be naturally added from this time until the old man or woman dies — nothing but nutrition and oxygen. This being is programmed from within, moving forward in a self-controlled, ongoing process of growth, development, and replacement of his or her own dying cells. To argue the fact that this is not human goes against any scientific and medical standards, which is what our current society is based upon. (3) According to Keith Moore in Essentials of Human Embryology: \"Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). \"Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being. \" To summarize the first contention: I have concluded that a fetus is a living being, is a unique human individual, and is simply a stage of development in the human process. Abortion is economically harmful Abortion is, in fact, economically detrimental to society as a whole. Lets look at some stats. Since the legalization of Roe V Wade in the United States, there have been about 50 million abortion. (4) Abortions cost about $350 dollars to the average citizen. (5) Therefore, over the years that abortion has been legal in the US, the private sector has received 1 750 000 000 000. In other words, one trillion seven-hundred fifty billion dollars. That seems like a large amount, but the amount that the state lost is more. The average US salary is 42 000 per year. (6) The average life expectancy in the US is 78.1 years (7). Abortion was legal from 1973 to current, or 38 years. Since we can assume that every person who wasn\\'t aborted would live to this day, the calculations are relatively simple. Multiply the number of abortion (50 000 000) by (42 000) the average salary per year and then multiply it by 78, the average life expectancy. We receive the number 2 100 000 000 000. That is the amount of money that the State could have gained by not performing abortions. That is considerably larger than the money gained from abortions. Therefore, abortion is a societal economic detriment.

In other words, in order for the T-800 to even exist, Skynet must dominate the earth, have already polluted the seas to the point of wiping out all life within them, and have turned the entire earth into the earth we see in Terminator 4, mainly ruined cities and deserts punctuated by small swamps and forests. Spongebob, just like Squidley and Patrick and that squirrel thing, would already be dead from the pollutants poured into a certain coconut before the T-800 even began production.\", 'I am sorry for not being around last round as I had urgent business. However I would like to elaborate and say that it is only one Terminator coming to Bikini Bottom through time rather than the entire Skynet army. It is not revealed the Terminators motivations except he wants Spongebob dead. as this is no holds barred we will herefore give this little sponge alll of Skynets abilities. Living in a house with small children I have wacthed a varity of episodes including the movie and deduced that spongebob is invulrable. Here are a list of examples. (I am sorry but I can not source these I can not source these.) Indestructability: (1): In an episode where Spongebob eats a bomb in a pie (don\\'t ask.) after a specific point in time the bomb detonates with an obvious explosion, blowing up a neigboring wall and injuring a bystander to a burning crisp, and spongebob doesn\\'t notice. Even the terminator would be killed by an internal explosion. Although this and almost all of the examples are comic relief, he can assumingly use these powers at will. Unlike Roger rabbit rules. (He can only use them when it would be funny.) (2): In an episode where Squidward is describing a murder (Nickelodeon material, right)Spongebob imitates it by chopping off his own arm and grasping it regrowing his arm and cutting off the opposite hand in a wash rinse repeat fashion. I can liken him to a silver terminator right now. (3): Although he is not physically destroyed, in a bullying episode an extremely schwarzenneger-esque fish repeateadly punches him with not a single wince of pain or a drop of sweat. This proceeds for a period of over 24 hours and the fish eventually passes out. As spongebob says, \"I must be made out of some spongy material.\" Stamina: (1): In a complex plot where spongebob gains superpowers. He has the ability to run cartoonishly fast to the point of creating a tornado and burning himself into nothingness. He still sruvives of course and is fully able to gain these superpowers again but never does. (2): In an extremely creepy episode when he is locked in a cave and trying to eat a freind as cannibalism he uses a few lures and traps but manages to last a long time without food. Although the terminator does not need food this could help in the case of Bikini bottom turning into something similar to the deserts and wastelands in Terminator 4. Mentality: (1): When spongebob is fighting a co-worker over a promotion, he goes into a military attitude similar to that of patton and lays elaborate predator style traps to prevent him from going to his workplace. These are so ingenious and cartoonish they would no doubt alone defeat a terminator easier than a pool of molten metal. As an added note for stamina he runs extremely fast to beat the opponent he runs to the workplace for a long point of time although not a supernatural amount. (2): As he is constantly practicing karate with a freind he has (I am serious) trained himself to be aware for any sneak attack and even has Karate gloves handy. Strength: (1): Spongebob has over the past been trained in Karate, Wrestling, Olympics and even has a spatula which can shoot patties as projectiles with shotgun force. I am not making this up. (2): As a phenominally bad driver, it is a running theme to have him destroy the town, buildings and all unintentionnaly. He would be great in a drive by. Over all spongebob wwith no holds barred would be a perfect opponent for anyone out there and might even compare to a silver terminator.', \"I believe that it is a little known fact Spongebob Squarepants is a BAMF. Anyone with a reply may answer and for the time being I will not give away spongebob's powers. All I am saying is no holds in the fight will be barred and by Terminator I mean the standard T-800 Schwarzenegger model. I look forward to this most epic of battles.\", 'Apologies for forfeiting the previous round. Certainly Christianity is the largest single organization for healthcare in the world, but with over a billion members there aren\"t many organizations that could offer that level of service, but that\"s not to say they wouldn\"t if possible. This has nothing to do with Christianity, this is a want to help your fellow man, an instinctive drive that all people and societies need in order for us to survive and evolve. To dispute your point on the church starting the orphanage movement I will direct you to this piece from the writings of Plato, many hundreds of years before the church was helping orphans, by the way, no doubt they were orphans due to some war funded by the church. Plato (Laws, 927) says: \"Orphans should be placed under the care of public guardians. Men should have a fear of the loneliness of orphans and of the souls of their departed parents. A man should love the unfortunate orphan of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child. He should be as careful and as diligent in the management of the orphan\\'s property as of his own or even more careful still.\"(1) Furthermore, you mention Jane Addams, but a recent study of her found that Jane Addams \"had come to epitomize the force of secular humanism.\" Her image was, however, \"reinvented\" by the Christian churches.(2) Here we can see that you have fallen into a trap laid by the church, claiming that one of the brightest lights of humanity belonged to their ranks, when in reality Jane Addams was agnostic at best and indeed a secular humanist. Now to quote you directly: \"He (god) wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves.\" Now this argument is heavily flawed to me, why should this apparent god receive praise for all the good humanity achieves, yet when something bad happens it\"s the humans who are at fault, now to me that seems to be a slight double standard. Now I will leave you with this. In mathematics a positive multiplied by a positive equals a positive, but, a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative. So if we take all the negatives Christianity has done and all the positives and multiply them together, it is still a negative. To put this in more simple terms imagine a serial killer with 50 innocent victims. Should he be forgiven because he did some charity work on the weekends? The answer is of course no. Christianity is not a force for good in the world. The hatred found in Leviticus and the pedophilia dispersed in the places of worship are enough to see this on their own. Not to mention the other points I have raised. People are good and just enough already to need a bronze-age book dictating their lives. (1)http://www.perseus.tufts.edu... (2)Christie, C., Gauvreau, M. (2001). A Full-Orbed Christianity: The Protestant Churches and Social Welfare in Canada, 1900-1940 McGill-Queen\\'s Press - MQUP, Jan 19, 2001 pg 107', 'When I observe the horrors in the back catalog of Christianity, it seems fitting that the image chosen as their earthly symbol, is one of most abhorrent forms of bronze-age Middle Eastern execution. In order to fully understand the role Christianity plays in the world today we must first look back at the terrors conducted in its repugnant name. Here I will name but a few of the achievements of Christianity: The crusades, the inquisition, the persecution of the Jewish people, the forced conversion of indigenous peoples, the African slave trade and the deafening silence during Hitler\\'s Final Solution. A list of accomplishments, which perhaps, would not be towards the top of ones curriculum vitae. Now to look towards the modern day, the Christian church remains a patriarchal establishment. The injustice to women is institutional. That is half the world\"s population who are doomed to be listed with the livestock. On top of the patriarchy there is of course anti-homosexuality, these are people who are being punished by the church, not for what they believe, but for who they love and how they express it. This cannot be good for the world. Love is so desperately lacking in life, love needs dispensing not suppressing. Another unforgivable aspect of the modern day church is the idea that AIDS as a disease is bad, however, not as bad as condoms. Millions dead, for whom? And for what? It certainly wasn\\'t for any force of good. Finally in this opening statement I will briefly touch on the most reprehensible part of Christianity in recent times, the long-standing institutional child rape. I do not think I need to expand on the point of pedophilia and why it is wrong. A force for good? Well, unquestionably not a good that I would fight for. No one can argue Christianity doesn\\'t have some wonderful morals, however, these morals are not exclusive to Christianity, and the works of charity done by Christians are not exclusive to Christians. The force for good is already within human beings, Christianity, perhaps not intentionally, but undoubtedly persistently, distorts it.', 'I will be arguing against the premise. The debate will go as follows. 1) Acceptance 2) Opening statement 3) Rebuttal 4) Closing statement', \"Ultimately the question being asked is if Christianity is a force of good in the world. IS it a force for good, not HAS it been a force for good. And ultimately even when you look at it from two different angles, it's apparent that indeed our God is a God of love. He wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves. Thank you.\", \"While you are correct about the crusades and other battles fought over Christianity, remember that while the humans may not always make the right choices, the religion governing them wants them to. The bible itself is indeed a strong force for good, and there are countless major benefits from Christianity. The church is the single largest provider of healthcare and education in the world, especially in the poorest countries where it is needed most. Christianity also pioneered social work. The first American woman to ever be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize was Jane Addams. The church also co-founded the first settlement house in the US, hoping to bridge the gap between poor and rich. The London society for the prevention of cruelty to children, or the London SCCP, campaigning from the wider church, was the first force to stop cruelty towards children, and from them the first UK law about child neglect and cruelty was created. Churches were also the first orphanages, opening their arms in the Middle Ages to unwanted children that were left at the Churches' doorsteps. This practice ultimately started the orphanage movements we have today. I could go on for hours listing the countless things Christianity has done for the world.\", 'Hello, thanks for putting out the challenge. Shall we hear the opening argument against the matter?', \"My opponent hasn't responded to any arguments. I extend all arguments. xxhellogoodbyexx I had a great time debating with you. Thank you for making this debate possible.\", \"The excuse does not revolve on capacity to consume. It deals with the human values we believe are fundamental to mankind. We are more important. Selfish as it seems, a human's collective thinking would contradict. Would you seriously consider killing a man before killing a chicken? This is why it is legal to kill an animal for eating. It is not, however, legal for someone to kill a human, especially for cannibalism (crime against humanity). It is undebatable that human nature leads us to believe that we are more important than any other animal. Why so? That is irrelevant to the resolution. It is only used for comparison. On the other hand, with my opponent's logic a person should die in place for a chicken. That said, I would like to add that I believe cruel treatment of animals is wrong. However, my opponents alternative is clearly contradictory to most beliefs. If a couple of chickens have to die in order to create a cure for cancer, so be it. I extend all my arguments made in the previous round. I have voided all rebuttals and await any further argument in round 3.\", 'Hello. The reason my opponent votes negative on Animal Testing is because animals do not deserve the cruelties put upon them. However, my opponents alternative is flawed for the following reasons. 1. It is essential in scientific and technological advances. As long as pain and suffering for the animals is minimized, I believe that it is acceptable to use testing on animals as opposed to having humans go through the same process. That said, it is very impractical to have humans endure these tests. 2. It would prevent any harmful side-effects had the testing been done on humans. The ethics is questionable. However, it is widely believed that the value of a human is MUCH greater than the value on an animal. It is undebatable that we, as people, would rather have someone else do something. As long as everyone accepts this fact, there are no ethical dilemmas. In summary, I believe that animal testing is VERY desirable and the ethical issues are outweighed by the benefits of using them as opposed to human beings. My opponents argument is loose and the alternative is impractical and may cause danger to human beings.', 'no further arguments..... thank you opponent for your participation. I still believe there should be a better alternative to animal testing and hope we solve soon into the future.... thank you! Thank you, best regards!', \"Why is it so impractical for humans to endure this? what makes them so different than animals? why are animals more greater and more important than animals, they are larger and consume more? that i believe is no excuse. we basically already test the products ourselves. Would you look at a bottle of body lotion, body soap, makeup and say iam going to put it in my mouth..... probally not... so why would you force down someone else's throat. If you think its alright and just natural to do so..... we should shove you in cages and shove tubes down your throat, force foreign objects down your throat and beat you senslessly. And you still have the heart to say thats okay?\", 'Why should animals have to suffer for our society to make medicines and makeup for humans. just because they dont have a voice to speak, makes them an easy target to take advantage of for their own uses. Its very selfish and unnesscary. Why dont we make people get tested on these prodcuts, what makes animals the target for being abused in such unbelievable ways. What makes animals different then humans? every year 100 millon animals are killed just so your hair stays in place?', \"Sometimes I like to dress up in women's clothing and eat turkey.\", '1) I don\\'t think that a prom that you explain will not be taken seriously later in your argument will help the cause of improving DDO members\\' views on females. Moreover, the concepts of \"Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping?,\" \"getting laid,\" and \"dropping a baby eight months later\" don\\'t seem like very gender-equal principles. The opponent states, \"Prom on DDO isnt supposed to be as serious as the one on real life, its supposed to be a fun hook up game.\" This doesn\\'t really correspond with the actual concept of a prom. This is more like the parody of a prom, which is not addressed in the resolution or in the initial argument. Guys will hook up with guys, and then the anti-gay marriage people will be offended and violence will ensue. Let us remember that 33% of DDO is anti-gay marriage [1], so this would not be the most gay-friendly event. 2) Regardless of how they act, many DDO members are beyond high school (and prom) age. Take RoyLatham for example [2]; he is married and probably has no interest in finding a date for an online prom. This prom idea excludes many important members of the DDO community who are married or whose partners are not interested in joining them in a virtual prom. And I\\'m posing the idea that this would make younger DDO users more vulnerable to predatory attacks by pedophiles who lurk all over the internet, including DDO. 3) I don\\'t know if this prom thing would even catch on, so I wouldn\\'t emphasize the gossip argument too much. And if the event fails, then the gossip will simply be negative (i.e., how moronic imabench is for coming up with this concept.) 4) ...What? So basically it consists of baseless voting from anyone on DDO who chooses to vote? This has nothing to do with the traditional concept of Prom King and Prom Queen, which actually typically involves votes from people who actually know them. 5) Well, that really has little to do with the actual concept of \"prom,\" but all right, then. 6) \"Hook up\" with anonymous people on an online debate site? What would that even entail? Where would the gossip arise from, by the way? From what I see, this whole idea would be forum-based... ... So, uh, in conclusion... Um, in conclusion... Why the **** am I debating this? ... [1] http://www.debate.org... [2] http://www.debate.org...', '1) There is no indication that girls are not treated well by guys right now. And it is not plausible that a virtual prom would lead to a strong increase in conduct; in fact, I think trolling would spike. The anonymity offered by the internet allows for people to not take this \"prom\" thing as seriously as they would in real life. On the point that \"the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls,\" it will be likely that many guys will be left without prom dates and therefore be vengeful, leading to a number of prom-crashing attempts; hence, the opponent\\'s theory that there would be an upswing in conduct is nullified. 2) Many of the males on here have already completed high school, but for those that have not, it would be risky for them to attempt to contact \"prom dates\" on this site, which consists of many anonymous members whose true backgrounds are unknown to us. Having adolescent males staying in contact with people who state that they are males on this website is not a good idea. 3) The opponent hasn\\'t proven whether or not the gossip would benefit DDO or not. Moreover, the whole \"acid in the punch\" and \"getting laid\" stuff seems to be a little.... Uh, how would this prom even work? 4) What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen? It would most likely just be based on debates, because that\\'s how most of the people on here know each other... So what is the use of incorporating the \"prom\" concept in their names? 5) This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it. It is not germane to the resolution (whether or not DDO should have a prom.) --- 6) Feasibility: How would this happen? I kindly ask the opponent to define \"prom\" in a context that would suit what he is trying to argue.', \"DDO shouldn't have a prom. Let's see your arguments.\", '1) \"the concepts of \"Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping? ,\" \"getting laid,\" and \"dropping a baby eight months later\" don\\'t seem like very gender-equal principles. \"I can see why girls completely degrading a man for dropping a baby eight months later might not be gener equality, but that happens to women to so your argument is invalid\"This doesn\\'t really correspond with the actual concept of a prom.

Prom on DDO isnt going to involve actually meeting people in real life, it is only going to be on the forums, it will just be a community activity for people to gossip and chat about, and will be harmless. People ask people to Prom and thats about as serious as it will ever get, from there you simply announce who your prom date is and participate in all the prom games and gossip that comes with the event. Older people can stay out of it, People dont have to go, its all for fun.', '1) Respect towards women\"There is no indication that girls are not treated well by guys right now\"RoyalPaladin and Rogue both briefly left the website because of how sh*tty guys (one in particular who shall for the sake of this debate remain anonymous) treated them. Also look at the treatment that Gabbie222 got from guys on this site who trolled the hell out of her when she spammed a couple debates. Girls are treated poorly in some cases and a DDO prom might help them be respected more on DDO. \"The anonymity offered by the internet allows for people to not take this \"prom\" thing as seriously as they would in real life\"Prom on DDO isnt supposed to be as serious as the one on real life, its supposed to be a fun hook up game that everyone does for maybe a few days or so, then they announce who their prom \"date\" is, a couple of other Prom things are done and then thats the end of it. A DDO Prom would basically be a little populatiry stunt done once a year like Gender Change Week, Avatar Week, or something like that. DDO Prom is designed to be more like a 1 week fad then a serious thing. \"it will be likely that many guys will be left without prom dates and therefore be vengeful, leading to a number of prom-crashing attempts\"1) And wouldnt that be funny as sh*t?2) Guys can hook up with guys if they want......3) You wont get chastized very bad for not having a Prom Date on DDO......2) Guys need this\"Many of the males on here have already completed high school\"And many of them act like they are still in Middle School, and I proudly can say I am one of those people depending on what I am debating (See Poop has DNA Debate)\"Having adolescent males staying in contact with people who state that they are males on this website is not a good idea.\"Well im against online gay pornography rings too but the DDO Prom wouldnt be in real life it would just be on the forums where everyone posts who their date is and what they do during the prom and stuff like that.....3) The Gossip\"The opponent hasn\\'t proven whether or not the gossip would benefit DDO or not\"DDO sure lights up everytime somebody gossips about something. Look at any trial or any case where one person accuses another of cheating, votebombing, voting unfairly, yatta yatta yatta and people eat it up. This gossip though would be harmless since its just a bunch of people having fake hookups....4) Prom King + Queen\"What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen?\"It could be the cutest couple, the surprise couple, the weirdest couple, its a popularity contest and the winners are just chosen by voters who vote for any couple for any reason. 5) Prom Mafia\"This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it. It is not germane to the resolution\"DDO Prom would be 1/2 anouncing who is with who on one forum and then 1/2 fun prom action stuff in the game forum with other things sprinkled in. 6) How would it even work?Prom will be held on 1 week every year, and it would be the same week each time. In the time leading up to it people would \"hook up\" with others online and then when the time comes simply announce who their prom date would be. Then as the week progresses Prom activities and games are done as people discuss who hooked up with who, who got stood up, and gossip while a host of Prom games are held in the game forum which will be based loosely off of other mafia style games. At the end of the week a contest will be held to determine the Prom King and Queen, along with a few other awards for other things, and then after that Prom ends, the site goes back to normal, gossip dies down, and in the end everyone becomes a little more friendly with each other in this website that over time has already grown into its own warped definition of a community. The next year at the same time the same thing happens again and a few tweaks are made to fix problems seen last year, etc etcThat is how Prom would work on DDO :)', 'Very Well then, reasons that DDO should have a Prom 1) It will make everyone more sociable and appreciative towards the females on DDO. It is a well known fact that the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls on here (at a rate of 2:1). If DDO had a prom then guys on DDO would in theory become more sociable and act more gentlemen-like towards women on DDO. Such a spike in conduct here on DDO among its members would also be welcomed to offset the usual amount of d*ckish behavior one normally sees between members in the forums and debates. 2) Guys need this Lets face it, people who spend a disproportionate amount of time on DDO most likely do not have as much luck with the ladies as they would like. A prom on DDO though allows those men to exercise their age old pickup lines, learn how to talk to women, and learn how to get the courage to ask a girl to prom, something that could benefit them later in life when their actual high school Prom comes around. 3) The gossip This is the biggest part about why there should be a prom in my opinion.... All the gossip that would be started once it was realized who showed up with the prom to who, it would be awesome! Does inferno get a date? Who is lucky enough to show up with Danielle as a date? Who does Royalpaladin choose to go with? If Jimtimmy gets a prom date then HOW THE HELL did he pull that off? Who was lucky enough to show up with Rogue or Mirza? Who will Thaddeus and FREEDO ask to Prom? Who will Innomen go to Prom with? Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping? Does somebody have a prom-night-dumpster-baby? Who tries to put acid in the punch? Who wakes up the next morning with a guy she doesnt know? Who gets laid that very night? Who drops a baby 8 months later? The gossip it would cause would diffuse all of the usual feuds we see going on in the forums, allow everyone to cool off, and have a bit of fun just gossiping over stuff. 4) Prom King and Queen This would be the biggest election on DDO next to the presidential election of DDO, Prom King and Queen would hold their title for an entire year (longer than the president would hold his) So if prom were to be held on DDO then a great honor would be given to the winning couple, and a tradition could form out of it, giving DDO some swagger and class. 5) Prom Mafia Yes you heard me right, Prom mafia. A game where everyone makes strategic moves against one another at Prom for personal reasons. During such a game one may \"accidentally\" spill their drink on someone they dont like, change the song midway through the dance, hit on somebody else\\'s prom date in an effort to try to catch them all (Pokemon!), or even to start dropping it like its hot and showing off some wicked dance moves. Such a thing would make Prom way more fun both for those who socialize on here and for those really into the gaming culture here on DDO.

Here are some highlights: America 77-0 over South Korea and 33-7 over Germany. http://wc2007.info... It's no wonder my opponent has not heard about it. It sucks. The games are blowouts, not exiting, and quite frankly no one cares. There just isn't enough demand for American football when soccer is so popular over the world; it's embedded and people's culture and serves are a symbol of a nation's pride. It's for the same reasons soccer has failed in America that football fails over seas. There is no reason for it when other nations have soccer and we have football.

For the sake of debate, we should be debating if this would cup \\'should\\' exist, or the con would say that its useless. My oppenents, and everyone\\'s for that matter, is that no other countries beside the US would be interested in playing, however (http://www.ifaf.info...), \"American football is a fascinating sport and its popularity has grown in more than 50 countries on six continents. American football began in the United States, but the sport has generated fans in other countries as diverse as Australia, South Korea and Finland.\" Football ball is being played all over the world, by all kinds of people, in all kinds of countries. A championship to highlight each countries skills wouldn\\'t be bad, it would be great because the game would gain exposure. The whole problem we have in America is that we assume that noone else plays this game so we fear even trying to expose it. IF we just expose the game more and more people will play it. My opponents other argument revolved around saying that, even though we have a world cup it is not \\'exiciting\\' enough. Well, ok, first of all you didn\\'t look at all the score: The Championship game saw the US winning in double overtime against Japan 23-20 (http://wc2007.info...), and all of the games except the prelims involving Japan and the US (Where they both won there two prelims games handily) the other games remained very competive, especially the 3rd/4th place game and the 5th/6th place game which was 7-0 and 3-0 respectivly. Anyway, Americans don\\'t care if the game is close, hell they encourage a blow out, as long as its for the Red, White, and Blue. Look at the Olympics, the \\'Reedem Team\\' (Named so because the US actually lost a basketball game in the Olympics and World Championships and didn\\'t walk away with a gold) walk away from Bejing with an 8-0 record, a gold medal, and a 21.5+ Scoring Margin. No game was close, even against Spain and Argentina (Ranked the highest in the world) the US still won by 11 and 20 points respectivly. After not being tested in the Olympics, the Redeem Team returned home as hereos for restoring honor to the US by winning their sport. A football World Cup would be no different, at least not for a long time. If IFAF would just simply market they\\'re product then people all across the US would openly watch and watch enthusiastically. No in the heat of June/July is going to turn away from Team USA playing a football game no matter how lopsided it is because 1) Its they\\'re country 2) They haven\\'t seen anthing but a few spring football games in six months. Once we convince Americans, I don\\'t think we\\'ll have to do to much to convince the rest of the world http://en.wikipedia.org...) For the \"2007 [World Cup] the total number of teams in the competition exceeded 20 countries\" including qualifications. If you already have 20 countries activly participating, and 50 countries showing interest in the sport, the competion is only sure to grow. They\\'re is plenty of competition out their for the US, we just have to be willing to accept it. Quiet Simply, all America has to do is embrace the World Cup that already exists and then the Sport will propel into a new era of international football. With the biggest proponent of Football behind it, the World Cup would be able to expand and grow just like soccer has untill it truely an honorable international championship.', \"The world is changing. With faster communication, satellite television, and air travel. Any one anywhere can communicate with people all over the world about sports, watch sporting events from all over the world, and even fly to any sporting event anywhere in the world. The ultimate winner from this has been the World Cup of Soccer (To simplify this debate I will use Soccer for the international game of Futball and Football for the American game of football.) What happens there? Countries send teams from all over the world, that spend the two leading up years trying to qualify, to the world's biggest stage, with the game's biggest stars, competing in a tournament with team as well as national pride on the line. FIFA (The international soccer organization) rakes in the money on their ideal invention, Qualify countries rake in money and international exposure and pride for winning. The world stands still and the entire sports world turns to one event that is seen all over the world. In America, we have long dis-enfranchised soccer, we set out to make a new and better sport: We call it football. And to America's credit, we have certainly embraced the sport. Developing it to a level of local pride and power that no use leagues or even our own US national teams can compete with: The NFL. The world stands still for soccer, America football. The problem with the American dream to create a sport to compete with soccer is that they actually have to compete with it not hide in their own corner and pout. Football, like soccer, has to become an international sport, contended on a world level, that does not limit its to the confines of the US. The will to play the sport is constently expanding, the sport itself is perhaps even expanding faster then American perception. The fear is that if we let other people play our sport, they might get better at it then us. Though the US may not be able to keep its dominance in the sport forever, like in Basketball, a little competition isn't that bad is it? What I'm proposing is a World Cup, or International competition of Football, where teams from around the world send national teams to advance the game to its highest level. The Format of the Cup would depend on the number of teams participating, obviously if to many want to participate then the issue would arise for regional qualifying and such, but the simple truth remains the need exists. The goal and orginal purpose of Football was to contend with soccer, and the only way to do that is to take the competition inter-national. The main American resent is that no one else plays, so why bother? If you build it, they will come. http://pointme.to... Illustrates numerous international Football sites and leagues (though some outdated) which Play Football. The obvious initial entries would be the United States, Canada, Mexico, Great Britian, Germany, Japan, and China. Several other European countries show interest, and small countries would probally jump in at least at first just to fill numbers and get international exposure. Yes, it is true the competition could get lopsided if NFL plays all go in on the side of the US, but playing gap would thin out and competition would increase. Even international Soccer competition outside of the upper crust is extremely titled to the bigger teams who's talent alone allow them to crush their opponents. Though constents blow outs wouldn't be fun, some games would be close. If not necessarily the US's games, the other competition would be on the same field. International Basketball has grown even with the US as a dominating leader in the sport really unbeaten when they try, however through time and exposure of the game, the sport has been able to grow in ways previously unimaginable. http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com... The sportsbusiness Journal reports the NFL in 9 Billion dollars in debt, that was over a year ago so no it probally a lot more. The NFL despite its huge popularity and selling out its games is running a defecit due to the few amount of games played and the large stadiums they build and then allow to sit empty most of the year. Cities could bid on having the world cup of football and thus bring in money, and if the NFL was smart they could create the world cup and thus add to their revenues with very little actual cost out put because the Stadiums are already built so just play in one of them. The World Cup could even be played in the Spring/Summer to give football fans, going through off-season withdrawl, the abiality to see new live football action with some of their favorite stars. The enjoyment of the Nation watching the redeem team this year capture the gold in Beijing could be seen on a football field. The Cup could be stage ever 2 or four years, but probally 2 since they won't add it as an Olympic sport. Having international games in the off-season would allow fans to get tastes football all year round, and also promote international fans with a taste of the NFL drawing in more viewers and potential markets for the NFL to dive into. A Football World Cup would be very profitable to anyone who hosted, I mean if Colleges can bring in 60,000 for their spring games (which are inter-squad), I think a little real competition would go over with the public quiet well. The Purpuse of football was to compete with the world, and untill they do that its purpose will not be achieved.\", 'Challenge Accepted!', 'I have no response for my opponents argument. points to con for his outstanding rebuttal.', \"My opponent… “The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people's rights.” Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women). You stated that you were pro sex-education and the main point of sex education is abstinence and sexual awareness so what is expected of the sexual education teacher to teach? Sex is just fine no matter what age? Only protected sex is okay? Abstinence is the best way of preventing pregnancy unless you feel differently? The main reason society looks down on or even rejects promiscuity is because many are taught abstinence from a young age and they are taught abstinence from a young age to help women from being thrown into a situation they never planned to be in. “Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society.” Again, a big point teachers make in sexual health classes is the fact abstinence is the best choice until marriage. If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. “Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girl’s appearance or behavior.” The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. My arguments First of all I would like to clarify that promiscuity in both males and females is wrong but for the sake of this debate I will argue how and why it is wrong in females. Unexpected Pregnancy One major social issue our society deals with is abortion. While some are pro-life and some are pro-choice I think it is clear we can all agree that abortion should be at least the last resort. The most effective way to prevent abortions is not getting pregnant and the most effective way to not get pregnant is abstinence. Effects of Unexpected Pregnancy The majority of the women who get pregnant before they are married will not end up getting married. This of course leads a huge burden on the mother having to deal with. According to the U.S Census Bureau %27.3 of single parents live in poverty. Also, the effects of children growing up without a parent can be drastic… Drinking problems.Teenagers living in single-parent households are more likely to abuse alcohol and at an earlier age compared to children reared in two-parent households Suicidal Tendencies.In a study of 146 adolescent friends of 26 adolescent suicide victims, teens living in single-parent families are not only more likely to commit suicide but also more likely to suffer from psychological disorders, when compared to teens living in intact families. Disturbing news:Children of never-married mothers are more than twice as likely to have been treated for an emotional or behavioral problem. Expelled:Nationally, 15.3 percent of children living with a never-married mother and 10.7 percent of children living with a divorced mother have been expelled or suspended from school, compared to only 4.4 percent of children living with both biological parents. College odds:Children from disrupted families are 20 percent more unlikely to attend college than kids from intact, two-parent families. Criminal Behavior:The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later criminal behavior. In the case of a teenage mother, the absence of a father also increases the risk of harshness from the mother.Seventy-two percent of adolescent murderers grew up without fathers. Sixty percent of America's rapists grew up the same way. As you can see promiscuity can lead to unwanted pregnancy which leads on to abortions and fatherless kids which carries out to more drastic measures such as the statistics mentioned above. Spread of STD’s Another result from promiscuity is the spread of STD’s. Often enough promiscuous women having unprotected sex will contract an STD. The woman could have it without knowing which is putting potential future partners at risk. Sad but true... A woman who is sexually promiscuous is more likely to be raped then a woman who is not. I am not saying that all rape victims are promiscuous or victim blaming in any way but a woman who dresses sexually provocative is more likely to be targeted by a rapist. Although it is not the victims fault in any way, women should make sure to be away and use protective measures to reduce the chance of falling victim to predators. I have proved that promiscuity leads to terrible things such as unexpected pregnancy, STD’s, and even rape. It is obvious that in today’s society men and women are held at double standards but I feel it is fair to say promiscuity is harmful regardless of your gender. I look forward to my opponents rebuttal :) http://www.policymic.com... http://www.photius.com...\", \"My proposed debate is based on the social paradigm that women shouldn't indulge in casual or frecuent sex, and those who do be frowned upon by society. I will be arguing CON, which means I will defend women having the right to practice sex freely without being discriminated or condenmed.\", 'My opponent stated:\"Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women).

If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. \"I believe there has been a misunderstanding regarding the terminology. The point of sex-education is not abstinence. The point of sex education is to reduce risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, and equip individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexual activity. What my opponent is referring to is called abstinence-only sexual education, an obsolete approach that focuses solely on abstinence as a tool to fight unhealthy sex practices. What I am proposing is called comprehensive sex education, which also adds the options of contraceptives, safe sex and non vaginal sex practices. Of course, at first glance, abstinence seems like the better choice, for it is a 100% certain way to avoid pregnancy and STD\\'s. Nevertheless, it has been proven to be very inefficient as an approach to sex education: Abstinence-only sex education has been found to be ineffective in decreasing the HIV risk in the developed world. [1] Abstinence-only sex education has also been found to increase unplanned pregnancy. [2] The concept of no premarital sex is evidently flawed, for it completely neglects the issues for individuals to whom marriage is not valued or desired, not to mention those for whom it\\'s not allowed (specifically LGBT). It distorts information, revealing only the failure rates of contraceptives and not their high success rates and benefits. [3] The whole approach is focused on a compulsory dogma of chastity, rather than an informed decision taking methodology, unsuitable with our free thinking society. Why should abstinence be regarded as the one and only way to prevent sex related problems? Why not tell teenagers that the average condom has a 98% success rate when used correctly, or that the contraceptive pill has a 99.7% success rate? [4] Why should they be discouraged from practicing non vaginal sexual activities such as anal sex, mutual masturbation or oral sex? If there are efficient ways to practice sex with relative safety, the social paradigm is pointless. The truth is that \"slut shaming\" is not a matter of public health as much as it is a matter of sexism and socio-religious principle. My opponent claims:\"The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. \"My case is not against prevention. It all depends on how the advise is presented. Of course women should not get in strangers\\' cars or accept beverages handed to them by unknowns. We must accept the fact that sick individuals exist, and they should be handled as the threat they are. We must raise consciousness the same way we would advert a kid against a pedophile. What I find offensive is when females are told they shouldn\\'t dress in a particular way, or that they should build up an image of chastity for themselves in order to reduce the risk of rape. This is almost like endorsing the animalistic instincts of some degenerates, treating them as poor souls tempted by desire instead of the degenerate criminals they are. As to my opponent\\'s arguments, they all derive from pregnancy and STD\\'s, let us go deeper: Undesired Pregnancy. I share my opponent\\'s opinion on the disadvantages of this issue. However, I don\\'t see how it\\'s a valid reason to indulge in hatred and discrimination of promiscuous women. As it\\'s already been discussed, there are ways to live an active safe life and avoid pregnancy. It is absurd to condemn someone over the mere possibility of pregnancy. Why should a girl who has successfully avoided pregnancy by the correct use of contraceptives be victim of bigotry in the hands of society? It is not fair. Similarly, there are women who accept the responsibility of their mistakes, and become caring and loving mothers. These brave women shouldn\\'t fall under the judgemental eye of society either. A group can never, ever be judged based on the behavior of some of its individuals, this means all promiscuous females should not be judged on the behalf of their irresponsible peers. So, instead of judging promiscuity, society should put the pressure over irresponsibility. In other words, as long as the woman is not causing the social damages of giving birth to an unwanted child and neglecting him or her, she has no reason to be criticised. Sexually Transmitted Diseases. This is even less of a reason to endorse \"slut shaming\". Again, people who are promiscuous but have taken measures to remain clean have no reason to be frowned upon. Assuming people received the appropriate sex education my case is arguing for, there should be no doubts concerning the risks of sexual acts. If one party decides to engage in a sex act with another party, he or she does it in full understanding of the risk that implies getting infected. Contrarily, if a person unknowingly contracts a disease it is not a problem of promiscuity but of sexual ignorance. Finally, I will address the portion of the debate where my opponent argues promiscuity is a cause of rape, and should therefore be rejected. Let me reduce this un-cited argument with an example. It is known that middle and high class citizens are more likely to be targeted by kidnappers. Do we ask them to stop earning money? Do we judge them for having large amounts of money? No, it would be illogical, they make money because they obtain pleasure from it. The same applies to our issue: women should be careful, the same way affluent individuals take safety measures to prevent kidnapping, but they should not be told to give up an active sex life just to prevent rape. Moreover, this debate is not about promiscuity being right or wrong, or about the pros and cons of abstinence versus promiscuity. This debate is about women having a right to practice sex freely, without being discriminated. It needs to be understood that the mere fact of having frequent and casual sex has no immoral value on its own. It\\'s an issue of the tolerance and acceptance (not necessarily approval) that these women deserve. Sources:[1] Underhill, K; Operario, D, Montgomery, P (2007 Oct 17). Operario, Don. ed. \"Abstinence-only programs for HIVinfection prevention in high-income countries\"[2] Kohler, Pamela; Lafferty, William (2008 Apr). \"Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy\". Journal of Adolescent Health[3] Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006[4] \"Planned Parenthood IUD Birth Control\" - Mirena IUD', 'Thank you for accepting my challenge, I hope it\\'s an enlightening debate.To clarify what i am debating against, I will introduce an unofficial but popular term that describes my case perfectly: \"Slut shaming\" is defined as the act of making a woman feel guilty or inferior for engaging in sexual behaviors that violate traditional expectations. [1] Observe:In its declaration of sexual rights, the World Health Organization (the public health branch of the United Nations) states:Sexual rights embrace human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other consensus documents. These include the right of all persons, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, to:the highest attainable standard of health in relation to sexuality, including access to sexual and reproductive health care services;seek, receive and impart information in relation to sexuality;sexuality education;respect for bodily integrity;choice of partner;decide to be sexually active or not;consensual sexual relations;consensual marriage;decide whether or not, and when to have children; andpursue a satisfying, safe and pleasurable sexual life. [2].Let us examine some particular points, like \"right to decide to be sexually active or not\", \"right to consensual sexual relations\", and the \"right to pursue a satisfying safe and pleasurable sexual life\". The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people\\'s rights. This means that if a woman finds it sexually satifying and pleasurable to lead a promiscous life style, she should be allowed to do so without any form of discrimination or social disproval, for she is only excerting the sexual rights mentioned above.Please note that I am not advocating for a society that encourages promiscuity, less one that promotes unprotected sex or other unsafe sexual practices. I am in favor of sex education (in fact, the delcaration states that as a right). My debate only rises from the common conception that a promiscuity in women is something rejectable and that deserves social criticism (whereas promiscuity in men is usually admired and even encouraged.) Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society. Why should a woman who choses to have sex automatically be relegated to a lower social category? Why should sexually active men prefer virgins over sexually active women? It is unfair, and should not be accepted under any circumstance.This phenomenum causes many social illnesses, like rape culture, victim blaming, sexual bullying and objectification, based on the belief that a woman who choses to live an active sex life is not worthy of respect, and just represents a source of pleasure for men. Not only are women judged on their sex lives, but also on the clothes they wear, the places they visit, or the partners they engage with. This constitutes an essential violation of human rights, for no person should be discrimintaed on the basis of gender [3]. Women should be allowed to chose how they dress, what places to visit and how many times they have sex without being frowned upon or objectified. Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girls appearence or behavior. Women should not be told to dress conservative in order to \"get respect\", respect should be inherent, and men should be expected to respect any woman, regardless of her looks.Sources:[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://www.un.org...[3] http://www.upsettingrapeculture.com...', \"What you're arguing about is completely off what the title suggests 'Both Christianity and Islam encourage excessive cruelty to animals' means that the ideology that the person follows encourages the follower to torture animals, and be excessively cruel towards them. Thus far, all you've proven is how many farms are owned by Christians / Muslims, and statistics shown about how much meat is consumed by people who follow Christianity / Islam. You haven't proven how each ideology promotes excessive amounts of cruelty to animals, you've only shown how much meat is eaten and how many farms are owned by people who follow each religion. There has been no evidence about the Bible or the Quran, no criticism of the ideology, and nothing about excessive cruelty. You've only criticized the people, of the religion and not the religion itself. Needless to say, your statements have only been promoting veganism, and only proves about the excessive amount of meat eaten, which is an entirely different topic from this, and not a single word about how each religion promotes animal cruelty. Christians work in factories + Factories are cruel to animals = Christianity promotes cruelty. This is your logic and reasoning behind it as far as I can tell, which only adresses the people, but not the ideology. You also mentioned how the factory farming industry is cruel. Yet, this doesn't equate at all to how Christianity or Islam promotes excessive cruelty towards animals, and have strayed completely off topic. You said that referring to the text for each religion would result in bias. That means that you haven't argued the topic AT ALL. For the part about turning Christians into vegetarians / vegans, you're doing nothing more than forcing your own ideals onto other people, which obviously doesn't work, and losing your faith over such a thing. Like how people complain about Christians shoving Christianity down their throats, you have been doing the same with veganism.

Thanks for debating.\", \"I fully know what you are trying to say, that to this day, christians and muslims are putting animal sacrifices into practice though it has been abolished for centuries. This may be the case for Islam, but what about Christianity? In your example, you didn't give any direct quotes from the bible, or any real life cases about the topic related to Christianity. The bible doesn't encourage EXCESSIVE cruelty to animals, it says to end them quickly. And animal sacrifices for Christianity have been long put out of practice, by the bible itself. And your comment on looking at the actions of people rather than the belief. Since in the title you are criticizing the ideology (christian / Islam) rather than the people (christian / muslim), the statement made about looking at the people's actions is irrelevant, considering this is a conversation about an ideology, rather than the people. By the looks of what your statement said, a more fitting title would be 'Muslims encourage excessive cruelty towards animals'.\", 'Though I am extremely anti - Islam (due to the fact they encourage violence to all non believers rather than just non - innocent people), I can\\'t find evidence relating to how they are cruel to animals.

It is well known that Christianity is around 70% in the USA and factory farming is rampant the USA. [3]99% of animals are raised on factory farms in the USA. [4] The majority of USA citizens are Christian. 99% of animals raised in the USA are from factory farms. Factory farming is infamous for its terrible cruelty. Therefore there is a strong positive relationship between Christianity and factory farming. I can only come to the conclusion that Christianity causes animal cruelty. As for other religions, this may also be true, but is a red herring. If religion x causes cruelty to animals, this won\\'t change the fact that Christianity causes cruelty to animals. As for judging a religion by its religious texts, I\\'ve already gone over this in this debate any many others. Religious texts have many contradictory passages. Since people are self motivated they often select the passage that benefits them the most, using conformation bias to ignore the contradictory passage. \"Gee, God says animals don\\'t have souls, gave us souls, gave us dominion over animals, Jesus ate fish, and Jesus said it was moral to eat meat.\" Completely overlooking the anti-cruelty passages. If I had to point to one event that turned me from a Christian to an agnostic it is this.Nevermind that the body is a temple of the holy spirit. That if you defile your body God will destroy you. Oh no, Jesus ate one fish so then we can rationalize every single misdeed we perform to animals based upon this. I just found it was impossible to convince Christians to turn vegetarian. I honestly lost my faith arguing vegan issues with Christians on this debate site.

You can make point A and then complete opposite from a different passage in the same religious texts. Which then leads to confirmation bias. A reader will then pick which side of the topic to follow based upon his/her person agenda and bias. Therefore, we must judge how a religion treats animals based upon the actions of its followers. As already seen in r1, Christians an Muslims tend to treat animals horribly. Note this same train of thought could be made for violence. That religion x states in part A of its religious texts peace and part B war. That means a person following the religion will pick whatever benefits him/her the most. Finally, to really determine how a religion treats animals, we must compare the actions of followers of various religions. That way we can see how they stack up. Overall, Christianity and Islam treat animals much worse than Hinduism and Buddhism. Also, note many animal rights activist gravitate towards atheism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Which also shows that these religions have more respect for animals. Thanks for debating.', 'More and more I am seeing little use for either of these religions in modern day. Perhaps in a past era these ideas were necessary to survive. Yet, with no evidence of God I am beginning to question a religion who claims a supreme being created these morals, yet is very cruel to animals. I think it is well known about the Christian capitalistic factory farms. The old testament Kosher slaughtering of animals. That Christians can morally use animals for food, clothing, and experimentation. Yet, what about the newcomer to the western world? Is Islam any better? No, in many ways Islam is just as bad if not worse. I. Ritual slaughter\"Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law.

Discrimination against dogs. \"Muslim countries, in particular, are rife with unimaginable cruelty toward animals. Walid Shoebat has been chronicling horrific cases of Muslim animal abuse. Below are two recent examples:#1: In Iran, government gets rid of stray dogs by injecting them with acid. Acid is chosen because it is the least expensive poison, but the method is cruel because it consigns the dog to a painful and slow death, as the acid slowly corrodes the dog’s guts.\" [2]This is heart breaking for anyone who loves animals.

As for your recommendations that we forgo our responses to show the strength of our arguments, that seems like a tactic aimed at winning based on votes, which I am against. If we are to debate, we should win based on the validity and strength of our arguments, not necessarily on tricks to convince voters. Besides, your opponent, no matter how terrible, deserves a response. It\\'s just plain courtesy. All in all, your suggestion to be able to \"forego\" rounds is just a slower version of my conceding or voiding debates. There\\'s no reason to choose to forego rounds as opposed to conceding or voiding. You also recommended extending debate time to busy opponents. I find this to be a bad idea because we would have a floating debate making absolutely no progress. I find this to be a problem already. Currently, it would take 3 days per round to end a debate that has come to a standstill. Your suggestion would make it even longer. With my method, all you do is void the debate and start it again when your opponent isn\\'t so busy. That way, no one\\'s scores get hurt, there\\'s no unnecessary voting, and we free forum space. Your final point about lengthening the number of rounds, I\\'m so-so about. While it seems good in theory, there really should be a limit. Debate is about putting your points forward as succinctly as possible, not who gets the last post or who\\'s the most long-winded. Adding in extra rounds may be more enjoyable to debaters, but not to voters or spectators. And it definitely takes away from the integrity of debate. If we implement these ideas of yours, debates would definitely be longer, but not necessarily better. I\\'m trying to improve quality by trimming out the crappy debates (when one person leaves, when one person concedes, when one person just doesn\\'t want to respond or can\\'t respond, etc.) Your suggestions prioritize quantity over quality. Bad debates don\\'t need to be longer, and good debates don\\'t need to be dragged on forever. That would make them bad.', \"I won't get too flowery with this opening statement. There are many instances where a person may start a debate and not be able to finish it. Schoolwork, family emergencies, etc. These can interfere with a debate. In addition, a person may have made a fatal error in judgment, or realized that an opponent's point cannot be countered. I believe that there should be two extra options: 1. Concede debate. This automatically takes you out of the debate. The benefit of this is that in a multi-round debate, if you find you cannot win, or want to concede for any other reason, you don't force the rest of the site to wait 3 days per round before they can vote. 2. Void debate This sends a request to the opponent to void the debate. In this case, there are no winners and the debate is deleted. Thus, a person cannot be voted for unfairly if the opponent has encountered some emergency.\", 'But I would argue it does. If the supernatural is either impossible or meaningless, it cannot exist. If it is impossible then it is impossible. But what does it mean to say \"the supernatural exists\" if one accepts it\\'s meaningless? It means nothing. Thus as it means nothing the supernatural lacks any possibility of being true. Yes we have limits on our knowledge, but one would need unlimited knowledge to make an appeal to magic when confronted by seemingly inexplicable events. It is an argument stemming from our lack of knowledge. A reversal of the theist claim that I would need to be omniscient to rule out the supernatural.', 'Thank you for your response. If supernaturalism is only meaningful in the context of negating natural causes and it is impossible for us to know that natural causes have been negated. It follows that supernaturalism is impossible and therefore false. A theist could take the defence of stating that the supernatural is meaningless and therefore not even false, but whilst that may be open to the theist position it hardly seems to improve it. Apologies if that was not clear from the premises. Is it clear now or do you believe I have missed a step here? P1 is probably the premise to attack.', 'To rule in the supernatural, we need a transcendent knowledge base precisely because our knowledge is limited to begin with. And since supernatural effects can only be deduced if one has no limits of knowledge, then naturalism is absolute. We can express both lines of evidence in this way: P1) Supernaturalism is only meaningful in that it is a negation of material causes.

(from P1, P2 and P3) C2) Naturalism is an absolute. (from C1) P1) through P2) Human knowledge is limited. Naturalism and naturalistic causes are assumed in each and every example of human experience, through a process of induction and an appeal to the simplest possible explanation. Supernatural explanations are always more complex as they invoke mysterious, un-knowable, mystical agents. There is a 3 step approach we can consider: Step 1) if we see a potentially supernatural event we first question of the validity of the observation, equipment, method and approach. If this completely rules out a natural explanation we go to step 2) Step 2) we question as to whether a new area of science has opened up and look to establish repeatable observations, and assess them through an explanatory natural framework. If we can rule out this possibility we go to step 3) Step 3) we are left in a meaningless position because of we can only rule in a supernatural explanation, anything could be happening to our sense and reasoning and there is no way to determine truth To overturn this and rule in the supernatural, we need a transcendent knowledge base precisely because our knowledge is limited to begin with.

You appear to contradict yourself in stating: R1) \"Well, congratulations on proving it is not meaningful. However, you didn\\'t prove it was impossible...[snip]...\"; then R4) \"...[snip]...All we proved is that super-naturalism isn\\'t a definitive cause. That doesn\\'t show it\\'s meaningless...[snip]...\" To summarise the debate, I have tried to argue that the Supertnatural is impossible - because it is not possible for humans to ever know whether it applies. Humans are obliged to argue for naturalism as an absolute. The challenge presented in R1 - R3 was that one could argue that the argument only concludes the supernaturalism is meaningless, but still possible. I have to conclude that if the supernatural is meaningless, then in a sense it is in a worse position of being \\'not even possible\\'. Thanks again for the exchange.', 'Yes of course I see your point. But I struggle to make sense out of your analysis of this. Impossibility would presuppose a zero chance of being possible. Being possible would presuppose a likelihood. A likelihood would presuppose there being something with attributes to be likely. But, meaninglessness entails that the attributes of something are without meaning, they/it mean nothing. If something means nothing it has no attributes that make it ikely in the first place, if it has no likelihood it has no possibility, and is therefore impossible. I suppose a simpler rejoinder is what does it mean to say \"the supernatural is meaningless, but still possible\"?', 'Still, this did not rule out the possibility of supernatural existence. It just showed it was not possible to prove definitely. You said it yourself. We have limits to our knowledge. We can not rule out anything as impossible.

You did not affirm the resolution.\", \"I thought that you meant meaningless as in it is impossible to prove, not that it is impossible. All Pro has done is prove that it is impossible to know if a cause was supernatural. How that translates into supernaturalism being impossible is a mystery. In fact, Pro's own reasoning is his own downfall. Since we don't know the cause, we can't rule out supernaturalism. Somehow, we are obliged to still say that naturalism has to be the answer. It may be the likely answer, but without proof either way, it remains a 50-50 chance.\", \"Wait, I think we have a confusion. All we proved is that super-naturalism isn't a definitive cause. That doesn't show it's meaningless. It is in the sense that it is an unproven answer, but not that it serves no purpose.\", \"Precisely since it stems from our ignorance is why it can't be disproven.

Meaningfulness has nothing to do with this debate.\", 'My opponent has made no arguments. As Instigator and Pro he has the burden of proof. I have given six well-documented reasons why the legislation is not justified. The resolution therefore fails.', 'My opponent made no case and no rebuttal. The resolution is negated.', 'Pro picked a good topic, because cap and trade legislation is said to be next on Obama\\'s agenda. It\\'s a shame that Pro had nothing to say about the subject. Pro failed to define \"justification\" or to offer any proof that the legislation passed by the House meets any standard of justification. I will assume that \"justified\" means having \"having benefits outweighing its costs.\" 1. The theory of global warming crisis is at this point proved largely invalid, so there is no climate justification. CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, so that increased CO2 causes some global warming. The physics of carbon dioxide are such that doubling the present amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would produce about 1.5 degrees of temperature rise. That\\'s comparable to past prosperous warm periods like the Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was named for its greenery, and the Holocene Optimum, about 6000 years ago when civilizations rose in the Middle East. Global warming crisis theorists claim secondary effects in the atmosphere multiply the CO2 effect to crisis proportions, causing not just 1.5 degrees of warming, but 4.5 degrees of warming or more. The claim was based upon the warming that occurred from 1970 to 1995. Crisis theorists claimed that there was nothing else going on affecting climate: no solar effects, no volcanoes, no ocean cycles ... nothing except the rise in CO2. Therefore, they argued, there must be a multiplying effect for the CO2. The disproof is that even the UN now admits that there has been no global warming for the past 15 years, yet CO2 has continued to increase. If there is nothing else going on, as crisis theorists continue to claim, why have the predictions failed? Clearly there *is* something going on that is at least as important as CO2 effects. In fact, it is probably a combination of several factors such as multiple ocean cycles adding, a lack of volcanic activity (that causes cooling), and lower cosmic ray activity (that provides cloud seeding). In addition, analysis of \"natural experiments\" where CO2 has increased locally shows that the effects of CO2 are as the physics predicts, and are not multiplied. http://www.junkscience.com... Also see the book \"Chill\" by Peter Taylor for a discussion of the recent science. 2. Let\\'s assume for debate purposes that there is a CO2 crisis, and also that the legislation will work exactly as proposed, an extremely unlikely outcome. Even under those assumptions, computer models developed by the Government for the purpose of justifying the legislation show that the reduction in temperature rise would be only 0.05 C. http://gwswindle.blogspot.com... It is in the realm of a symbolic act to appease climate gods. If one believes in climate crisis, the right approach to fixing the problem lies in climate engineering. Climate engineering solutions could provide and actual cure, and do not pose all the international challenges and disastrous consequences posed by cap and trade. http://www.newscientist.com... 3. Cap and trade is not justified because it formalizes a system of payoffs. The system takes money from people who need to heat and cool their homes and from industries that provide jobs and gives it to a vast enforcement bureaucracy, to politicians who use it to dispense favors, and to middlemen who make a fortune trading the credits. Politicians control who suffers and who gets the riches. It has been tried in Europe, with widespread corruption the result. http://online.wsj.com... The system makes the middlemen trading credits rich. It the US, a prime trading beneficiary would be General Electric. http://thecommonconservative.com... GE has given huge support the Obama and the Democrats. They will be paid off handsomely for their support. The corruption is inherent. \"The cap-and-trade system being touted on Capitol Hill would create a multibillion-dollar playground that would, once again, create a group of wealthy traders benefiting at the expense of millions of average families—middle to low-income households that would end up paying more for food, energy, and almost everything else they buy.\" http://www.usnews.com... 4. Cap-and-trade will have an insignificant effect on global CO2 emissions. Europe has had both cap and trade and subscription to the Kyoto Protocol. The US has neither, but the US emission history is better. \"In recent years, despite all efforts following the Kyoto Summit, CO2 emissions have been rising more steeply in Europe than in the U.S.A. Like it or not, those are the hard facts.\" http://www.leonardo-energy.org... 5. Cap-and-trade causes industry to shift out of the developed world into the lesser developed countries, so even the tiny reductions in CO2 promised will not be achieved. In Europe, a third of their CO2 emission are transferred out. http://www.theecologist.org... In the US, California has its own green energy initiatives that dramatically increased energy costs. The result so far is that half the industry has moved out of the state. Nationwide cap and trade legislation would punish energy-intensive heavy industry in America, moving it China, India, and other countries that refuse to destroy their economies with exorbitant energy prices. http://hotair.com... \"According to an analysis of climate legislation performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the cap-and-trade system favored by President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats could potentially damage the U.S. manufacturing sector and force jobs to move overseas. ... s the EPA states: \"A cap-and-trade policy increases the price of energy-intensive goods. The majority of this price increase is ultimately passed onto consumers. … [L]ower income households are disproportionately affected by a GHG (Green House Gas) cap-and-trade policy because they spend a higher fraction of their incomes on energy-intensive goods.\"\" http://www.cnsnews.com... 6. In an odd twist, cap and trade may actual increase CO2 emissions, by making conversion to natural gas uneconomic. Improvements in technology have made supplies of natural gas cheaper and more abundant. Gas burns producing less CO2 than coal, so initially it seems that cap and trade would benefit the gas industry. However, to win approval in coal producing states, Democrats included special dispensations for the coal states. (It\\'s like the Pope giving out indulgences in the Middle Ages.) In a free market for energy, cheaper natural gas would displace coal over time, reducing CO2 emissions. But under the proposed legislation, carbon credits go to coal and not to natural gas, keeping coal viable where is would ordinarily be displaced. Cap and trade is unjustified because it would have no significant effect on global warming and might even increase it; it will dramatically increase energy costs to consumers for the benefit of the politically favored, and it will drive jobs and industry other countries. \" ... estimates of job losses attributable to cap-and-trade range in the hundreds of thousands. The price for energy paid by the American consumer also will rise. The studies reviewed showed electricity prices jumping 5-15% by 2015, natural gas prices up 12-50% by 2015, and gasoline prices up 9-145% by 2015.\" http://www.usnews.com... There is no justification. The resolution is negated.', 'Sorry about the forfeit KFC', 'I will let my opponent go first. \"resolved that the cap and trade legislation of 2009 was justified\" may the force be with you', 'Your argument is good, your points are well made, and I have just realized one thing. That is, that each of us agree that education and punishment should be balanced, right? Now that I have isolated the things that we agree on, we can look at more concerning matters. Harlan: \"I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring.\" Can I just say, that criminals decide to donate their organs, as with the case of the gang leader in Singapore. He said to his wife and mistress that he wanted to donate his organs. After he was hanged, the organs were given to needy people, saving at least 5 lives. Harlan: \"You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life.\" Harlan, do judges really put them in for life? Face the reality, they will not be put in for life. After another 10-20 years, they\\'ll come out and kill more. \\'One-third of the nation\\'s executions take place in Texas—and the steepest decline in homicides has occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which together account for nearly half the nation\\'s executions.\\' That is a good point made by whoever made that. Harlan: \"\\'Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\\' Well, too bad. It\\'s their job.\" I can point out that people can find new jobs. Harlan: \"Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness.\" If everyone was as narrow-minded as Harlan, people would kill more openly, knowing that they won\\'t be jailed up for long. Knowing that they will be out soon. To do it all again. Thats usually/always the case. \\'Two gun\\' Crowley: \"Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do no body any harm.\" And when Crowley arrived at the electric chair, did he say: \"This is what I get for killing?\". No. He said: \"This is what I get for defending myself.\" Al Capone: \"I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" So I would like to conclude, that I reckon that education and punishment should be used together with greater effectiveness and greater efficiency. The death sentence will be used in appropriate situations. But if possible, be deterred. Therefore, the death sentence should stay, and be used under certain circumstances. Also, alright has one L.', 'The Contender has many flaws in his argument. Firstly, \"Harlan\" says \"I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear.\" This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases. The other half of his point tells us that he would like to see more \"education\" rather \"than fear\". I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose? A famous gangster and killer called Al Capone once said \"I have spent the best of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" Yes. Thats the word of the most feared gang leader in Chicago. As you can see, criminals don\\'t see how they are wrong, and they won\\'t see how they are wrong through \"education\". Men like Al Capone think like that. There is no way of escaping that fact. Secondly, \"Harlan\" doesn\\'t get the point of a death sentence. Here are his words: \"Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs.\" So what \"Harlan\" is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \"kill more people in order to get organs\". Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment. The organ donation is just a way of a \\'repayment\\' of the people they\\'ve killed etc. And also, only healthy organs will be chosen (I would also like to add that healthy blood can also be donated). And as \"Harlan\" said:\" I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized.\" This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person. Why doesn\\'t \"Harlan\" feel sorry for those who were killed? Why, \"Harlan\"? Thirdly, \"Harlan\" says: \"The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one.\" This proves that \"Harlan\" does not understand the point. I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues. And as \"Harlan\" says: \"Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution.\" Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe. And also, \"Harlan\" still doesn\\'t get the point. The death sentence is a fair punishment for a an \"attrocious\" crime. \"Harlan\" is relating the death sentence as a way of getting rid of people. That\\'s not my point! And even more important, isn\\'t a \"mental institution\" just another phrase for \"jail\"? They do have rehabilitation places in prisons you know. And lastly, \"Harlan\" says: \"There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary.\" This proves again that \"Harlan\" does not understand. We are not trying to get rid of people. We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood. We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population. We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done. And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument.', \"There once was a man who killed a couple of people, went into jail, came out to kill more people, went back in again, and killed more people after coming out. There wouldn't have been so many deaths if a death sentence was introduced. This may seem inhumane, but since when did killing people become humane? In some countries, there is no death sentence, and since there isn't, it should be introduced. First of all, death sentences reduce the number of cold criminals behind bars. They carried out serious offences, now they have to pay the price, it all seems pretty normal. Secondly, the organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them. This is a good way to repay all the lives that the criminal has killed. Thirdly, a death sentence introduced could decrease the number of murders every year. When pre-criminals hear that a death sentence is being introduced, they usually stop. This is a good way to stop serious assault and murder and a way to save lives. Thus the death sentence should be introduced to countries who don't have such a law.\", 'You know you don\\'t need to put my name in quotation marks. Allright, my opponent\\'s rebuttal was quite lengthy so I will answer each of his points in turn. \"This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases.\" This is false. Punishment does not necessarily mean death. Punishment can mean exile, jail, a fine, or even public service. You have twisted my words around so that the punishment means death. That\\'s a cheap card to play, man. \"I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose?\" I would like to clarify that I am in no way suggesting that education will completely eliminate all crime. And likewise, the fear of being punished will also (and does) not eliminate all crime. By citing a single incident of education failing to discourage a man from crime in no way proves that education is completely useless in the effort of decreasing crime. If I so pleased, I could do the same thing with your method of decreasing crime via fear, by citing incidents of people going on killing sprees despite the fact that they will almost certainly wind up in prison or in the electric chair. But regardless of the effectiveness of education when compared to fear, it must be acknowledged that education is a better foundation for society than fear. It creates a healthier atmosphere, and makes the populace moral people, rather than immoral people who are scared to act out their immoral ideas. And once more, I am not saying that punishment should be completely eliminated, I am saying that a balance should be made, with alot of emphasis on education, and less emphasis on punishment. \"So what \\'Harlan\\' is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \\'kill more people in order to get organs\\'. Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\" Here you go again twisting my words. I never said that the death sentence is in place for any purpose. This is a hypothetical debate (see resolution), and has nothing to do with any death-sentence policy that exists in real life. I was merely responding to your hypothetical death-sentence ideas, which you happened to justify on the basis that \"organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them\" (see round 1). Those are your words, not mine. What you have done in the above quote is completely changed your argument to \"The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\", while completely ignoring my rebuttal to your original point (the one you just pretended you didn\\'t make), which was that the felon\\'s organs could be used. \"This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person.\" It\\'s not so much a matter of \"feeling sorry\", as you have twisted my words to say, as it is honoring every Human being\\'s fundamental rights, regardless of their personality. Once more, 2 wrongs do not make a right, and with that in mind it can be said that it is not justified to deny a fellow Human being of his rights, no matter what the scenario is. I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring. \"Why doesn\\'t \\'Harlan\\' feel sorry for those who were killed?\" Where could you have possibly made this conclusion out of anything that I said in round 1? Now you are simply making up stuff that I said. \"I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues.\" Once more, this is a problem that has a simple and practical solution: don\\'t release them. You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life. \"Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\" Well, too bad. It\\'s their job. \"We are not trying to get rid of people.\" Neither of us said this. \"We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood.\" Those were your words, not mine. \"We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population.\" I never said this either. \"We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done.\" Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness. \"And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument.\" Fine, if we ARE playing that game, then I guess I\\'ll play too. In the above quote, his first sentence did not need a comma and should have had a quotation mark instead of a period, since it was phrased as a question. Also (I wasn\\'t going to say anything, but I suppose I will), he misquoted Al Capone earlier. -Harlan', 'My opponent has 3 main parts to his argument. I will answer each of these in turn. 1. That the Criminals have to \"pay the price\". It is a commonly accepted moral concept that two wrongs do not make a right. Basicaly, immoral acts are never warranted, even when the victim of said acts is inhumane and immoral to the extreme. The moral aspects of this ideology are obviously flawed. The only practical aspect of this is idea is that it may discourage people from performing horrible acts. I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear. 2. The organs of felons could be harvested and put into the bodies of other people. Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs. Furthermore, I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized. Or at least consent from the family. It also seems unlikely to me that the sort of people who end up getting the death sentance are people who are very healthy. 3. It would decrease the # of murders. The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one. And even if this were a genuine problem, the most serious of prisoners (that might have people on the outside who could break them out), could simply put in a higher security prison, such as alkatraz. This seems like a practical and humane solution to the same problem. Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution. There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary. And while it would be more efficient, it is inhumane. It is not absolutely necessary, and therefore it should be avoided, considering the matter at hand.', 'Health care is a hot topic right now. I would love to have debated whatever facet the instigator offered. He refused. 1. I asked for definitions and Con refused. 2. I asked for clarification on broad terms and Con refused. I cannot debate the Pro side of a topic the instigator refuses to define and clarify. When a new debater offers a debate with vague terms, I generally attack whatever premise can be culled and I ask for definitions and sources. This method allows for a solid round 2 and a chance to offer a conclusion. I was more than fair in this debate. I am sorry to voters that Con insisted on using broad terms so as to move the definition when challenged. The best method to deal with rhetoric is to force the user to provide definitions for the offered terms. Con simply refused to define his position, so I had no need to present mine. He formed the debate; he posts the requested information. I was not asking for much, just some support and some definitions for the terms he decided to use so I could clash with them. I challenged the few positions Con offered and none deal with \"health care\". I recommend Con try much harder next time. Con offered nothing but rhetoric and hot buttons words, but still finds the need to compare me to a politician. Con is experiencing psychological projection here as politicians avoid direct answers and, generally, refuse to define terms. The Pro/Con here is not relevant. Con instigated a debate and refused to clarify the resolution or provide some context and meaning to the used terms. I cannot be forced to support a burden for a position that the instigator refused to define.', 'I thank Con for his response and I want to be clear that I am not trying to be difficult. I ask for definitions so I can see your full point and I can avoid misunderstandings. At this point, Con has only used hot button terms like \"big government\". I enjoy debating not punditry. Television personalities like Hannity and Olberman enjoy throwing out vague terms so they can change the definition when a guest responses well. I have no time for such nonsense. I asked for definitions and Con refused to provide them. I asked for sources and Con made little effort to supply them. Am I asking too much? I will try to deal with Con\\'s response. Con agrees the government has run the military efficiently so the statement referencing the government\\'s inability to run anything is refuted. Con then moves the goal posts on me and now claims, \"There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military.\" Ok, I don\\'t use the word \"absolutely\" in reference to future outcomes unless I am dealing with math, and even then I am cautious. If you would tell me what you mean by a government take over then we can talk. Do you mean regulations? Hospitals becoming government owned? Do mean government ran health care competing against private carriers? Are you talking about Medicare? How can I address such a vague point? The statement is simply rhetorical and has little meaning. Con follows with a statement referencing less government in healthcare right now. Well we do not have a universal health coverage plan currently so are you referencing current regulations? Medicare? Do you see the problem here, Con? You chose hot buttons \"big government\" and \"government take over\" and then referenced the present day situation. He states: \"The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way.\" \"If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to.\" This must be present day so how does it apply to current legislation in Congress which has not passed? Now if this is the case we can avoid any discussion about health care proposals, but Con goes further and asks for tort reform. He states: \"If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform.\" I thought you wanted less government involvement. Tort reform in reference to malpractice cases would require MORE involvement from the government, not less as tort law and damages is generally left up to the states, not the federal government. http://www.settlementcentral.com... This is one of the problems with allowing interstate commerce with insurance companies. Your proposal involves more federal control, not less. Why would you remove state involvement in torts, by claiming the federal government should step in and reform torts at a federal level all the while claiming you want less federal government? At this point, your rhetoric is contradictory so how can I debate an issue you refuse to define and go against a contradictory position? All I can do is point out the flaws in your position as I still have no idea what the Con position is saying. Con states: \"I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american (sic) but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true.\" This is an argument from ignorance and yes claims need support. If you are unwilling to support your arguments, don\\'t present them. I have no need to address this further. Con states: \"This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda.\" Did I mention Hannity already? This statement needs support. Define radical socialists, administration, and what exactly this \"administration\" has done concerning a furtherance of this \"radical socialist agenda.\" This is just hot button rhetoric and needs not be addressed further. Con must do better than right wing pundit talking points. \"First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government.\" If you would have defined socialism I could have addressed this point. Socialism is so broad that I cannot, in the space provided, explain all facets, but as instigator you certainly could have done so. You chose not to give us a definition so I have nothing to clash with at this point. \"Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate.\" On a dark and stormy night … not so much. President Obama spoke directly to Republicans concerning many issues in the health care debate. How is this in the cover of darkness? I can read all the legislation presented on this subject as it is publicly available. President Obama made clear when running for President that he supported universal coverage in reference to health care and would focus on implementing legislation in this respect. We all had a vote. We elected him. How is this secretive? More and more rhetoric, nothing solid here. I\\'m tired. The only point Con brought forward was a poll. He did not link the poll, the methodology, the margin of error, nothing. He said it was there. Rasmussen? I would love to view the methodology used and see the full results but unlike truly scientific polls, the results are hidden … unless you pay for them. \"All the data collected by Rasmussen Reports, not just the portion we make public.\" For 20 bucks a month, no thank you. http://www.rasmussenreports.com... Really? Talk about \"in the cover of darkness\". The instigator has offered very little here. I cannot address a contention unless it is defined. Rhetoric is for the mindless masses, I need facts and data, or at a minimum, definitions.', 'I wish him good luck. I stand in refutation to my opponent\\'s contentions and will address them. Con wrote, \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything. \" I disagree. Our government has run one of the most powerful armed forces in the world. As for dysfunctional government, I recommend Somalia. Next my opponent offers that health care, an ambiguous term, encompasses 1/6 of the US economy. I ask my opponent, as he is the instigator, to support this statement and I ask for a definition of economy in relation to this figure. I cannot attack a figure my opponent does not source. Define health care also please. Con offers polls, but offers…no polls! Show me and I will deal with them. He then offers some rhetoric in the form of \"cramming down our throats\". Cramming what? Be more specific. Tell me what the US government crammed down my throat. Con wants to hear from those who have blind faith in big government. I am not sure who these people are, but I support my government and as a former member of the greatest Air Force in the world, I swore my life to our defense. I no not support blind faith in any matters, religious or otherwise, and Con did not define big government or blind faith. At this point, the instigator has only offered one solid contention and that contention is that the US government cannot run anything, but I submit that the US military run by our government is the greatest in the world. I can do little more until the instigator presents a case with something more than rhetoric.', \"Wow, Pro is quite the technical debater. I have a lot of respect for his skills. To be honest I was expecting to have an ideological debate. I think Pro would make a fine politician. However, here is the problem as I see it. Americans hate politicians because they are masters at doing the same thing you are doing. They talk and talk about data and polls and margins of error and everyone is left with their heads spinning. It is a very calculated technique used to where down opposition until they just throw their hands up and say fine just do whatever. To use another sports analogy, I shoot and you block over and over again. This is a very safe way for you to win a debate and you most likely will but we still have little idea of why universal health is good for America. Instead of only blocking how about a shot. Pro chose to be pro on health care. So lets hear some pro commentary. Pro does not need to sit there on his high horse waiting for me to deliver the perfectly executed and statistical debate. Pro should just state where he stands. If Pro was a politician, what would his platform be. I want to hear why moving toward more government control of our health care is better. I believe the reason the health care bill is having so much trouble is because no one can really explain why and how it is better. Admittedly I spend most my time working so I do have time to hear or read everything but this is true with most Americans. So why doesn't Pro educate me and tell me and anyone who might read this what part of the health care monstrosity bill is good and what part is not. I will be honest about my ideology. Brace yourself because it is very radical. I want to return to the constitution. What is Pro's ideology.\", 'First of all I want to say that i love the US military. Pro is right it is a very functional part of government. However, I certainly would not put the military and government in the same category. They respond to executive commands from the feds but are a completely separate substructure to the government. It is made up of extremely talented and qualified personnel operating under a chain of command in a enviroment of extreme competition and accountablity. There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military. Besides the military is something that the citizens can not do for themselves. Health care on the other hand is. The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way. Abraham Lincoln said that \"The worst thing you can do for those you love is the things they could and should do themselves\". If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to. I can\\'t event buy health insurance across state lines if I want to. The solution is less government, not more. What if I went to my job and the more I screw up the more i was promoted. That would not make sense. So why with the feds we continue to give them more power the more they screw up? I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true. Just look at the debt we are in that we will never be able to get out of. Health care for everyone will only ad to this debt. If you believe universal health care will save us money than i have some beach front property i would like to sell you. If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform. This is not an accident. This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda. I\\'m not saying that socialism is a bad thing as long as everyone knows exactly how it works and what it is. First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government. If we are able to have an open and honest debate about how much government we want and Americans decide they want to move away from our founders had intended then I am ok with that. But it does not happen like that. Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate. I found in Rasmussen that 52% of voters oppose the proposed health care plan while 44% favor. As far as the 1/6 economy comment, just type that sentence in google and you will see lots of stats to prove it. I agree with Pro that what i have said is mostly rhetoric based on opinion. But this is the format of debate i would like have with someone. Statistical battles rarely get you anywhere. I would like to have a general discussion about how much government we want and how much individual responsiblity we want. Pro has a tactic to win a debate which consists of delegitimizing my argument but i am still waiting for someone to come up with some solid points that stand on its own to support the need for big government. Can anyone out there do this?', \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything never the less something as large as health care that makes up about 1/6 of the US economy. The polls have shown that the people don't believe so either but yet they still try to cram it down our throats. I would like to hear from some people who still have this blind faith in big government.\", \"My closing statement is that we have known for years the earth is not flat. It's like arguing that Barack Obama is Satan.\", 'I am so sorry for the forfeit and the lateness of this argument. I understand how pointless it can make a debate seem, however I really like this one. Thank you for the extension. To start with my opening argument, I will use your definition of \\'flat.\\' I agree that the surface is wide, however, it is far from smooth. Because our world is three dimensional, things clearly stick out of the ground, such as the house or apartment you live in[2]. The earth definitely does not have little thickness, either. In fact, it is more than 4,000 miles deep[1]! This would also mean mountains and earthquakes would be unable to form[7]. Your definition of flat does not fit the earth. However, it is a lot closer to being spherical. From satellite images, we see the earth as a circle{1}. We can also see different countries on the earth depending on the angle, while the circle does not change size{2}. That would bring us to the logical conclusion that it must instead be a sphere. Rebuttals: If we lived on the flat side of the earth\\'s circle, and not the curved edge, your explanation of the sun and moon\\'s rotation would not hold up. Instead of the sun appearing to rise one way and set the other, it would seem to appear already in the sky and slowly rotate in one direction. It would be the same way with the moon. They would ever cross the center of the earth without having no sun at all for the rest of the planet either, and would completely invalidate our system of time[3] and make day and night nonexistent. This model also causes problems with the rest of our solar system. We have proven that the planets rotate around the sun[4]. If the sun rotated around the earth instead, the other planets would not have the same days of their own[5]. \"Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick.\" That paragraph made little sense grammatically, but I think I understood the point. If I were zooming past earth at the speed of light, I of course would see nothing as our eyes can\\'t process things that fast[6]. If your idea for gravity were true, then the water in the oceans would be forced off the planet because it is not contained. Sources: [1] http://www.livescience.com...

One more definition: Earth: the planet on which we live; the world. From Google This should be fun, thank you for the challenge!', 'All points extended.', 'Okay so let\\'s get down to some crazy things for this wounderous debate. So to clarify I will be debating that the Earth is flat by using the Neo-Classical Model with the following descripition. The earth is finite disk. The earth is being accelerate upwards at approximately 9.80665 m/s2. The earth is the only known \"disk\" in the universe. The laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame. The speed of light, measured in any inertial reference frame, always has the same value, c. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) Contention 1: Rotation of sun and the seasons. One of the greatest questions you have right now is probably if the Earth is flat how does day and night work. Well the answer is actually that the Sun and the moon rotate around the Earth in a circular motion. As seen in the gif that I\\'ve provided above you can painly see that ti\\'s a spotlight type roation as it rotates around the Earth illuminating only a certain portion of the Earth at a time simulating both night and day. Here we can the if we were a photon that the Earth would shrink to ironically the same thickness that I have previously described. Here is a simulator that shows the exact same thing. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Seasons are explained above. As the Sun moves closer to the poles it becomes colder in the northern hemisphere while when the Sun is closer to the equatro it is actually summer time. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) If we use the above model we can see that the Earth is indeed the center of the Universe. Though the other planets may orbit the sun we can see that the sun and the rest of the solar system orbits around the Earth. Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick. Contention 2: Gravity Now before you jump to several statements that Gravity should collapse the Earth into a sphere there is just one problem with that. Gravity doesn\\'t exist. How in the world is this you may ask. Well you can see that the Earth is actually accelerating up at the acceration of 9.88 meters per second. This explains Newton\\'s gravitationial theory, but Newton was incorrect here. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) With the increased accerlation it becomes apparent that this also causes you to be shorter at the end of the day. Now to further this I would like to clarify that gravitation, not gravity exists. This explains the tides as stars and the moon/other celestial bodies all have slight gravitationial pull. Here is a list on how they are different in order to clarify the debate up a tad bit. - Gravity or the gravitational field is a vector field, while gravitational force is only a vector. - Gravity lies in the radial direction from the mass, while gravitational force is in the direction of the line connecting the two masses. - Gravitational field requires only one mass, while two masses are required for gravitational force. - Gravitational force is equal to the product of the mass of the test object and the gravitational field intensity. (http://www.differencebetween.com...) Now I want you to imagin living on this Earth, which as I showed earlier is just a flat disk. The gravitational force is actually angled to the point to where as you get further and further away from the center (the north pole) you can see that the increasing gravitationial force would cause you to want to fall back towards the center and not want to go towards the edge of the Earth. The people living away from the north pole would have their living conditions inclined in order to meet such a force. It would feel like you are trying to clime up a steeper and steeper hill. Contary to belief you wouldn\\'t fall off the edge due to the gravitationial vector pointing back towards the north pole, the actual fear would be falling off the edge and rolling back towards the center as shown in the picture above. That is all for my opening arguments and my rebuttles shall come in the next round as requested by my opponent.', \"This debate is impossible to accept.

I thank my opponent for his response, and look forward to the final round :) I ran out of characters in RD 1 for the proper thank yous and whatnot. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On instinct (clarification of my position): My opponent fundamentally misunderstands the argument I\\'m making in terms of instinct, especially in terms of stratification. We didn\\'t emulate the behavior of other animals—we are an animal, and animals all have the instinct to stratify. Stratification is a part of survival, as is socialization. My opponent also disregards all of my analysis that actually validates the stratification argument. Allow me to reiterate: 1. Stratification does not have to be negative. Animals other than human beings don\\'t tend to oppress. They simply establish an order, with survival-related duties, and are able to work cooperatively to achieve a desired end, which is the survival of the entire community. Stratification does not have to be a servant to self-love, as my opponent asserts. Greed and superiority are not the same as natural herd stratification. Don\\'t allow him to equate the two. 2. I never wanted us to disregard the teachings of men like Marx. In fact, I specifically stated in RD 1 that there are pieces of profound truth to communist theory that we should be integrating into our political and social realities. However, I still maintain that a society without any sort of stratification is an impossibility, simply because stratification is a survival tool utilized by all members of the animal kingdom. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On stratification and its characterization (important extension here): My opponent severely overestimates my conception of stratification. I don\\'t believe I was unclear prior, but if I was, I apologize. Capitalism, in and of itself, does not encourage any of the harms that my opponent or Marx accuse it of. In fact, as I stated in RD 1, all governments are liable to these shortcomings, as all governments are made of a mixed bag of people. Until humans are homogeneously altruistic, Communism can\\'t work. This is a key point that I want the voters to extend, as my opponent and Marx fail to take human differentiation into account. Capitalism operates within the realm of observed human behavior while giving humanity room to grow into more altruistic tendencies (as Capitalism uses these behaviors and instincts to benefit the entire community—see Adam Smith). Communism requires that all of its followers be uniformly virtuous from the beginning, which is purely unrealistic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On self-interest (my opponent\\'s same tag line): Self-love, as Adam Smith calls it, keeps the butcher being a butcher. My opponent has yet to clearly articulate how goods and services would be exchanged within a Communist system while not creating the stratification that I say is necessary to keep a society functioning at equilibrium. If the butcher can do something easier and still receive the same amount of goods or services in return, then the butcher will choose the easier profession. This is not a categorically true scenario, but it is highly realistic. While societies have made some misjudgments and mistakes regarding which professions deserve more merit than others, this is yet another moment where pieces of communist theory might temper the functioning of a Capitalist system. However, if I am to receive no merit for spending 10 years in medical school, racking up debts and killing myself for the benefit of society, why should I be a brain surgeon? Again, my opponent assumes that all people can or will be homogeneous in their altruism, which is simply untrue. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ On \"rotten apples\": My opponent is making categorical assertions about Capitalism based on some of its misapplication in the world. Not every capitalist society operates in this fashion. Capitalism is a spectrum of application, and this is just more evidence as to why Communism can\\'t work. Capitalism at least accounts for human differentiation and arms people with tools to fight back against the \"rotten apples.\" Since my opponent enjoys making generalizations about existing governments, I\\'ll make one in turn: all manifestations of Communism have degenerated into Socialism. Why? The reason is because the naivete of the theory makes it supremely simple to dupe an entire population into dictatorship. The fact that multiple forms of Capitalism have succeeded in the world while Communism has not, after multiple attempts, suggests that education cannot overcome all. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On proletariat revolution & oppressor vs. oppressed (key extension here): 1. Marx really does advocate the entire overthrow of the current social system. He says this directly in his manifesto. I can quote it if my opponent would like me to do so. 2. The French Revolution is precisely the sort of thing that Freire was talking about, so I\\'m not sure how my opponent, who is a student of Communist theory, can simply shrug off my comparison. While the French Revolution wasn\\'t ever meant to instill Communism, it is a direct, historical example of the oppressed becoming extreme oppressors. Rather than simply eliminating the current social order via the head of state, the middle & lower class uprising felt it necessary to murder thousands of nobles, as well, most of whom merely held a title higher than the revolutionaries\\'. Even Freire, a passionate Communist and Marxist, admits that this is an incredibly dangerous result of Proletariat uprisings. And the French Revolution isn\\'t the only time we\\'ve seen this result. Look to Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as much of South America. 3. While violence and the switching of superiority may contradict Communism\\'s ultimate goal, that doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t happen. My opponent entirely drops all arguments I make for the necessity of retribution within humanity\\'s schema of justice, which is huge to my advocacy. The reason the roles tend to switch is because of our need for retributive justice, which is another human trait seen unadulteratedly around the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In summation, my opponent has still not been able to prove that Communism, as Marx envisioned it, can actually exist for any amount of time. I remind voters that he must prove that human beings can be uniformly altruistic, and that human beings do not need natural stratification in order to survive. Also, I want to especially highlight the problems Communism has with retributive justice. Since my opponent did not address this, I encourage you to weigh this heavily in the round.', 'Communism, in theory, espouses noble ideals for humanity. It encourages, essentially, blind equality and shared resources, and discourages the stratification that seems to plague the planet\\'s human societies. However, though we may learn many tidbits of wisdom with which we may perfect human existence, a truly unadulterated Communist society we shall never see. While I normally would not write a case in this fashion, today\\'s arguments will be primarily in essay form, as my advocacy requires it. My apologies. My primary assertion today is that it is genetically and instinctually impossible to achieve a society in which stratification and self-interest are not a part of the political or ideological equation. Everything that humanity does may be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to its instincts. We are animals. We make the supreme & egotistical mistake time and time again of forgetting our membership in this kingdom of beasts. Yes, we have an ability to rationalize that extends far beyond our animal brethren, but we, like they, are still slaves to our genetic urges. The only difference is that we have more chance of overcoming some of them than other animals do. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We\\'ll start with stratification. Marx, in his manifesto, makes some very damning claims against the bourgeois class at the time, and blames Capitalism for a number of things: \"The bourgeoisie…has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \"natural superiors,\" and has left no other bond between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment.\" It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.\" (http://www.marxists.org...) Unfortunately for Marx, this is largely unwarranted, since feudal, monarchical, dictatorial, and even \"communist\" systems have exhibited the same evils as a society that is operated by a free market. Materialism, therefore, cannot be blamed for the cold calculations of the wealthy against everyone else. Stratification, light or severe, can be found in every society on the planet, without exception. Something so universal, and something that existed long before the concept of Capitalism, must be to blame. Stratification, therefore, is much more likely due to human nature, even if it is a \"misfiring\" upper class amongst a sea of altruism. Even in the most peaceful societies in existence, some sort of social hierarchy is present. Just as in the rest of the animal kingdom, a chain of being exists naturally amongst humans. We can be compared to packs, prides, or flocks. A social theory that seeks to break apart our natural understanding of the world will inevitably fail, because people will inevitably gravitate toward this hierarchy. Now, it does not compute that this hierarchy must be bad. This is, perhaps, where humanity could learn something from men like Marx & Freire. A readjustment of how we perceive the hierarchy would probably lead to a far more peaceful existence than the power struggles we witness today. However, that\\'s not what Communism wants. It wants a full restructuring in that it wants an elimination of social structure, which would go against every societal instinct within the human condition. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, onto self-interest. I do not want my opponent to mischaracterize self-interest negatively right off the bat as selfishness. The two are distinct in that self-interest has a clear instinctual foundation. Every animal in the animal kingdom is concerned with its own survival. Granted, instinctually, we are all also concerned on some level with helping our species thrive, as well. This would be the altruistic side of our genetics. But, self-interest is undeniable. While we, unlike other animals, have the unique ability to interpret, weigh out, and even deny some instincts, we won\\'t categorically do this. Hence, any political theory that seeks to paint the human animal as something that it cannot physically be will fail monumentally, as it cannot account for even the smallest variations from the concept of blind equality. Adam Smith, expositor of capitalist theory and moral philosopher, characterizes a positive system of societal order as one which uses the instinct of self-interest to the benefit of the society. He says, in Wealth of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.\" While this may seem callous, it is not. It is merely a metacognitive examination of rhetoric which speaks to instincts, and seeks to manipulate our natural desire for self-preservation in order to benefit society as a whole. Adam Smith, of course, did not categorically apply this to all of society\\'s transactions. This quotation, as I said before, is merely an examination of more extreme rationale. Though not every member of society provides goods and services in order to self-serve, it is the butcher, baker, or brewer that is overly concerned with self-interest that Communism has no place for, but that would exist in the world even if it weren\\'t for Capitalist theory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The gist of this analysis leads me to two final theoretical concerns regarding Communism: the tragedy of the commons and the oppressed turning oppressor. Tragedy of the commons, attributed to Garrett Hardin, claims that it only takes a handful of overly self-interested people to exploit the resources of a shared community, which then make it impossible for that community to survive. Hardin uses the example of a shared pasture for cattle grazing. A handful of farmers may agree to share this land, but if 1 of those farmers sneaks out into the middle of the night to graze his herd more out of self-interest, it will cost the community severely. Let\\'s pretend, for a moment, that self-interest is merely a fluke, an anomaly in the genetic world. Statistically, those who abuse others due to self-interest will find their way into these Communistic communities. After all, self-interest would compel you to reside with such altruistic people, for they are the easiest to exploit. Secondly, Paulo Freire describes the problem of the relationship between the oppressed and the oppressor. Quite readily, self-interest manifested turns to vengeful and retributive behavior. When a people has suffered to such a great extent, the psychological need for justice, for what is equitable, will make equilibrium nearly impossible to achieve. This need for retribution expresses itself in every justice system in the world, though some are more severe than others. The US and other first world nations have tempered retribution with a delicate and convoluted system of proportionality. In places like Rwanda, retribution is manifested in genocide. Either way, the oppressed, the victim, will generally require some sort of psychological or philosophical satisfaction that moves beyond simply removing power from an oppressor. The need for penalty or punishment is another universal human interest that my opponent will need to deal with on a biological level in order to convince us that Communism will succeed.', \"I appreciate my opponent's candor in RD 3, and hope to debate him again many times in the future. Enjoy the first 2 rounds, voters!\", 'My opponent asserts that Marx\\'s criticism and damning of the system is very specifically aimed at Capitalism. This, slightly, draws attention from the main point of Marx\\'s goal, and that is the elimination of the social conditionining of a need for a tangible reward for a service. This conditioning is seen in all systems of government my opponent has listed: traders in village markets in a Feudalistic society, etc. My opponent also claims that humans will naturally form hierarchies because we are animals; and since the rest of the animal kingdom does so, we, naturally, should as well. It is true that we are animals, only more rational and cognitive. Though, this does not mean that we should be inclined to form hierarchies to satisfy our apparent \\'instinct\\'. Though, to first address a big issue; is it an instinct? Or is it, just as greed is, a behavior learned from our environment? Humans, since the beginning of time, have used nature as a reference and resource to how to live and operate. Is it possible that somewhere along our timeline of social evolution, we observed the process of stratification in the Animal Kingdom and emulated the behavior? It wouldn\\'t be the first time this would happen. Many \\'human\\' behaviors and inventions have been inspired by nature: Business, Farming, Medicine, etc. In resolution, we, as humans, should use our gift of logic and reason, and be able to willfully transcend any inherent, or learned need to set others either superior or inferior. There is no excuse that someone can surmount to contradict this; except a personal testimony of their physical and mental inability to willfully overcome any tendency to need to be socially and monetarily rewarded greater than another, only because society has perceived their profession as more \\'important\\'. Is it so hard to restrain one\\'s self from needing a controlled currency, and to contribute to society with their ability and be given necessities? A misconception is that this will prevent people from attaining possessions that they want; this is simply untrue. Marx\\'s quote \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" doesn\\'t merely mean that you are only given your bare necessities and left at that. The quote is only a way for people to see anew, a type of life that would be truly altruistic. The only way for this type of civlilization to actually happen, is for people to learn; and this is done through the long and enduring, but rewarding, process of education. Not fascist, brainwashing education, as seen 1984, but true, non-regimented, open-minded education. ---------------- Now to address my opponent\\'s argument for self-interest. It is true that self-interest is not entirely selfish, as it is how we survive, and does not always lead to the misery of others to sustain our prosperity. But, where exactly does self interest exclude itself from a Communistic society? Look at it from this perspective. The butcher is good at his/her job and wishes to provide to society in the only way that he/she can, effectively. But, the butcher also wants to be able to have a home and the necessities, and pleasures, in life. Through self interest (as mentioned before, not selfishness), the butcher continues to do his/her job in order to be a positive member of the community, because they understand that if they do what they are skilled at doing, they will receive the desired necessities and simple pleasures of life. Self-interest needs not to be completely abolished in a Communistic society. In regards to the issue of the few rotten apples spoiling the bunch. .. Denying that there would be a presence of people unwilling to adapt to the philosophies in a Communistic society, would be ignorant. But as I said before when speaking about the issue of the learned behavior to stratify; education trumps all problems; maybe not completely, as perfection is impossible. But the waning of the greed ridden mindset that would trouble a Communistic society, wouldn\\'t be out of the question. Now, I\\'m NOT advocating that any persons not wishing to \\'assimilate\\' to this livelihood of the new society be discriminated against, or singled out for immediate attention (similar to what America has done with \\'failures\\' in the IQ system haha) and be \\'fixed\\', mentally. I\\'m only saying, that education, throughout a person\\'s life, would allow them the chance to understand that the old mindset of \"I work, and I receive the payment accredited, even if it is more than another\\'s\" is unnecessary and leads to nothing but conflict. My opponent then asserts that in the event that a Proletarian revolution occurs, the Proletariat will want blood in exchange for the oppression that they suffered at the hands of the Bourgeoisie. Although this has been seen many times in history whenever a major anarchical event has happened, this would not be the French Revolution. Although Marx did predict that some, if not most, of the worker\\'s revolutions would involve violence; he predicted this not for the reason of the worker\\'s hate for the Bourgeoisie, but, possibly, as a necessary measure to break free from the chains instituted by the elite class. Now, I may have initiated a mindset of \"He\\'s an anarchist and wants to overthrow everything! etc. . \"; but this is not my goal. I unequivocally believe that, like Dr. King\\'s peaceful civil rights movement, we can achieve an extreme change in our society, without violence and turmoil (By the Proletariat, the same cannot be said for the challenged Bourgeoisie). If a violent, vindictive revolution were to occur, it would be the antithesis of the entire point of a Marxist revolution; the point of which, is the equalization of all. Wouldn\\'t it be a complete and utter contradiction of the belief to punish others for their past \\'deeds\\', therefore placing them below those involved with the revolution, merely switching the roles of superiority, hence contradicting the main philosophy of the revolution? \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" - Karl Marx', 'The idea of Communism in this debate, is a society in which Bourgeoisie and Proletariat no longer exist, and only people, no longer identified through monetary or social value, are left. The idea of government (Government defined as a selective ruling body that decides how people should live; no matter how involved the citizens, it is defined as this) has been abolished. People dictate their own lives.', \"I misjudged how much I could handle, and spent too much time on one debate. And so, as a result, I will have to forfeit this debate, as well as another one in the process as well. Hopefully in the next few days, when I'm less busy, we can re open this debate, or even change sides for fun :D Please vote for my opponent, as I haven't been able to fully articulate my argument. , and she has put a lot of effort into this debate, and deserves the win. Thank you :D\", 'When Tommy took on the Gatlin boys, it is true that he could not undo the rape, nor could he instill guilt in people of such a brutish nature. However, he did show much more than the fact that he has the ability to punch people. He showed that he would no longer allow himself to be pushed around. That one act and the statement made by it could\\'ve quite possibly turned Tommy\\'s life around for the better. In this case and many others, the saying \"Action speaks louder than words\" is applicable. In my previous arguments, I have possibly been misconstrued. The fact that most wars were unnecessary does not indicate a concession on my part. I clearly stated in Round 1 \"Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them.\" My stance is not \"that all war is good for something.\" Rather, my stance is that war is good for MORE than absolutely nothing. There is a difference between these two views. Now when it comes to my examples of people fighting for their own self-defense, their dignity, and their honor, you ask \"What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive.\" But cannot the same things be said of the morals and compassion you mention? These too can be viewed as \"made up human concepts.\" If concepts such as these render an argument invalid, then your arguments stand to lose just as much validity as mine. You also claim that \"Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself.\" But when that self is multiplied by a large number, as was the case in Scotland, then a large section of humanity has been helped. In the section on intelligence, you say that people can still see that life is better than death. Even this may be debatable given some of the stupidity I\\'ve witnessed. Nevertheless, this is not what needs to be understood. The issue is whether or not the majority of people have the ability to see someone else\\'s perspective on a situation. Many people do not have this ability, and I do not believe that an unintelligent leader would either. George W. Bush is a leader that barely has the intelligence to comprehend a coloring book. Does it seem like he can understand the viewpoints of others? Mentioning the budget for the War on Terror can only speak against that war and others similar to it. It cannot serve to counter the rationale behind the wars I mentioned, which took place long before such budgets were associated with the act of war. (Note: I did check off that I\\'m in favor of The War on Terror in my profile, but this does not mean I agree with any of the budgets, policies, or methods used.) When it comes to the points on ignorance, you seem to think education can enlighten everyone. This is sadly not the case. I have been in countless classes where people would simply not understand a concept no matter how often it was repeated or how many times it was explained. Teaching acceptance of others also would not work. Oftentimes two opposing viewpoints are irreconcilable. If this were not the case, a site such as this could not exist. On your other point, I do realize that if both sides stop violence, then my self-defense reasoning does not apply. The problem is that even this is not as simple as it seems. You state \"Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end.\" But the dynamics involved in the beginnings of a war are rarely so cut and dry. What Riley from the Boondocks needs to understand is that there are situations in which neither side realizes that anything is starting until it is too late. Look at the current situation in the U.S. Rights are being taken away, but both the government and the majority of the citizens feel that it is justified. If and when the situation turns ugly, which side will it be that \"started\" something? The chain of events that can lead to war is highly complex, dependent upon many factors, and very dynamic. It is not one side slapping and the other defending. That is just a gross simplification. I have shown examples where war can be used as self-defense. But it may have another use. Namely, keeping the human population in check. For every species, there is a population limit. In biology this is known as the carrying capacity and is symbolized by the letter \"k.\" The current population is roughly 6.5 billion! What would it be without wars? It is possible that we would\\'ve reached the carrying capacity, and at that point mass deaths would\\'ve occurred. These totals would\\'ve been higher than the amount seen in war. Theoretically, most of the population is wiped out. So wars are good for both population control and self-defense. Having both of these uses, they can definitely been seen as good for more than absolutely nothing. To Darth_Grievous_42: I too thought this was a good debate. You presented some excellent arguments that kept me on my toes. And to satisfy your curiosity, my picture is the cover of the Pink Floyd album Meddle.', 'Coward Of The County by Kenny Rogers Everyone considered him the coward of the county. He\\'d never stood one single time to prove the county wrong. His mama named him Tommy, the folks just called him yellow, But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison. I looked after Tommy \\'cause he was my brothers son. I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy: \"Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun. Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.\" Theres someone for everyone and Tommy\\'s love was Becky. In her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man. One day while he was workin the Gatlin boys came callin. They took turns at Becky.... there was three of them! Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy\\'s picture. As his tears fell on his daddys face, he heard these words again: Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom. One of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor. When Tommy turned around they said, \"Hey look! old yeller\\'s leavin.\" But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door. Twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him. He wasn\\'t holdin nothin back; he let \\'em have it all. When Tommy left the barroom not a Gatlin boy was standin. He said, \"This one\\'s for Becky,\" as he watched the last one fall. And I heard him say, I promised you, dad, not to do the things you\\'d done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please dont think Im weak, I didnt turn the other cheek, And papa, I sure hope you understand: Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man. Everyone considered him the coward of the county. Although this applies only to one individual, many of the conflicts previously mentioned could be analagous. After all, what was the conflict in Scotland during the late 13th and early 14th centuries if not a case of the Gatlin boys picking on someone? The only difference is that there were larger numbers on both sides. Even the rape of Becky took place in the form of prima nocte. I have read through your arguments, and I suppose the main problem I have with them is your over-optimistic viewpoints. Of course if there are two viable options: one being war and the other being a logical discussion to work out the differences, the discussion is to be preferred. The problem is that there are many people that do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss things or to bother to try and understand an opposing viewpoint. When you state \"Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past\" I must ask what the \\'us\\' refers to. If it refers to you and I, then you are correct. But if it refers to the human population in general, I beg to differ. Despite the many claims you may hear about humans being a superior species, I can assure you that most humans are actually quite lacking in intelligence. Not only are there many that cannot see the mistakes of the past, they will almost certainly repeat those same mistakes in the future. You say \"All the examples you have stated so far are all situations [where] reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine.\" Is this really true? Do you really believe that the Scots could\\'ve said \"Hey wait! Let\\'s talk this out nicely.\"? Even if they could, would you want to resolve the issue with a nice discussion after somebody had just raped your wife? Of course they would claim that it was a legal right, but this it is still unacceptable. As the penultimate line of Coward of the County states: \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man.\" My main point is that reason and understanding cannot be implanted into the minds of others. When you state \"The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory\" you are absolutely correct. They shouldn\\'t have done these things. The problem is they did. If a child decides to stick up for himself and hit a bully back after the bully starts with him, the child that fought back cannot be condemned. Of course anyone can still make the correct statement \"The bully should\\'ve never started with him in the first place.\" This is true, but it is what bullies do. Similarly, when the British invade Zulu territory, the Zulus cannot be condemned for starting the Anglo-Zulu war. Did the war have to be fought? No. But that doesn\\'t make it wrong. The child could\\'ve let the bully pick on him and avoid a fight as well. But letting issues get resolved through such passive action is not good. People should have the right to defend themselves. You claim \"Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death.\" This is not the case. There are a great many people in this world that will not be affected by words. They either won\\'t care or they won\\'t have the intelligence to understand them. I know this may seem like an extremely uncivilized and savage claim, but bullets, missiles and bombs are the only reasoning that many of these brutes will understand. As unsophisticated as this may sound, it is sadly the truth. I don\\'t have the space to reiterate all of the lyrics to War and go through them all once more, but there are a few other points I\\'d like to make concerning some of them. \"Who wants to die?\" You claim that it is only an escape for a temporary situation. But an excellent point is made in the movie V for Vendetta. When the character V tortures Natalie Portman he shows her that death is actually not the worst thing. There are some principles that exist that are worth dying for. This ultimate realization came to her, as it did to V at the end of the movie. He knew that he would die on that final night, and yet that paled in comparison to his goal of changing the corrupt government and giving hope to the other citizens. You ask \"Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice?\" Perhaps if they could, but this is an impossibility. The point of many of these sacrifices is that the principle was worth more than life. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" To this you state \"Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past.\" Now this may be true, but not realistic. Brains cannot be instilled in those that are not learned. Your view is extremely optimistic, but in reality a leopard cannot fully change its spots. Those without brains will never become intellectual. And when these unintellectual brutes start trouble, no amount of compassion or brain can persuade them. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" You say to me \"You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy.\" Once again, the intelligence needed to reach a conclusion through diplomacy is not present. It would\\'ve been better, but it simply cannot happen. You also say in reference to this \"The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step?\" I\\'ll tell you why they couldn\\'t skip a step. It is not that it was physically impossible. It is that it was impossible in terms of the mental capacity required for such acts. I have no space left, but my main point is that your optimistic views are not realistic.', 'This is a very original and highly amusing means of presenting an argument. I commend you on your creativity. I will first begin by showing that war may sometimes be necessary. From there I will use examples to show that it is good for more than absolutely nothing. After the basis of my argument has been laid out, I can address all of the points in the song lyrics. Although war is often construed as a means of destruction, it can in many cases be a means of liberation. A brief look at history can show examples where war served as the only means of obtaining freedom. Take Scotland in the late 13th and early 14th centuries for example. The Scots were constantly being tyrannized by the British and were subjected to many injustices. Although the movie Braveheart dramatized and perhaps exaggerated some of the details, atrocities such as prima nocte really did occur. Another example can be seen in the Anglo-Zulu war. The British invaded the territory of the Zulus, and the Zulus decided to go to war and die rather than allow others to take over their land. This may seem pointless to you, but many would consider it brave and noble. The Zulus with primitive weapons actually defeated the British in the Battle of Isandlwana, and although many died, they died nobly. I know that in the end the Zulus lost the war, but this does not mean that people should allow invaders to take over without consequence. One more example to mention is the French Revolution. Things were so bad with unemployment, malnutrition, and even famine that people literally had to fight for their lives. Death was going to come anyway. Should it come by means of slow and torturous starvation, or should it come through a revolution that could possibly pave the road for change? In cases such as these, war can be seen as a means of self-defense. Now to address the points highlighted in the song. \"Because it means destruction Of innocent lives\" In the cases I mentioned, many innocent lives were already being destroyed. Even in cases where death is not the means of destruction, the constant tyrannical oppressions that make life unbearable can be viewed as a way of sucking the life out of innocent people. When such is the case, rising up to fight for self-preservation becomes more noble than allowing the injustices to continue. \"War means tears To thousands of mothers eyes When their sons go to fight And lose their lives\" I have no doubt that this is true. But when tears are welling up in the eyes of not only mothers, but entire populations yearning for justice, then the tears shed for those who died fighting the good fight pale in comparison. \"War, it ain\\'t nothing But a heartbreaker\" For oppressed populations, war can actually be heartlifting rather than heartbreaking. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" It is also a friend to those who have been freed by it. In fact, even corrupt coalitions that start wars to take over land may still view war as their friend if they come out victorious. They may not be good people, but it still serves to show that war is not friend ONLY to the undertaker. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" See the previous rebuttal. Not all mankind views war as an enemy. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them. There can be a very good point to starting a war. Allowing others to steamroll over you cannot be considered a valid alternative to war. \"War has caused unrest Within the younger generation\" War has done more than this. It has very likely caused unrest with people of every generation. But this cannot be used to condemn the wars previously mentioned. These people were already in a state of unrest. \"Induction then destruction\" The destruction point was previously addressed. Being inducted into a war and then destroyed is probably better than sitting and waiting for destruction to come. \"Who wants to die?\" Those with extreme suffering often choose death as a means of escape. When it comes to the oppressed, a voluntary death may be better than a life of suffering. \"Ooooh, war, has shattered Many a young mans dreams Made him disabled, bitter and mean\" I cannot contend that war has left many people disabled. This is a sad tragedy. But the bitterness is probably much more present when the disabled view the war as pointless. Many (perhaps most) wars are pointless...but not all. \"Life is much to short and precious To spend fighting wars these days\" The words \\'these days\\' seem to refer to the present. I must say that in the present day I have often felt that we may actually have to fight another revolutionary war within our own country. Atrocities such as the Patriot Act are taking away the very freedoms that made this country so great. And as the grip gets tighter and tighter, it may only be a matter of time before both you and I must choose whether to live under a dictatorship or rise up and fight. \"War can\\'t give life It can only take it away\" Is this really true? Cannot it not be said that the Treaty of Edinburgh (the end result of the conflict between Scotland and Britain) gave life to the subsequent generations of Scotland? In the French Revolution, war gave life to some who would\\'ve died of famine. \"Peace, love and understanding Tell me, is there no place for them today?\" There certainly should be a place for them. But it is impossible to have all people of all nations on the same wavelength. Consequently, many people that only wish for peace can sometimes find themselves in a situation where war becomes the lesser evil. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom But Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" I\\'ve been arguing a similar point. If there is a Lord that does know a better way, he certainly hasn\\'t informed anyone of what this is. In fact, there are many biblical accounts in which the Lord supposedly helped one side defeat another in battle. So even for those that choose to believe in some omnipotent force, a better way has yet to be revealed. My main point is that war is good for more than absolutely nothing. It is good for obtaining freedom from all types of oppression and invasion. It may even have further uses that I will explore in later rounds.', 'Ah, you found a rebuttal song. Very nice. Well, what exactly was it that Tommy achieved by beating up the Gatlin boys? Did he take the rape back magically? Did the boys feel bad about what they did? Did he prove he was a man? No, he accomplished none of these things, all he did was show he could punch people. That\\'s about it. After reading your last round it seems you completely agree with me that war should be avoided. So then you concede this debate? Your stance is that all war is good for something. But in this last round you\\'ve taken the stance that \"war should be avoided, but it just won\\'t\". I cannot deny that what was done in the past was done and served a purpose. I can\\'t deny that wars will continue to happen due to lack of human intelligence. But that is not the case I am making. I am saying it could have and should have never happened in the first place. There is potential for us all to come to terms peacefully, and while there is that possibility there is reality. My views are optimistically realistic. I can see the better parts of man and know that we can do it. So none of my claims are preposterous, just highly unlikely. As far as they can apply to the real world I know that they will probably never come into action in the real world. But again, this is not my stance. My stance is about what should and could happen. That is what War is singing about. He is not saying war will never happen, he\\'s jus saying they shouldn\\'t. On this point it seems you agree with me, thus making my stance victorious. But now to discuss your point that they have no ability to ever stop. In summary, it seems your concerns are: Honor, intelligence, ignorance and one sided-ness. Honor: In concerns to the Scot and Tommy. What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive. Honor is a made up human concept, and can easily be restored with counseling. The only judge on honor is yourself, no one and nothing else\\'s. So, is fighting a war based on rape a good idea? Does it make the war just? No, it does not. It would still have been better for the Scots to have engaged in a peaceful negotiation. It would have been better for Tommy to call on the cops and let them suffer in a concrete room. The only accomplishment they made was gaining revenge, another self induced concept. Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself. So this is not a good reason to continue fighting wars. SO your lyric should not read \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man\", but rather \\'Sometimes you wanna fight when your a man\\'. Intelligence: You claim that people, both now and then, do not have the mental capacity to settle things peacefully. This is half-true, I can\\'t deny that. Never the less, they still have some modicum of intelligence to see that life is better than death. So even in the most unintelligent leader, they still have the ability, just not the will. It is still not an excuse, only an observation. But we all do have the ability to raise the intelligence of man kind, low as it is today. The budget on the War on Terror currently is in the trillions. Do you have any idea how many new schools could be constructed with that financing. I\\'m not talking about a lot of little \\'podunk\\' badly constructed schools. This kind of money could build thousands of university level institutions. It could re-furnish every American school twice over with new books, new desks, new computers, new everything with cash to spare. Yet it all goes to bullets, bombs, missiles and the things that fire them. All of these are good to only use a few times, but a school can last generations. So intelligence is not totally out of the question. Yes, right now human brain poser is less than satisfactory. True, the mental states of people in the past were less than a modern middle schooler. Yet we in the here and now have the ability to stop further destruction. We can teach those who will live beyond us the folly\\'s of the past, and make war nothing more than a definition in a text book they will read. So low intelligence is not an excuse either, only an obstacle. Ignorance: True, there are some people who will not change their blood thirsty ideals until they\\'ve been released of their own mortal coil. But that can all be solved with education, as stated above. People only know as much as they are taught. Right now, people are being taught to distrust their fellow man. They learn that they \\'other side\\' only wants you dead, and that you need to wan them dead more to stay alive. People just need to start teaching acceptance of \\'the enemy\\', because once your enemy is your friend, you have no enemies to fight against. Because this can also be avoided, this is also not a reason why wars should be fought. One sided-ness: A misconception you seem to have is that only one side should turn the other cheek while the other will continue to slap. This is not what I am saying. Both sides need to stop the violence, and can. War is a double edged sword. You cannot just sheath one side for it to no longer be a threat. Both sides must go into sheath. Both sides have the capabilities to stop war, thus both are accountable. Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end. Both sides need to stop war before it happens. As Riley of the Boondocks once said: If you don\\'t start nothing, there won\\'t be nothing. The same is true when it comes to war. In V for Vendetta, the British Government shouldn\\'t have take the peoples rights, and Evy wouldn\\'t have needed to be tortured by V because V would have nothing to fight against. My stance is that wars are good for absolutely nothing. I have proved that to be true. We can avoid war. Because we can we should. Continuing to do so just idiotic. There is no dispute that can only be settled with violence, people only think it is. Every obstacle can be overcome with learning, with understanding, with compassion. It is not mere optimism that fuels what I say, its the examination of other, more profitable routes we can take. My stance isn\\'t just a sermon, it is a presentation of possibilities and facts. Basically a science. There is as much realism to my points as there was for the idea\\'s of flight and electricity. Right now, war is equivalent to the ideas that the only manner\\'s of transportation will ever be horse drawn buggies and that candle light is the only way to see in the dark. The only difference, and I do mean the only, is that instead of one man making this brilliant proposition and then the world accepts it is that everyone in the world must be apart of the proposition and accept it. War is a global disease, and must be handled on a global level. Undeniably war has happened. Undeniably it has had some positive effects. But in every case it did not need to be settled by war and could have been solved with non-deadly words. Thus war has never accomplished anything that couldn\\'t have been done some other way. Therefore they are good for absolutely nothing. To GaryBacon: Good debate. You\\'ve challenged me with your historical knowledge. I\\'m also impressed with your V for Vendetta analogy. Also, out of curiosity, what is your picture of? I\\'ve been trying to figure that out for some time now. To the audience: I\\'ll remind you that your voting is not determined by what stance you prefer but which side proved theirs better, be it mine or GaryBacon\\'s. If you feel the need to justify your anonymous vote you can do so in the comments area. Darth_Grievous_42 out.', 'Well thank you for that compliment. I must agree with Logical-Master, and I too would have been quite amused if you had found a rebuttal song. But back on subject. On Necessity: While I cannot refute that wars have served a purpose, I have to disagree that that makes them necessary. What happened to politics? Is it always necessary to result to fisticuffs when you don\\'t get your way? Is there no way that talking it through could not have solved anything? You might say no but I say yes. What you will say is that nothing would have been accomplished. The French would still be poverty. Scots would never have had freedom. Zulus would have lost their land. That is, of course, assuming both sides had engaged in combat. Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past. The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory. We can see it now, why couldn\\'t they? Did it really take all those lives, all the wounds, all the nightmares to figure that out? The truth is they could have without war, but were blinded by the manipulations of their past. The common law was if you needed something take it, by any means necessary. Everybody viewed everybody as an enemy, as something less than themselves, as different. But really, are we different at all? Did the Zulu\\'s not have 5 fingers on their hands like the British? Didn\\'t the British have two legs like the Zulu\\'s? Didn\\'t both sides of the French have kidneys, Livers, Lower Intestine, Bladders, Femurs, Molars, Eyebrows, Rib cages, etc? Was there no possible way that neither side could see that? Why neither could treat the other as friend rather than foe? All the examples you have stated so far are all situations were reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine. Its wasn\\'t self defence, it was close minded fear. People wanted results fast, not results right. Either way it could have reached the same outcome. So again, what was the use of war? \"Because it means destruction of innocent lives\" You claim that people have to fight to better there lives. Well, as I just pointed out, all it would take is reason and even the strife could have been avoided. The poor conditions of the people were caused by ignorance, and selfishness of those in power. With enough political involvement, these tyrants could have been userbed without deadly force. With a bit of consciousness, peoples lives could be better. Again, human stupidity stalls that. So another case were it could have been avoided, but rather than efficiency, people wanted speed and money. So these lives were still lost needlessly. \"War means tears to thousands of mothers eyes when their sons go to fight and lose their lives\" Can there really be any good fight? Its not just one mother, its thousands, even millions, and not just those on the \"good\" side but on the other as well (a good exemplification of this is the film \\'All Quiet on the Western Front\\') To both sides, their \\'good\\' fight is the bad one for the opposition. Many don\\'t even know why they are fighting, they just are. Especially when a draft comes into effect, and people who would rather not fight, die for a cause they didn\\'t support or did not want to get involved in. Do you still think \\'the good fight\\' would matter to those mothers? \"War, it ain\\'t nothing but a heart breaker\" War is still a heart breaker, even to the oppressed. No sane person smiles when they hear of a loved ones death on the battlefield, even if it was for a cause. A cause which could be solved with diplomacy. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" Couldn\\'t those corrupt coalitionists be seen as undertakers? Profiting off the dead? I believe War meant \\'undertaker\\' as general statement. But there is no doubt that war must be a happy time for funeral businesses. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" Incorrect. All mankind view war as an enemy. What people like is the \\'reasons\\' behind the wars. War is an enemy to the human race. It\\'s purposeful self destruction of our species, aka, murder. We are legally endorsing the job that we condemn people like Charles Mason and Timothy McVeigh for doing. A B52 pilot can easily beat the damage done in the Oklahoma City Bombing. A Marine can kill ten times more than Charles Mason. Why is it that no one else seems to see that war=murder. That is War is saying. We are killing ourselves. Reasons be damned. Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death. Without the reasoning its still murder. And because the reasoning can be resolved some other way. So we are killing ourselves needlessly! War is an enemy to everyone, no matter what story you tell yourself to sleep at night. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Give me a good reason to start a war. This means that reason could not, in any way, be resolved peacefully. There would have to be a good, legitimate reason that would progress mankind. There cannot be any ill will, or vengeful motivation behind it. All of these are in direct conflict with what war really is. But if you can find me 1 \\'good\\' war I will concede this point. I would suggest trying to find a few, as I\\'m sure I will be able to knock them down easily. \"War has caused unrest within the younger generation\" War messes everybody up. The father of a son dies. The sun wells up hatred. That son becomes a world leader, and declares war. That war kills another dad, with another son, and the cycle continues. War only fuels distrust, hatred, and revenge. It hinders progress because it scars people, physically, mentally and emotionally. The only reason its still alive is because we keep it alive, and say it\\'s right. Patriotism is just a nice sound way of saying \"I will kill anyone for this dirt\". Allegiance and loyalty are just the politically correct term of saying \"I don\\'t trust my fellow man\". War is bad, and always will be. \"Induction then destruction\" Destruction is always bad. It means death. Many people view death as being a bad thing. Again, diplomacy can spare us all the trouble. \"Who wants to die?\" An escape for a temporary situation. Nothing that can\\'t be solved with reason. In fact, many survivors of suicide come to that same realization. Life is precious, why stop it prematurely? I\\'m sure if we could talk to those dead in wars they would say the exact same thing. Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice? \"Ooooh, war, has shattered many a young mans dreams, made him disabled, bitter and mean\" So you concede to this point for the most part. Every surviving soldier I have met from a war is haunted with bad dreams and memories. Those with disabilities are loathsome of the cause. They lost their hand because two leaders could not shake theirs. Truly a waste. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past. If we do fight any in the future (undoubtedly we will) it will only be because we still haven\\'t realized this fact. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" The opposite of war isn\\'t peace, it\\'s creation. Wars destroy, people create. You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy. The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step? \"Peace, love and understanding tell me, is there no place for them today?\" But war is still evil, yes? What would be so wrong about getting people to understand each other? It would take time, perhaps some harsh words here and there, but any positive result that doesn\\'t require a gun is worth looking into. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom but Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" Diplomacy. Education. Reason. Understanding. LOVE. Just a thought. 22 Characters left.', 'As Pro, I am going to be defending that war (the fighting killing kind) is good for absolutly nothing.

Not through intimidation and violence.... This then dismisses the next argument about contradiction and arbitrary exemption since law enforcement doesnt come from violence and intimidation. \" if you move past a claimed boundary on the earth, the corporation claims the \"right\" to use the above-mentioned violence and intimidation in the pursuit of its goals.\"You are allowed to move beyond boundaries between governments though, they are called passports and it happens all the time. \"We can also not call being born into a geographical area as \"consent\" or acceptance of the legitimacy of that claim any more than being born into slavery is consent to being a slave.\"But if you dont like your country youre allowed to leave it. You cannot legally leave slaveryPeople dont voluntarily pay taxes but people do understand that the government has the right to collect taxes and use those taxes to pay for services to help the people. So taxes may be involuntary, but they are a necessary evil because people know that without taxes the government wouldnt function. \"The core difference between \\'government\\' corporations and other corporations is the idea that these claims are somehow \"legitimate\", ie, that other corporations can not do these things without being in violation of the law, but institutions which are perceived as \\'legitimate\", or labeled as \"government\", can do these things without being in violation of the law.\"If government corporations mess up they are liable to laws though, they most certainly are not immune. There are laws to regulate government agencies to keep their power in check at a certain amount or laws to maintain how ethical their actions are. Governments uphold laws in ways such that the unalienable rights of people are not violated and government corporations that do break laws are liable to penalties because the government is not all powerful and immune. That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass, they do not use intimidation and violence as law enforcement, and because things such as taxes are involuntary but are accepted as necessary evils by people. Now then here are a list of governments that are not criminal organizations. The Monarchy in NarniaThe government of Panem (Hunger Games)The Ministry of Magic (Harry Potter)The Volturi (Twilight)The government of Danistann (Nationstates.org)Those governments are not criminal organizations because even though they create laws and enforce them, have rights over a region, and collect taxes, they are fictional governments and thus are not criminal organizations even though they count as governments.', 'I will be doing this by justifying what it is governments are actually meant to do and give examples of governments that are 100% NOT criminal organizations as defined by the Pro.', 'Pros comparisons of governments and the Mafia - Ability to make laws - \" mob boss\\'s rules are the rules and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the mafia\\'s. \" But people dont recognize the Mafia Boss as the legitimate law maker of their land, people on the other hand do recognize governments as legit law makers, meaning that governments are not criminal organizations since they are legally recognized by the people as the lawmakers. - Rights given to people - \"Neither do governments. When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\"\"Ok then allow me to rephrase. Governments establish that it cannot violate the rights of people. The Mafia does not do that. Therefore a government is not a criminal organization since it establishes that a persons rights cannot be violated. - Consequences for violating laws - \" If you give it to me and I don\\'t shoot you, is it then OK? \"Youve made the correct choice in that scenario, however as stated above, the Government can only give you choices for punishment that do not violate a persons established right, the Mafia doesnt do that. Therefore a government is not a criminal organization since it can only give punishments that do not infringe on a persons rights. - Crossing state lines - \"the mob can kick you out of the ciy is if you\\'re a trouble-maker\"But as established before, the mafia isnt the recognized authority of the land and are not the official lawmakers of the land.

A government cannot use extreme measures of force because peoples rights defend from that, however to criminal organizations rights dont mean anything and there is an unlimited range of force they can use. Therefore Governments are not criminal organizations since the range of force a government can use against its people through law enforcement is limited, whereas for criminal organizations, it is not. - Legitimacy to collect taxes - \"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money\"Once again, people dont recognize the mafia as the legal entity that can collect taxes, the government though is. Therefore governments arent criminal organizations since people recognize governments to have the power to collect taxes legally, but criminal organizations do not. ========================================================================================================================================================Governments vs Anarchies - Governments give people rights - \"Rights are \"unalienable\".

For ALL governments to be criminal organizations you must prove that all governments are criminal organizations.

To the extent that they are fictional, their crimes are fictional, but that doesn\\'t change the fact that they are criminal. \"Im not talking about fictional crime families, im talking about fictional governments.

Pro is a die hard anarchist who probably believes that making your kid go to school counts as child abuse and absolutely refuses to acknowledge anything good the government has ever done. I am arguing that since governments provide services to people, give rights to people, protect and acknowledge people\\'s rights, repeal laws that are found to be unjust, give rights to people even when they are criminals, and passes laws that benefit people when they do not benefit the government. Governments are not criminal organizations, and by extension just because one government crosses the line one time that certainly does not mean that all governments are somehow all criminal organizations because the Pro has still yet to offer evidence of just how each and every last government is a criminal organization. Fictional or not', 'I will be using the term \"corporation\" to refer to organizations and institutions which may or may not meet the criteria of \"government\", as the term \"corporation\" literally means a \"body of people\". This can include any type of corporation - municipalities, nation-states, for-profit, non-profit, state-chartered, etc... (ie, all governments are corporations, but not all corporations are governments). This is to more easily compare institutions which do not meet the definitions above, and to clearly demonstrate the myth of legitimacy, and the problem with arbitrary exemptions. Also, If you have an example of a corporation which meets the criteria provided, please provide these examples in the early rounds, so that I may address them. At the very least, I would request that no examples be provided in the last round, as that would not leave me the opportunity to address anything I find to be incorrect.Please do not confuse \"society\" with \"government\". Before I begin, I would like to state that I accept the necessity of society, community, and of many of the services that these corporations labeled as \"government\" provide. If a corporation issues a \"law\", it is making a rule and promoting the obedience of that rule with \"law enforcement\" (both attributes are listed in the definition of government that we have accepted for this debate). Law enforcement is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of the goal of obedience. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:The use of violence an intimidation, without arbitrary exemptions, is the core principle behind criminal law. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression.If a corporation claims a \"monopoly right over a geographic area\", it is claiming that, on some level, it \"owns\" the land, and, if you move past a claimed boundary on the earth, the corporation claims the \"right\" to use the above-mentioned violence and intimidation in the pursuit of its goals. We can also not call being born into a geographical area as \"consent\" or acceptance of the legitimacy of that claim any more than being born into slavery is consent to being a slave.The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:Claiming a monopoly right is inherently an exemption. It is the statement that the corporation can engage in X, but any other corporation who engages in X on their \"turf\" is subject to the same violence and intimidation described earlier. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression, racketeering, or uphold the property rights of individuals.If a corporation collects \"taxes\", we must assume that it is not voluntary. Any \"voluntary\" payment of services would simply be called a payment, and any \"voluntary\" contribution to society would simply be called \"charity\". Taxation is based exclusively on where you reside or do business, ie, if you reside or do business within the geographic area that the institution claim, this amounts to \"tacit consent\" (ie, not consensual) to pay for products and services. We can not accept this as \"voluntary\" because people choose to stay in that geographic region any more than we can accept the Mafia\\'s collection of \"protection money\" as voluntary simply because a shopkeeper chooses not to move out of the neighborhood. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:To take, under threat of force, the product of somebody else\\'s labor, against their consent is \"theft\". To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting theft.The myth of legitimacy and the paradox of exemption:The core difference between \\'government\\' corporations and other corporations is the idea that these claims are somehow \"legitimate\", ie, that other corporations can not do these things without being in violation of the law, but institutions which are perceived as \\'legitimate\", or labeled as \"government\", can do these things without being in violation of the law. The myth of \"legitimacy\" is itself an example of \"arbitrary exemptions\". In essence, it is a matter of faith. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to use violence against you or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to take the product of your labor against your will or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has a legitimate claim to a geographical area or you do not, but the claim itself does not make it true, and the fact that this belief is held by so many also does not make it true (democracy itself is an appeal to the ad populum fallacy).In fact, faith is REQUIRED to accept such corporations as legitimate, because, as I have demonstrated, the attributes of these corporations are inherently inconsistent (ie, self-contradictory), and a concept must, at the very least, be internally consistent for it to qualify as \\'legitimate\\'.', 'This argument contains definitions which clarify my position. If you provide an example of a corporation, agency, institution or other body which does not meet the below criteria (ei, at least one of the three attributes listed are not present), or define \"crime\" as excplicitly including \"arbitrary exemptions\" (ie, a \"law\" that allows the state to violate other laws), then you are arguing against a straw man, EVEN IF such institution is accepted as a \"government\" using OTHER CRITERIA. When I am using the word \"government\", I am describing any number of institutions, with variations in size, scope, complexity, culture, laws, and location. However, I assert that all of these institutions have very specific characteristics in common, which I will sum up into three behavioral attributes: The creation of Laws and Law enforcement. The claim of monopoly rights over a geographic area. The collection of taxes. While there are many variations of structure and organization of such institutions, I will use these attributes to define government. Something labeled a \"government\" may not meet this criteria, and is therefor exempt from this . I define \"Criminal Organization\" as any organization which inherently commits crimes. Here, \"crime\" means a violation of applicable criminal law (if applied consistently to all moral actors regardless of arbitrary exemptions giving members of that organization the exclusive right to commit such crime). I contend that it is axiomatic - that the very same attributes which I here use to define a government are crimes, even within the scope of the very same laws that same government provides and enforces, and that arbitrary excemptions are necessary to cover up this obvious inconsistency.', 'For this round, will simply test con\\'s arguments out by using the same arguments for a known criminal institution as a baseline - the question is \"does the same line of argument justify the actions of the mafia?\". Since we know the actions of the mafia are not justifible or legitimate, we can assume any argument which justfies or legitimizes the criminal actions of the mafia are not valid. For this thought experiment, I will assume that the mob boss makes sizable donations to the orphanage he was raised in. Think of the orphans\"First off a law is a law and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the governments.\" First off a mob boss\\'s rules are the rules and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the mafia\\'s. You must first assume that the rules are legitimate before you can assume that the violence used to enforce those rules is justified. This is circular reasoning.\"criminal organizations dont give people rights\"Neither do governments. When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\", buy any right that isn\\'t codified is on the table, hence the state violating your property rights and rights of movement.\\'Yeah if asking nicely and giving you an option to choose youre own fate is counted as violence\\'If the mafia asks you nicely and gives you an option to choose whether you pay protection, aren\\'t you choosing you\\'re own fate?

If you don\\'t make any trouble, and keep your nose clean, you don\\'t got nothing to worry about.\"You cannot assume that [all governments are criminal organizations] just because 1 might qualify that all others do qualify.\"Like I said before, based on the definition of \\'crime\\', exluding any exeptions, all governments, as defined in this argument, are, de-facto, criminal organizations. It is axiomatic, like saying \"all apples are fruits\", and defining an apple as a \"fruit which grows on an apple tree\". The criteria for criminality explicitly includes the qualities specifically defined in government.\"You have yet to give proof that they are indeed criminal organizations.\"If these fictional governments have fictional laws which are enforced with fictional law enforcement and claim a monopoly over fictional geographic regions and collect fictional taxes, then they are fictional criminal organizations, unless you define \"crime\" as \"not crime\" or \"not crime when fictional governments do it\".\"Law enforcement still acknowledges that people have rights, that law enforcement is limited in how they treat people, and that law enforcement lives by codes and laws that they have to obey.\"The mob knows that people deserve respect, and there are certain things that they just won\\'t do. You treat them right, and they\\'ll treat you right. There\\'s even \"honor among theves\".\"for a government to work it needs taxes\"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money. Think of the orphans.\"you have still not offered evidence showing that each and every one of these are criminal organizations. \"You are shifting the onus. In essence, you are stating that I must deliver an infinite number of counter-arguments to these examples. You are doing this because, I suspect, you don\\'t understand the axiomatic nature of my argument. My argument works with all possible governments in all possible universes, as long as they meet the criteria.You have asserted several times that I have offered \"no proof\" that governments are criminal organizations. To say this is to miss the point etirely. If I say that all apples are fruits and define apple as a fruit, then, yes, ALL apples are fruits, definately and definitively. You are saying that there are fictional apples, and put the onus on me to prove that all fictional apples are fruits, when you ignore the definition of \"apple\" stated to avoid exactly that kind of confusion.The rest of your argument is a repetition of the same points - \"yeah, but...\". Yeah, but governments pay for good things. Yeah, but governments punish bad people. Yeah, but governments give us free goodies. Yeah, but governments protect us from evil warlords. This may all be entirely true, but it is also irrelevant, as I am not saying that providing these services is a criminal act any more than the mob boss giving money to an orphanage is a criminal act. It\\'s not what they do with their money and power (most of the time), it\\'s how they get the money, and how they keep their power. You also choose to argue against some of my rhetorical statements I made during the round you forfieted. I could engage in those extraneous argument, but it would take too long and detract from the point.Your final diatribe against anarchism is an ad hominum attack. Yes, I\\'m an \"anarchist\" because I don\\'t believe in morally justifiable INITIATIONS of force. Just calling me an \"anarchist\" is a de-facto straw man since you obviously have a misunderstanding of my position, so can not possibly address my arguments which defend them. I could be a satanist, child-molesting drug-dealing murderous psychopath, but that wouldn\\'t change the substance of my argument.\"Governments give people rights\"Rights are \"unalienable\". They do not come from government. Government, if anything. codifies and (alegedly) protects some rights at the expense of violation other rights\".\"Governments acknowledge people\\'s property rights\"Government can not protect your property by taking it by force.\"Governments provide services to its people\"Not nearly as many services as the free market does.\"Governments puts criminals, murderers, and rapists in jail\"Success rate is about 10% in the US. US government also murders people in brutal wars, and uses the fear of rape to gain your obedience.\"Governments fund jails to keep criminals in\"It also defines what a \"criminal\" is, and can put you in jail for not obeying it.\"Governments acknowledge the right to bear arms, Anarchies dont\"That is the exact opposite of the truth, much like many other things you\\'ve said. Here\\'s the thing, If you were born in a hospital, been to a hospital, seen a dentist, or gone to a school, then the government has spent money on you.... So the government does spend money on EVERYONE', 'When the world was confronted with the observations of Copernicus, and the theories of a heliocentric solar system, it was a dramatic shock to the existing world view that the entire world would be fundamentally different than what people had accepted for centuries.When the world was confronted with the protestant movement, it was a dramatic charge that the \"one true faith\" could be called into question, that alternatives to such a ubiquitous and powerful institution could be created simply by asking those questions, and formulating alternative answers.When the world was confronted with abolitionists, it was a dramatic realization that slavery was wrong, yet some stuck to their existing perceptions, and ignored the obvious immorality of the institution.When the world was confronted with the woman\\'s suffrage movement, it was a dramatic and scary thought to some that women be given the same rights as men.When the world was confronted with such scientific breakthroughs as the theory of evolution, or Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, it was a dramatic paradigm shift, which left many people dazed and confused.Yet, we all accept that these things were correct, and the dominant paradigms of the time were wrong. We all accept that truth marches on, and that the future MUST, as well, be filled with surprising revelations about the ideas and institutions we take for granted.Is it really hard to accept that the next to be called into question is the dominant institution of our day? Is it really that far of a stretch to think that institutions (governments) which killed nearly 300 million people in the 20th century may not be rational? Is it really hard to accept that using an institution which steals nearly half the nation\\'s income is not a good strategy for protecting property rights? Is it hard to figure out that the more soldiers \"fight for our freedom\", the less freedom we actually have, as measured by the massive amount of legislation coming out of Washington, from SOPA and PIPA to the NDAA and the Patriot Act?We can either choose to be on the right side of history, or we can choose to indulge in the delusion that the status quo is always correct - a delusion that, history has shown, will almost always be wrong.', '\"law enforcement coming from the government comes in the forms of fines, penalties, and maybe an arrest if the crimes are severe enough.\"There are many different forms of \"punishment\" for non-obedience, up to and including being shot. The violence, however, tends to show itself clearly only when the other intimidation techniques don\\'t achieve the objective of your obedience. In the US, for instance, you may get a fine, but that fine is essentially an extortion notice, and is itself an act of intimidation. You must pay, or else. If you do not pay that fine, they can increase the intimidation. For instance, they can send you a court date, which is to say, they can demand that you appear before them. If you do not show up, they can issue a warrant for your arrest, which is to say, they create a document which \"authorizes\" somebody to abduct you against your will. Even that is nice language meant to play down what actually happens, as the truth, at least in the US, is that men with guns come to your house, tie you up in metal shackles, throw you in a vehicle, many times a windowless van, and toss you in a cage that is famous for being a place where you will be beaten and raped*.If you defend yourself from this horrific threat of abduction and prison rape, you will be shot - murdered, slaughtered, executed, put down like a pig, and the only \"crimes\" you committed were disobedience and self-defense.\"law enforcement doesn\\'t come from violence and intimidation\"Law enforcement IS violence and intimidation, and it is explicitly so. There are plenty of justifications for this violence and intimidation, (ie, claiming that it is a \"necessary evil\"), but saying they have nothing to do with each other is like saying war has nothing to do with killing people. Not only is it not true, it is the exact opposite of truth. \"You are allowed to move beyond boundaries between governments though, they are called passports and it happens all the time. \"You are contradicting yourself. If I am required to ask permission to do something (passport), then, ipso-facto, I am not \"allowed\" to do it. The idea that I would be \"allowed\" to move beyond those borders with permission implicitly asserts that the corporation has the right to deny me access, which is the exact opposite of me being \"allowed\" to cross those borders. Let\\'s say you didn\\'t even need a passport, and you could just freely move across borders - that is irrelevant to the question of how the corporation behaves within those borders. Building walls and having checkpoints on the borders is just one more example of criminal behavior on the part of these corporations. Much like \"taxation\", it is something that, if you or I attempted to do to a third party, it would immediately be recognized as criminal behavior.\"So taxes may be involuntary, but they are a necessary evil\"Whether you believe it is \"necessary\" is irrelevant. It has been argued that the black market is \"necessary\", as well, but that is irrelevant to whether it is criminal. Slavery was once thought of as a \"necessary evil\", but that doesn\\'t change the nature of slavery.Also, you forget that it is not \"the people\" government spends money on, as there is no such thing as \\'the people\". The government takes money from SOME people and uses it to benefit OTHER people. The size of the groups involved are irrelevant. For instance, not all people agree with you that taxes are \"accepted as necessary evils\".Even if that money was spent to improve society, and that 99.99% of the population approves of the spending, it is still a violation of the law unless we allow for an exemption - you even admit this yourself by calling taxation a necessary \"evil\". What is \"evil\" about being consistent with our values and rules? For us to consider it \"evil\", it must be a violation of our value system.\" That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass\"...except the ones that have exemptions that allow them to violate the law, which, I still maintain, is all of them. I freely acknowledge that government agencies and individuals working for government are subject to some of the laws that the rest of us are. However, a criminal is still a criminal if he breaks even one criminal law, regardless of how many laws he obeys. If that criminal could decide what the laws are, there is no reason for him to give himself an exemption for laws he doesn\\'t want to violate - just the ones preventing stealing, intimidation, racketeering, etc... just like governments do.\"Those governments are not criminal organizations because even though they create laws and enforce them, have rights over a region, and collect taxes, they are fictional governments and thus are not criminal organizations even though they count as governments.\"There are many fictional crime families out there. To the extent that they are fictional, their crimes are fictional, but that doesn\\'t change the fact that they are criminal. What you are essentially saying:In order to argue your case, you have done the following: Claimed that law enforcement (law enFORCEment) has nothing to do with force, violence, or intimidation, even though the exact opposite is demonstrably true. Claimed that taxation is a \"special case\" because \"the people\" (ie, you, and people who agree with you) consider it a \\'necessary evil\\'. In other words, it is exempt from our standards and is \"legal\" even though it violates other laws - exactly my point. Used fictional (FICTIONAL!) governments as examples of governments which are not criminal (even though they still are criminal as fictional governments). In short, you have produced no compelling reasons to dismiss my arguments. * http://reason.com...', 'There are a few things I need to bring up this round. 1) My opponent makes the claim that the music is terrible, however, he does not provide any evidence for this claim, not even a sample of the music for us to make the determination.

I hope for a good debate.I thank you.\", 'Hello, Fred. This is one of my favorite subjects, and I am glad to have this debate with you. The photons emitting from my computer screen have triggered a complicated cause and effect, resulting in me accepting the challenge. I would like to start off by establishing what free will is. We are discussing the theoretical ability of the mind to make decisions of its own, and to control its own fate. I would now like to speculate on the nature of a mind. Its home is the brain. The brain is a physical object, which acts like any other physical object. Chemical reactions occur within it, which makes our \"decisions\" and \"thoughts\". You will refute by saying that we control our decisions. If you see a plate of food in front of you would eat it, right? If there was no plate of food there, would you have still made the decision to eat it? No. Of course not, several things, including the smell of the food, and your vision that reveals the food, CAUSED you to eat it. The brain is such an endlessly complex thing, but it still follows rules and cause and effect just like anything else. The nature of this speculation is incredible, as it is that of a brain pondering on the workings of it. We can, of course, never fully understand and predict the complex chemical reactions of a brain. Because we may not predict it, we assume it controls its own fate. The same may be applied to the rolling of a die. No man can predict what number it will land on when tossed across a game- board. We perceive it to be random. Though it is obvious that it is not random, and the die still follows the laws of physics, and every little crumb on the table that the die comes across, causes the die to make a slightly different course. Let\\'s look back to history, shall we? In the very early ages, before science, people would perceive that things such as rain were the will of gods, and would dance and what not for rain. Of course none of them could perceive of water being held in clouds, evaporation or what not, so they assume that the rain has a will of its own. In our advanced era, we know that rain is caused by a predictable system of cause and effect. How is our brain any different? I have no wish to turn this into a theological debate, for I am an atheist. I will note however, that there is in fact, theological determinism. You should look it up. It is the belief that god controls the actions of Humans. wrote more ethic and sci can post round 1 or in comments. prefference?', 'Hello, In actuality, what is later discovered to be invalid was in fact invalid from the start, but this is irrelevant. Instinct and what you perceive to be \"rational thought\" (but what is really just extremely complex cause and effect which appear to be rational) are deeply intermingled. No, you either did do as I proposed, or you didn\\'t, and to the fortune of your co-workers you did the latter. It is not as if you \"could\" have done something else. At the time, I could not predict the future (My mind did not know all the variables), and thus was not positive which crossroad events would inevitably take, and it may have been perceived by some, that it was random, or that events chose the crossroad. But now, that we can look back to the past (based on memory) and observe the outcome, we can reasonably conclude that the equation could only add up to your un-compliance with my friendly suggestion. Let me explain this mathematically: We will use a simple equation for this experiment, quite unlike the complex equations of the mind. The equation is: 2+3. We, in this context, know all variables involved: 2 and 3. Using our knowledge of all the variables in question, and our mind\\'s amazing computing ability, we can predict the future and say it will equal 5. This is a much simplified version, however. In reality, being the humans with oh so limited minds; we would NOT know all the variables. Let\\'s say that we only knew the existence of 2. We would not know what all variables might be included, so estimates of the results could be any figure. We cannot predict the outcome with the limited info. After the thing itself happened, and we observed that it was 5 that ended up happening, we know that it could not have been anything else that was the answer, for 2+3, despite your philosophies WILL ALWAYS equal 5. According to your ideas, 2+3, could \"choose\" to equal 7, or 10, or 23,476,353,658,346. This is obviously untrue. Series of events, in actuality follow one path, there are no crossroads; the crossroads are just illusions. And this is the easiest answer to the question of free will, and we may conclude that free-will does not exist. The mind does not control math. Math is undisputable. You cannot deny the logic I have provided above. To answer your question, 2 and 3 force you to choose something. The matter of free-will is not about forcing to do something against your will; it is about forcing your will to do whatever. It makes you \"choose\" what you choose. I have proved that the mind is not infinite, but 2+3 cannot equal an infinite amount of things, it can only equal one thing. If it was infinite, my mind could control the universe (and trust me, if I controlled the universe, things would be a lot more amusing). The computer is indeed a good analogy for the brain, because the computer, like the brain, has no free will. Your analogy seems to agree with my side. Anyways, I suppose it would be \"possible\", as in we don\\'t know for sure any variables that deny it, but I strongly doubt that the equation of events will equal humans building such a computer. There are many variables including even such things as the human race being wiped out before we reached the level of technology. AS for your differentiation between Humans and other animals, I say: a brain is a brain, brains don\\'t have freewill. Look at this article: http://www.apa.org... It shows how similar human and chimpanzee brains are. You earlier proposed a sort of \"micro evolution\", evolution takes millions of years, Fred. So we can reasonably look back…6 thousand years and conclude that human\\'s brains are not dissimilar from humans. Infants born and raised today constantly are raised in the environment of the information age. The minds of 6 thousand years ago, which we can conclude are basically the same as now, lived as animals, so I do not see your connection. Fred, I am dearly sorry, but I can not explain to you all the variables involved in the decisions and psychological processes of gamblers, and drunkards. You keep asking for a simple explanation of why the gambler does something, and someone else does another thing, but I can\\'t give a simple explanation of these processes. Those statements do not necessarily disagree with my arguments. Brain tissue can change shape. You CANT defy nature, Fred. Nature is to broad a sense. Nature is simply the nature of how things are, how they work and why they exist in such a form. You\\'re brain cells do not choose in what direction they go, or how they multiply. You drastically misunderstood my last paragraph (not your fault, just the confusion of limited man-made language). I was not complaining that you were asking \"why\" to much, I was complaining that you WERE NOT asking \"why\" enough, I think that you are not asking \"Why\" enough. I want you to ask \"why\" more. Does it make sense to you now? -Harlan', 'Hello Science itself, by definition can not be mistaken, while scientific theories can be disproved (thus eliminating the \"Science\" element of it). The idea that people use free will to decide whether they want free will is ludicrous (it is like saying, \"vote no if you don\\'t want democracy\"). A thought can certainly cause another thought to form. All a \"thought\" is, is the complex-calculator-that-is-the-mind\\'s process that you are aware of. Assuming that you were \"sane\" (a relevant term, mind you), my mind concluded that you would not be able to carry out my thoughtful suggestion. I was right. You could not do it. Your mind kept you from doing it. \"While I could very well choose to do any of those things that you suggest, I would more than likely choose not to do them\" You \"could\" have done them? If our world fo0llows cause and vent, I was aware that if something in the past did or did not happen, there was no other possible course of events, as there is no such thing as randomness. You \"more than likely\" would have done what you did? Things are not random, Fred. Things only happen if things cause them to happen. Are you saying that the mind has infinite possibilities? This is obviously not true…the mind is limited at some point. Do not get me wrong, the Human mind has a very complex system for deciding courses of action, but not infinite. Well, it depends what you mean by \"infinite\", for inside the number 1, there is an infinite amount of variations (1.1, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, 1.00001, 1.000001, 1.132432543246322542523) The mind is not capable of everything, though. Theoretically, the human mind could be predicted, but because of the chaos theory, it would be INCREDIBLY difficult, but once more, the Human mind is not capable of everything, and it would take well over a lifetime (WELL, well over) to factor in and understand all the variables in the universe, for one moment in time. I doubt that we will create a computer if such computing power, because where would we get all the information? You can not fit a universe in a computer. Way, way too much information. It is probably not something we could do. Though strictly theoretically, it is \"possible\". How could I make the assertion that you would not do the actions I asked of you to take? Of course I did not know all the variables of the Universe, and thus I was not sure, but I knew that few minds were allowed to work in this manner, though some might be forced to. I do not believe in such a thing as a god \"investing\" free will in someone (side-note: who put the freewill in the god?). While we are in a scientific debate, you must agree that a Human is an animal. You stated yourself: \"animals do not have free will\". Do you concede, then? Or do you take that back? Or would you make the argument that scientifically Humans are not animals (which is unfactual)? Or do you revise that statement to say: \"animals, exempt Humans, do not have freewill\". I would be OK with this. Though our brains work the exact same way as other animals. The purpose of quoting Einstein was that not only does he have great understanding of things, and would be a great person for input, he summed it up very nicely. God does not play dice indeed, and accordingly nothing is random or happening for no reason, thus there being no freewill. Since we are debating with the context of science, the scientific world is a logical one. In this world (our world) things happen because things made them happen, not because they decide to happen. No offense, but I don\\'t think you\\'re going deep enough, Fred. You must keep asking \"why\" on every aspect. WHY do we do this? WHY does our mind decide that? WHAT made it decide that? WHY did it make it decide that? Things happen for reasons. You are just floating on the surface when you say that the mind has memories, but somehow those brain cells decide their own fate. You need to delve, and try to find the reason for each and every aspect. And therein lies the answer, everything has a reason, and thus the brain cells cannot decide their own fate. -Harlan', 'This topic has been discussed since the earliest of times and involves religious, ethical, and scientific implications. In the realm of theology, the Creator does not assert His omnipotent power over individual will thereby allowing humans to make choices. On an ethical plane, without free will, how can we hold anyone morally accountable for their actions. While great strides have been made in scientifically mapping the thought process, the actions of the body are not wholly determined by physical causality. The question is: Does the machine (brain) control the soul or does the soul control the machine? In contemplating on whether or not to issue this challenge, I weighed all of the options and possibilities (consequences) of my contemplated action and decided to go ahead and issue the challenge. My intention is not to win or loose the debate, but supply a forum where ideas can be freely exchanged in a refreshing, open atmosphere without rancor.', 'Harlan, the definition of science is:\" ability to produce solutions in some problem domain.\" It is a fact that solutions that were valid yesterday, may become invalid today based upon further research. Sometimes, the scientist comes to a conclusion based upon flawed data making his conclusion invalid – or a mistake. I don\\'t think I said people decide on whether or not they want free will. I do say that man has the ability to use free will, or he can choose not to thereby utilizing only that portion of his brain that responds to instinct, the reptilian brain. A thought certainly can form another thought. \"I think I will write a book,\" may produce another thought: \"What kind of book will I write?\" I am glad that you assumed that I am sane. In doing so you might have even placed a wager on my response because, being sane, why would I want to do things that are considered by most to be insane? The fact remains that I could have done some of those things you proposed (I once danced onstage acting like a stripper akin to wearing a pink tutu to work) but I considered the consequences and decided they were not things that I should do, especially at work! What would force me to do something that I choose not to do? I truly believe that the power of the mind is infinite. The more we use it, the better we get at doing things. Doesn\\'t it seem that each generation seems \"smarter\" than the previous ones? Perhaps we are observing a micro-second of evolution? When computers first were developed, they were the size of a room. Today, I am working on a minuscule laptop going at corvette speeds compared to the model T speed of the older ones. Computers will continually evolve into smarter, faster machines because someone decided to study and research computer technology and take it to the next level by experimentation. If it is theoretically possible, then it can be done…we just haven\\'t figured out how yet! Again, we will leave the origin of free will to the theological debate and remain in the scientific realm. Miriam-Webster defines human as \"of, relating to, or characteristic of humans: a: having human form or attributes b: susceptible to or representative of the sympathies and frailties of human nature.\" An example would be all Native Americans are Native Americans, but not all are Wampanoag Native Americans. Something sets them apart. While man may be described as a \"bi-pedal mammal\" something sets us apart from all other mammals: our ability to make decisions, to make choices, to exercise free will. We can ask the questions: \"Who? What? Why? What are the consequences? Then we can decide to act, or not act. I am an addict (alcohol being a drug)science tells me that I inherited a genetic makeup that made me so. Science can demonstrate that prolonged use of the drug causes further alterations within my brain chemistry. That makes sense. I took something that caused a change that effected my brain. However, a pathological gambler never ingests anything yet science shows the same brain chemistry changes as the alcoholic. But, the pathological gambler never ingested anything to cause the effect on the brain. His repetitive behavior (or, thinking)did. Sort of like mind over matter, wouldn\\'t you say? By doing certain things over and over again I have developed a newer habit (sobriety) that defies my genetic nature and the changes caused to my brain chemistry by continued use of the drug. Certainly not an easy feat but I haven\\'t had a drink in almost seven years. Defies nature, don\\'t you think? The fact is I first tried recovery back in 1998 but I only have seven years of \"clean time.\" Recovery didn\\'t work until I chose to do the things necessary to make it work despite my genetic makeup! I chose! Things (planets, trees, etc.) certainly do not make things work. I make things work by using my intellect and my freedom to choose what to make work. Perhaps, Harlan, my \"why\" questions are meant for you to think about my statements in a different way than you have in the past. Everything does have a reason but man has not been able to discover every reason just yet. Logical is defined as being \"capable of or reflecting the capability for correct and valid reasoning; a logical mind.\" Truth is, life can be illogical at times.']\n"

            "[\"The resolution used by Pro *assumes* that Australia isn't already a 'significant' country - however, in actual reality, it is. Firstly we should clarify what significance means: 1.a the state or quality of being significant1.b of consequence or importance==================================To respond directly to Pros argument first:he/she asserts that Australia invented 'amazing things' like 'WiFI, Google Maps, Polymer bank notes, Ultrasound scanners, stainless steel braces and many more things'. Now, if these inventions did come from Australia, then, it can be considered a 'significant country' - as a country which is the home of some of the most universally-used inventions in the 21st century. It would seem that Pro was/is trying to argue that Australia simply deserves more recognition, in which case he/she should proposed that instead of stating that it should be more 'significant' - because the examples that Pro themselves has listed, fully go against that. Instead of affirming the resolution, Pro has negated it. After all, insignificant countries do not invent things such as WiFi or Google Maps. One invention listed by Pro that I will take issue with though is the ultrasound, as this was not invented in Australia. Its first use is thought to have been in Austria, which is a country in Europe. Its technology developed from there. 'The use of ultrasound in medicine began during and shortly after the 2nd World War in various centres around the world. The work of Dr. Karl Theodore Dussik in Austria in 1942 on transmission ultrasound investigation of the brain provides the first published work on medical ultrasonics.' 'Although other workers in the USA, Japan and Europe have also been cited as pioneers, the work of Professor Ian Donald and his colleagues in Glasgow, in the mid 1950s, did much to facilitate the development of practical technology and applications.'[1.] https://www.bmus.org...\", 'I accept.', 'First of all we invented amazing things like WiFi, Google Maps, Polymer bank notes (if you are American and do not know what they are, they are plastic WATERPROOF bills), Ultrasound scanners, stainless steel braces and many more things. Why put us into the shadow if we have made such amazing things the whole world uses nowadays! I bet you have used at the very least ONE thing I put up there unless you are on a Ethernet cable still using those old paper maps wherever you go! There is no point in putting such smart people who made these things in the shadow! Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!', 'Australia has always been put into the shadow behind countries like America, Canada and even England sometimes, I feel Australia should not be put in the darkness and in this debate I will tell you why.', 'Alright then.', 'A forfeit? Alright. Unexpected.', '* Paragraph 1 is simply you writing 67 words in a row and having none of them relate to the current topic of debate. There was no reason to have that paragraph except to make you appear more intelligent. This is meaningless as your further arguments clarify that you are intelligent and I ask you refrain from attempting this in further debates. I feel no further need to address it. * \" Its not YOUR religion. You don\"t own it. \" this is true. I do not own my religion. However, How would you like me to refer to it as? If I always adressed it as: \"The religion that I, As a christian, Believe in, \" It would lead to run-on sentences and spotty grammar. \"My religion\" Is much faster, However I will try to refrain from using that term in the future. If you spot it, Please inform me. * \"Why try at all? \" You are very well educated and I\\'m confused that with your knowledge of the bible you do not know the answer to this. All Christians have been commissioned to spread our belief\\'s throughout the world, As can be seen throughout the new testament (ex Matthew 28: 1-20). My question is this: why do you try? For what purpose do you waste your time debating on this website, Trying to convince people you know in advance are set on their beliefs? You have nothing to gain. Even if you convince someone, So what? Their just another person across the globe on a debating website who is now a atheist. I can\\'t see how it affects you at all. *\"Which first paragraph? \" My apologies. I see now my opening argument was poorly labeled. You were correct in assuming I was referring to Leviticus 14:33-57. I will try in the future to better label my arguments *\"Sooooo many problems with that one. 1. First you have to demonstrate, Test and thus prove your god exists in which case nobody has ever done in the entire existence of the human race. 2. Which means there\"s no such a thing as any miracles 3. Suppose someone does manage to prove your god then you would have to assert this god exists to the rest of the world with over 33, 000 denominations of Christianity alone. Now I don\"t mean to sound insulting, But tee hee! So which denomination of YOUR Christianity is correct? . \" I will address this point by point. In that argument, I did not have to prove the existence of God. You had made the argument that if God did exist, He would not tell the Israelites such outlandish things. Since you were working on the basis that God existed, My rebuttal to that argument did not need to prove the existence of God. If these were different circumstances, Yes, I would need to prove the existence of God. This also applies to 2, So I will take this time to address something else. All throughout your debate, You use quotation marks instead of apostrophe\\'s (ex there\"s). Please refrain from this in the future. In point number 3, You claim there is \"33, 000\". I have no clue where you got this absurd number from, As you did not provide a source. I can\\'t even find a hundredth of that many denominations, And so I must believe you pulled that number from thin air. You ask which denomination is correct. To which I answer this. I do not know. As I have said multiple times in advance, I do not have all knowledge. I simply try to do the best I can with what little knowledge I have. * \"It really p**ses me off that supposed christians like you who are not christians at all, Because there is no such a thing as being a christian, And you just proved it, Because you nor anyone can possibly pay any attention to YOUR god\"s laws that are befitting by your god in your lap. No! You and every other supposed christian has to make up their own rules to what suits them, To how they want, To their needs and desires\" I could take potshots at this, Pointing out the poor conduct and the run on sentences. However you have addressed in advance you do not care about conduct despite this being a formal debate. Instead, I ask this question of you. If we \"make up their own rules to what suits them\" why do we follow such restricting rules? Why would we believe that you shouldn\\'t lust, Or lie, When those things could benefit us? If we made the rules, Why would we make the rules so hard to follow? But if a unfathomable God made the rules, It would only make sense that the standard would be harder, As we are not gods. * \"Regardless your god MURDERED 2, 821, 364 in YOUR bible, \" Again, You pull out a incredibly specific number (2, 821, 364) with no source. I ask you to back up these numbers in the future. Regardless, I do not believe that there is a verse you can pull up that cannot be justified. You have left two of my earlier points un-rebbuted, Instead choosing to simply rage quit. Regardless, I know in advance that the two us will never come to a agreement. I also know that the likelihood of me winning this debate is slim, As even a idiot could see that you are far better educated and experienced. If you do not want to continue this debate, Simply inform me. As always, I look forward to your response.', 'Here I am again, Knowing full well that it is likely you will best me. Regardless, I would be a disgrace to my religion if I did not try. I will try to rebut your points. I hope that I meet your criteria, But regardless if I do not I will debate to the best of my abilities. If you consider me non-intelligent (which is unfortunately likely), Please tell me upfront so I may leave the debate as respectively as I can. * Your first paragraph details how you believe that the bible is man made. However, Allow me to explain how your point is flawed. The outlandishness of the law is not proof that the bible is man-made, Quite the opposite. If God had simply told the Israelites a practical way to cure leprosy (chemically engineer dapsone), Then it would not be a miracle. However, If God chose the most outlandish set of instructions and the lepers were healed, Then Israel could not deny it was a miracle. This was needed because Israel had the habit of instantaneously following other gods that allowed them to have no rules or restrictions. * You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. As the old proverb goes, \"Blood leads to blood. Violence into more violence. Revenge is just another name for Murder\". You also forget that the man who was slain gains eternal riches in the next life. If that muderer continues to do evil, He will receive damnation * One: that verse was a parable. Here is a source explaining it https://www. Biblestudytools. Com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-19-12. Html. Two: even if it was not a parable, We are talking a God that created the laws of physics. Nothing is physically impossible * Here is a source explaining that verse: http://apologeticspress. Org/apcontent. Aspx? Category=6&article=301 *\"Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one Jesus? After all this Christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. \" Jesus was not sent to stop physical war on earth. Jesus was sent to stop the spiritual war that had been raging on since satan\\'s fall. Because the 80 years we live on this earth is a pittance compared to the 1000\\'s on 1000\\'s we live afterwards. As for those who started such wars without cause, They will be damned. Conclusion: I will not claim to have all knowledge. I will not claim to be the smartest in my nation or my religion or even of my family. However, Even a fool such as I know this. The bible, A book that is constantly under fire, Has managed to survive and flourish since 4000 b. C. In between then and now it has been threatened by some of the most powerful men in the world (ex. Adolf Hitler who aimed to burn all religious materials) and has survived. It has stood against the harshest critics including scientists, Philosophers, And historians all of whom failed to find deceisive evidence that the bible was false. And that seems like a miracle too me. Regardless, I thank you for your time', 'Why is it that so-called christians, Because there is no such a thing as a christian, Have serious trouble as READING and COMPREHENDING? Its not that difficult, Nor is it that hard. It was stated unto you a very simple \"* \"You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. \" OK we\"re done. You paid absolutely no attention whatsoever to the verses presented and instead went off into your own la la land. \" But nah, All you did was babble on and on and on. So in this sense, It was YOU that forfeited. Sheesh! Bye.', '\"Here I am again, \" Are you sure its you? You know you could be somebody else pretending to be you. Did you pinch yourself to make sure its you and or put a bullet in your kneecaps to make sure its you? Probably not. So then you don\"t know if its you in a flabbergassesed reality of your own making then you have no idea as to what is the outcome of your past being part of your present future. Right? Anyway\" \"Regardless, I would be a disgrace to my religion\"\" See right there you fumble. Its not YOUR religion. You don\"t own it. And you most certainly don\"t own your superior ego god complex in which your joke of a bible is entirely about and nothing else, In which you cannot prove its immoral god even exists as the verses stated in RD1 prove. They are completely laughable at best in which no god of sheer stupidity would even dream about composing. But then again, No god of superior ego god complex would ever, Not for any reason, Dream of using text, Namely your bible as a form of communication, Transmission, Correspondence, Conformity, Publication etc pe-ir-od. \"if I did not try\" Well see, Why try at all? Why try for a completely immoral character that your god unquestionably is and your bible without a doubt proves this? But only if you\"ve read and comprehended the damn thing. Did you do this? \"If you consider me non-intelligent (which is unfortunately likely), \" No. I consider you to be not knowing any better and defending something that you cannot possibly defend. * \"Your first paragraph details how you believe that the bible is man made. \" Which first paragraph? 2 Timothy 3:16, Proverbs 30:5, Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, Rules for this debate, The biggest laugh in the bible? Leviticus 14:33-57? Oh I see, Its NOT the first paragraph in the bible, Its Leviticus 14:33-57 in which is wayyyyyyy down the ladder. Nitpicking am I? No because its very hard to follow you. \"However, Allow me to explain how your point is flawed. \" Actually its not. No \"god\" would ---ever--- be stupid enough, With a full octane of nothing but drab to invent such bombastic impressioned imperfect silliness. It really is that simple. So since this is ultimately true, And no supposed laughing toodles \"god\" would horrifically be flat out ignorant enough to invent that law, Then who and or what did? I get it from your standpoint. It must be a blade of grass, Or a playbore bunny, A you know where area itch that won\"t go away, A god from the undergrowth from another planet. Hey, You\\'ve got trillions of choices.

So have fun in believing in your supermassive contradictory hypocritical unproven god. Yeah its perfectly OK for your god to murder, But not man? But wait, Your god orders man to murder for him? Wow. Bye. Do you want some REAL truth? Simply google it. Google something like \"bible verses where god kills babies\".', '2 Tiimothy 3:16 \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, And is profitable for doctrine, For reproof, For correction, For instruction in righteousness:\" Proverbs 30:5 \"Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. \" Welcome welcome welcome to the silliness absurdities in god and the bible and why you should not believe in god for obvious reasons: Rules for this debate: 1.

Reading it its truly hilarious. In no way would any supreme deity -ever- concoct this obvious man made, And what MAN would think this trash heap up, Law up, Put it into effect and expect anybody to believe it AND expect everybody to follow it? I really like the use of a bird for solutions. Does anybody buy this dippy cabbage batbrain obnoxious stuff gunk? Well yeah. If you are uneducated and unintelligent and you believe in god. Leviticus 14:33-57 \"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, Saying, 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, Which I give to you for a possession, And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, Saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, Before the priest go into it to see the plague, That all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: 37 And he shall look on the plague, And, Behold, If the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, Greenish or reddish, Which in sight are lower than the wall; 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, And shut up the house seven days: 39And the priest shall come again the seventh day, And shall look: and, Behold, If the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, And they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, And they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 42 And they shall take other stones, And put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, And shall plaister the house. 43 And if the plague come again, And break out in the house, After that he hath taken away the stones, And after he hath scraped the house, And after it is plaistered; 44 Then the priest shall come and look, And, Behold, If the plague be spread in the house, It is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 45 And he shall break down the house, The stones of it, And the timber thereof, And all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 48 And if the priest shall come in, And look upon it, And, Behold, The plague hath not spread in the house, After the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, Because the plague is healed. 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, And cedar wood, And scarlet, And hyssop: 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, And the hyssop, And the scarlet, And the living bird, And dip them in the blood of the slain bird, And in the running water, And sprinkle the house seven times: 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, And with the running water, And with the living bird, And with the cedar wood, And with the hyssop, And with the scarlet: 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, And make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, And scall, 55 And for the leprosy of a garment, And of a house, 56 And for a rising, And for a scab, And for a bright spot: 57 To teach when it is unclean, And when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. \" Yep. People\"s limbs falling off while they are waiting for a bird to do unto them magical prowess is such a stroke of utter hypnotic comedic failure that is god and the bible. Only a completely insane man or woman could have made that one up. Yes, Without a doubt god and the bible are clearly man made. * This is how the bible and god investigates a murder. Yes with great envy, This is how our court system should absolutely 100% work in this country! Why not? Thankfully we have intelligence, Dignity and integrity, Unlike god and the bible. Great going with all your smarts and brain activity god. Keep it going! This is a true joke unto itself and why god and the bible cannot possibly be taken seriously. . . . Deuteronomy 21: 1-9 \"If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, Lying in the field, And it be not known who hath slain him: 2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, And they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 3 And it shall be, That the city which is next unto the slain man, Even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, Which hath not been wrought with, And which hath not drawn in the yoke; 4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, Which is neither eared nor sown, And shall strike off the heifer\\'s neck there in the valley: 5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, And to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 6 And all the elders of that city, That are next unto the slain man, Shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, Neither have our eyes seen it. 8 Be merciful, O LORD, Unto thy people Israel, Whom thou hast redeemed, And lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel\\'s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, When thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. \" Indeed so this is how according to the laws of the bible that how to investigate a murder should that place? Well appoint me as a judge so I can insanely let everybody go! * Matthew 19:12 \"For there are some eunuchs, Which were so born from their mother\\'s womb: and there are some eunuchs, Which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, Which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\\'s sake. He that is able to receive it, Let him receive it. \" Um yeah um OK well that\"s physically impossible and could -never- happen. Duh. Regardless, Its a pretty sick verse. But what can one expect emanating from the sickest book ever written? * Judges 1:19 \"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, Because they had chariots of iron. \" Wow. God must be that weak. Since this mighty god has no power against the weak chariots of iron, One has to wonder if he has the power to defeat a gamma ray burst should one come this way? Clearly a misprint in the bible or god is man made. * Here\\'s a thinking, Rationalizing, Reasoning, Common sense, Logical question(s) (there are too many to count) in which religion, God and the bible has none: Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one jesus? After all this christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. . . Evil, Anger, Vengeance, Rage, Fury, Jealousy etc. Clearly more than one jesus was needed, Required and was necessary to have carried out god\"s word to have provided peace, Love, Care and kindness. But let\"s be honest here, That\"s not what god wanted, Otherwise he would have sent more than one jesus. He would have sent hundreds, Thousands, Millions. They could have all spoken in the same tongue that god would have wanted them to have spoken in. OR HERE\"S THE KICKER, HE COULD HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF! But its clear that god didn\"t want any of this. God instead wants turmoil and hate, Not peace by any means. Its what keeps god in office and gives him a job. After all what happens if the world happens to live in peace? God would have nothing to do. No one to b**ch at. No one to rule. No one to murder. No one to make war with. For all of those who have answered \"Only one jesus was needed\", Well you\"ve just answered your own question with an answer. Your precious jesus, In which there is absolutely no proof for him having ever existed in the first place as well as god, Is why there is so much hatred in this world. * Summary: The bible is littered with rules and regulations that no god/ supreme deity would -ever- put into play and much less expect people to believe, Much less live by them. Yet the bible is supposed to be perfect in every way. So is god. Clearly both are not. Since this is true, God, The bible and christianity should not in any way be worshiped, Idolized, Bowed down to nor yielded to.', 'Thanks to PRO for his/her response and for returning to the debate. I will be taking PRO\\'s arguments in the final round into consideration seeing that he has been subject to unfair circumstances. I will start off by addressing PRO\\'s rebuttals against my case and then proceed to argue against his substantives.Defences against PRO\\'s rebuttals D1) Rebuttal 1PRO concedes to the fact that this \"might be true\", then makes an attempt to rebuke this by saying that he personally finds this very difficult. This is by no means adequate justification that Person A is on the back foot from the very start of a debate. What is difficult for PRO might be easy for another debater due to disparities in knowledge of the topic, debating proficiency and other factors. PRO needs to bring to the table factual and concrete analysis of the nature and roles of Person A and B that is consistent for all debaters, which he has not done so, to prove that Person A does indeed have a more difficult job to fulfill.D2) Rebuttal 2PRO\\'s response to this point does not yield any strength for his stance. He relates the purpose of debate which to convince the opponent with the emphasis that DDO\\'s voting mechanism places on arguments. My point about Person A slacking off was to prove the proportionate nature of difficulty between the two sides of the house, not to disprove the inherent attributes of a debate. Besides, both Person A and B are judged based off of the same voting criteria, thus this does not clash with my case which argues for the conditional equilibrium between the two sides of the house.D3) Rebuttal 3APRO seeks to rebut this by citing his personal experience in flame wars, which manufactures two mistakes. Firstly, this is an anecdotal fallacy [1], in no way is PRO\\'s experience an accurate representation of the reality of flame wars on YouTube. Even if we disregard this, PRO has not proved how flame wars can be classified as a form of debate, as he/she personally admits, hence this argument is not relevant to the motion.D4) Rebuttal 3BPRO states that both sides of the house don\\'t have equal facilities, but leaves this point hanging and does not further this with any reasoning, thus this point is negligible. He/she has also stated that \"people rebut original points only\" and don\\'t take the initiative to conjure up points of their own. In reference to my previous argument, the specifications for winning a debate do not concern the originality of the arguments. Furthermore, doesn\\'t selectively rebutting points grant a free win for whoever is coming up with said \\'original arguments\\'? How does this correlate with PRO\\'s stance that it is actually harder for the person who has to come up with original arguments (assuming that originality even matters anyway)?D5) Rebuttal 4PRO responds to this by saying that Person A gets less opportunities to rebut and present arguments, and clarifies that this debate actually encompasses Internet debates and that my arguments are less effective under this premise. Under the framework of DDO debate, Person A and B both get the same amount of chances to rebut and present arguments, it is simply a matter of who gets the last say. This is also the case with other styles of debate such as World Schools Style and British Parliamentary. I personally would like to decline PRO\\'s modification of the term \\'debate\\' from formal and structured discussions like DDO to ones found on YouTube. Those are aptly named flame wars and not debates for a reason. As such, I do not wish to see my arguments invalidated just because PRO failed to fulfill his/her burden of clarifying what \\'debate\\' means in the acceptance round.D6) Rebuttal 5BThese points do not contradict each other if you have factored in another portion of my argument, which states that Person A has the advantage of sculpting the debate (i.e. the definitions, scope of debate, additional rules) which compensates for the fact Person A does not have the last say in a debate. Even if we discount this, PRO still has to prove that in ALL cases of a debate, the person who is the first to deliver an argument is NEVER the last one to speak in order to uphold this point, which is not true. In World Schools Style for example, the Proposition/Government (equivalent to PRO on DDO) starts off the debate with their first speaker, but is also the side that concludes the debate with their reply speaker [2].Rebuttals against PRO\\'s substantivesR1) Point 1This argument does not stand for two reasons:1. PRO\\'s argument is entirely based off of the functionings of DDO debate, but forgets that this motion does not only concern DDO debates but \\'debates\\' as a whole. Debates can occur in real life, and one is not given the option of cherrypicking which debates to participate in in real life debates. Once again, I am aware that PRO wishes to amend the purview of the term \\'debate\\' to mean online debates, but I do not approve of this amendment as aforementioned as defining terms should only be conducted in the first round.2. PRO acknowledges that there are cases where Person B cannot preselect which debates to take part in based on the content that Person A has posted in the first round by raising the example of Person A using the first round as an acceptance round. Bear in mind that the motion states that \"Debates are harder when you are the first one to come up with points\", which, unless per specific explication by PRO, means that PRO will have to justify that debates are ALWAYS more difficult for Person A. By providing the example of the acceptance round scenario, PRO has essentially disproved this him/herself.Even if both of these counterarguments do not stand, PRO\\'s argument is still insufficient in justifying his stance for the reason that Person A is given the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate his/her decision to instigate a debate in much the same way that Person B is given the opportunity to consider accepting a debate or not. More importantly, Person A is entitled to choosing what topic to debate on based on his/her strengths and weaknesses as well as preferences in the same way that Person B can choose which debates to engage in according to their proficiency of the matters discussed in the motion. Furthermore, both sides of the house are unaware of the ability of their opponents to-be as they most likely do not know their opponent in person given that the opponent\\'s profile information is true in the first place. Thus, all factors accounted for, it is not more difficult for Person A simply because Person B is able to decide which debates to participate in.ConclusionTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points and defended against all of PRO\\'s offenses against my case. I have argued that the conditions are the same as well as the burdens for both sides of the house and justified any inconsistencies between Person A and Person B, thus I have effectively proved that both sides are inherently equal to one another in terms of difficulty, and any further dissimilarities in difficulty can be traced back to the varying competencies between the two debaters.Thank you to PRO for such an interesting debate and all audience members and potential voters for your attention.

How easy it is for the opposition to pick out flaws in your argument is proportionate to how well you fabricate your arguments. So to speak, if you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don\\'t put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points. Furthermore, what PRO has not talked about is that picking on the opposition\\'s points and \"thinking hard for points to support your view\" is a shared burden for both sides of the house. Person B who \"can just read it and pick out the points\" is also obliged to come up with substantives to uphold his stance, and Person A in turn has the responsibility to rebut those points and establish new arguments, and this continues until the last round. As one can see, both sides of the house have the same onus and hence no side is harder than another in this respect. R2) \". .. people usually don\\'t use original points beyond the opening statement, at least in the Internet. \"Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis. Thus, we can only go as far as saying that this is an opinionated statement by PRO. Even if we assume this to be true, we don\\'t see how this creates a disparity between Person A and Person B. Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarise points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion. R3) *please refer to PRO\\'s additional argument at the top*I don\\'t really know what to make of this argument. PRO compares debating on DDO with debating in real life through talking about word limits and time constraints, but does not proceed to make the connection between such a comparison and the difficulty discrepancy between Person A and Person B. As far as DDO is concerned (assuming that this debate is oriented around online debates seeing that PRO talks about the Internet and \\'accepting challenges\\'), both sides of the house are subjected to the same time constraints and word limits, thus this argument is hollow in the scope of this debate. SUBSTANTIVESP1) Same burdens, same conditionsBoth sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within. In the most generic sense, each side of the house must successfully uphold their stance and rebut their opponent\\'s points/rebuttals against their points to win the debate. The specifications for victory are the same, and hence it is not intrinsically more difficult for one side of the house to take the debate. There are, however, some slight differences in terms of what Person A and Person B are required to do in order to meet these specifications. Person A, for instance, has to characterise the problem and justify that it is indeed an issue in the status quo. Some may argue that this gives Person A an advantage because they may shape the debate to be in their favour. To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the \\'last say\\', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round. This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A. CONCLUSIONTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points thus far and have demonstrated to you that a debate is structured in such a way that it allots the same context for each side of the house to debate within, and assigns the same goals for both sides to accomplish. A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B. Thank you and I await PRO\\'s response.', \"Words to Begin the Debate with First off, I apologize for forfeiting the round. I have had some issues with logging in that is now fortunately resolved[1]. I will have to point out that I am only at Grade 8, and have never encountered debates this formal. However, I will try my best to defend my point. Also, my points were targeted to the general internet, not specifically debate.org despite what I said. Sorry for the confusion. Rebuttals Rebuttal 1 “…no evidence that this makes the debate difficult for Person A.” While this might be true, I personally find it very difficult. This might be a personal thing though, and everyone has their opinions, especially over the internet, where lots of people, and naturally, lots of kinds of people are in. Rebuttal 2 “If you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don't put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points.” Again, while this might be true, isn’t debates all about convincing people to support either side? More points makes your arguments more convincing, and more valid rebuttals are also more convincing. According to debate.org’s 7 Point System (Source: http://www.debate.org...) “Who made more convincing arguments?” Is Worth the most marks (3). Therefore, even debate.org agrees that making arguments is important. While this might do nothing to support my point, I’d like to point that out. Rebuttal 3a “Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis.” I have participated in LOTS of flame wars on YouTube, and other sites. Almost None of them provide original points, or maybe just points that are overused, even insults. As a matter of fact, insults make up the most. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) There ARE differences between flame wars and proper debates, however, not everyone is as professional as you. Like me. Some debate like normal flame wars. Again, some. Not many, not all. Rebuttal 3b “Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarize points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion.” While that is true, I don’t think that they have completely equal facilities. However, this doesn’t matter. I have also pointed out that most people rebut original points only and doesn’t come up with any on the internet. Plus, they never cite any. Rebuttal 4 “Both sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within.” Please Refer to Rebuttal 3b. Plus, Person A gets one less chance to rebut to prove their point, especially since internet debates go on for infinite lengths, like 200 comments. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) Again, I apologize for the confusion, but my points were targeted to the general internet, which makes your points less effective. Rebuttal 5 “To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the 'last say', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round.” While this is very true in Debate.org, it’s not in the internet. Please do not let this point affect your rating towards Con though, It was my fault. Rebuttal 5b (1) “This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A.” (2) “A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B.” I personally think Point (1) and Point (2) Conflict. I think that the fact that you can’t rebut someone is very unfair, which adds to the unfairness of Person A. Person A loses 2 chances to rebut their Opponent, while Person B loses none. While I do understand that this is a counterargument, I have made more convincing ones in Middle School, that shows that the Counterarguments actually is a benefit, or is worth losing for. This is a debate on debates so I’d like to point that out. Arguments Point 0: Read me first If CON wants to, he can ignore the arguments, and pretend that I haven’t made any new arguments. As I had some account issues, I forfeited against my will, therefore I think it’s unfair to not let me make additional arguments. If CON disagrees however, he can ignore all my points. Point 0b: All my points I made in my Rebuttals Point 1: Everyone can see your arguments, and if they don’t know how to rebut them, they’ll skip While this might be untrue for those who uses Round 1 as an acceptance round, I personally don’t do so. I think it’s a waste rounds which is already not enough, especially since there is no time limit, or a time limit short enough to bother. If one is not confident on what they see on what Person A says, they’ll skip, and think their points thoroughly before coming back and accepting the challenge. If they fail todo so, they’ll simply ignore. If Person B’s arguments is so good they didn’t know what to say, they can’t withdraw, and will have to forfeit their rounds, which makes Person A seem bad, which ADDS to the unfairness. While the same might apply to Person B too, it does less. Plus, Person A doesn’t have an opportunity to pass, while Person B does. Conclusion While I might have not rebutted all points made by Con, I have rebutted most of them. A debate has many unfair places, especially for Person A. Points are shown to everybody before they accept them, Person B gets the final say. I’d like to apologize again for my misleading points. This time, My point targets specifically debate.org. However, that might have a chance to get ignored. -- NOTES -- [1] I do not have proof, so you'll have to trust what I say.

Well guess what? The one accepting the challenge can just read it and pick out the points you thought and debate on them. Then you debate their debate. Then it goes down that way.

Unfortunately ive only made minor progress.', '1) Too little time\"It can be done one country at a time, over a period of 100 or 200 years.\"Theres too many countries for that to be an option though.... Over half the countries in the world have to deal with extreme poverty, and if the US and wealthy nations were to focus one country at a time for 20 years like your original plan suggests, then it would only be able to help 5-10 countries. That still leaves a large chunk of the world without any form of aid while still financially criplling the wealthy nations2) The US and other countries don\\'t have enough money:\"If done over a long period of time the money needed shouldn\\'t overwhelm the nations doing the giving.\"Thats EXACTLY what will happen dingus... Youre proposing that wealthy nations dump hundreds of billions of dollars into poor countries every year for 100-200 years, its a fact that such a policy would financially cripple even the wealthiest of nations such as the US3) Dumping Billions into a country doesnt work\"We didn\\'t hire the Iraqis and Afghans to rebuild their infrastructure. Not as far as I know, anyway.\"Yeah we did, thats the only thing we\\'ve been doing in both of those countries for the last 8 years. http://www.defense.gov...http://www.nytimes.com...4) The US and wealthy nations cant just overtake poor countries and rebuild them\"So a nation doesn\\'t have a right to help another nation on its feet?\"Thats not what im saying idiot.... The argument was that the US and other nations cant actually control the money they are giving to the poor nation and that they have to simply trust it to the local government that runs the poor nation.... And that time and time again that has shown to be problematic since poor countries tend to have horrendously inefficient and corrupted governments that would completely screw up handling hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid a year.....5) Many Poor Countries Don\\'t Have a Lot of Farmland:\"With today\\'s technology, including fertilizers and stuff like that, I\\'m sure we could make that land arable.\"Dude you cant turn a desert into farmland, and even if you could Africa doesnt exactly have a bountiful supply of water to maintain such a farmhttp://thewaterproject.org...6) The Program Relies on Idiotic Assumptions:\" I think the program would work, if done properly.\"But it WONT be done properly because it never HAS been done properly..... Dumping trillions into a country to improve it has shown to not work at all, and youre ignoring that simply because you \\'think\\' that this time it will be different.', 'Reasons why this program wouldnt work in a million years:1) There are simply too many poor countries in the world to dump billions into. Pro\\'s program focuses entirely on Haiti at first, which has less than 0.15% of the global population, and then claims that if it will work in Haiti then it can work in the rest of the world.... The problem is though that the world consists of downtrodden countries that are WAAAAAAAAAY bigger and more populated than Haiti, and improving the wealth of those nations will dwarf the cost it takes to fix up a country as small as Haiti....... Countries like Zimbabwe, India, Somalia, Nigeria, Egypt, etc are all countries of much larger size and much bigger populations that any effort to eliminate extreme poverty in those nations would require trillions to fix over a couple of years.......2) The US and other wealthy nations arent that wealthyThe US isnt this vast source of wealth where it can dump trillions of dollars down the drain in trying to help every dirt poor country in the world become slightly less broke. The US already owes more money than any other nation in the world, and other nations in Europe arent much better off in terms of their debt either.... A proposal like this that calls for all the wealthiest nations to pour trillions into half of the nations in the world that struggle with extreme poverty would simply drive the wealthy nations that much further into debt, perhaps into outright bankruptcy, because those coutnries dont have that much money to burn on other nations. 3) It probably wouldnt even workIn the past ten years alone, the US has poured hundreds of billions, maybe even a couple trillion, dollars into Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in an effort to build up those countries and also to fight the war on terror...... Despite these TRILLION dollar interventions over the course of over a decade now, Iraq and Afghanistan are still two of the most failed nations in the world, and Pakistan is still towards the bottom of the list as well: http://en.wikipedia.org...Dumping trillions of dollars into a country that only averages a couple billion in GDP each year simply doesnt lead to explosive or even modest improvement over the years like your program suggests it would..... In fact the only reason why Iraq and Afghanistan have jumped a few spots is because other nations have gotten even poorer, not because theyve necessarily improved. If pouring TRILLIONS into Iraq and Afghanistan for 10 years didnt fix the poverty in those countries, then what in the hell makes you think that pouring billions into other countries for 20 years would have a better effect?4) The US and wealthy nations cant just walk around wherever they want and nation build as they please Despite nations like Haiti and Iraq being poor as hell, they still have governments which have sovereignty in trying to fix their nations. Any donation by the US and wealthy countries to fix up a country therefore goes to the governments that are already there trying to fix the problem, and if I know governments of crappy countries like I think I know them, then chances are they are going to completely blow that money on something else. Nations gripped with poverty correlate very well with nations that have super corrupted governments (Nigeria and North Korea for example). If you are going to dump billions into a country, then what you actually are doing is giving it to the governments in those nations and hoping that they dont misuse it, or even use it inefficiently..... And 10 out of 10 times they WILL screw something up and the money wont go where it is supposed to go. 5) A lot of poor countries dont have arable land. Youre entire program focuses on first setting up infrastructure and building farms..... Well thats a problem for countries that are almost entirely desert and dont have many areas to even build farms in the first place.... Libya, Chad, Algeria, Niger, Somalia, and Mali are all countries where only small percentages of land can be farmed at all. Mali is only listed at 5% of percentage of land that can be farmed, and many other countries arent much better offhttp://www.tradingeconomics.com...Your program focuses heavily on farming to build up the country, but in countries that dont have any land that can be farmed, this program is completely useless and doomed to fail. 6) The program operates on a lot of idiotic assumptions\"the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time\"There literally is no evidence suggesting this will happen at all..... This is just wishful thinking. If the only reason a country is growing is because of stupendous foreign aid, then everyone there will believe that they can only improve their country if they have lots of foreign aid coming in, which is the exact opposite of what you claim they will do. In addition to that, corrupted government officials will also look at foreign aid as the only way they can keep get massive sums of money for their country, which could easily cause them to drag their feet or delay efforts to improve the country just so that they can prolong how much money foreign nations keep giving them. ==================================================================================In summary: The program wont work, similar programs havent worked in the past, wealthy nations arent that wealthy, there are way too many poor nations in thw rodl to dump billions or trillions of dollars into, a lot of poor nations dont have that much arable land, and this is a really dumb program to advocate for.......', 'You appear to be halfway insulting me and halfway arguing your case. However, your points are all valid. Therefore, I concede victory to you.', \"1. Too many countries: It can be done one country at a time, over a period of 100 or 200 years. 2. The US and other countries don't have enough money: If done over a long period of time the money needed shouldn't overwhelm the nations doing the giving. 3. The US already tried that: What we did in Iraq and Afghanistan was send soldiers. We didn't hire the Iraqis and Afghans to rebuild their infrastructure. Not as far as I know, anyway. 4. We Have No Right To Do That: So a nation doesn't have a right to help another nation on its feet? 5. Many Poor Countries Don't Have a Lot of Farmland: With today's technology, including fertilizers and stuff like that, I'm sure we could make that land arable. 6. The Program Relies on Idiotic Assumptions: It seems like if they have their own businesses, and if opportunity abounds, the people will indeed learn to support themselves. And we wouldn't simply be giving them aid. We would have them build their own infrastructure, and we'd be paying them. They'd eventually learn to help themselves, even after the US lets go of the strings. Summary: I think the program would work, if done properly.\", \"The United States turns its attention to a poor nation like Haiti. Then.. The United States spends billions of dollars repairing their infrastructure and setting up useful farms. Here's the catch: they hire the locals to do all this work, on the payroll of the US Government. The workers would be paid in either food, money, or both. Farms will provide food for the nation, and the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time. After everyone has food to eat, other professions will be explored, such as office jobs. After twenty years or so the country will be much better off, and then the US can end its program and perhaps do the same thing in another country. I am well aware that this would probably not benefit the United States in any way, but it would be done in the name of eradication of poverty. If all the wealthier nations funded these programs, extreme poverty would be nearly extinct within 100 years. I await a response, from someone who's willing to debate this topic with me.\", '(See explanation in comments before reading.) Your argument in all of its forms is a proof by contradiction. First, I will address the original. I will only present the relevant lines in order to make it more readable: A - It is possible that a maximally great being exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it existed in only some possible worlds, it would not be maximally great, as it would be even greater to exist in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. What definition of great must we use to allow us to assert that it would be \"greater\" to exist in all possible worlds? Throughout the debate, I have proposed two: 1 - \"Powerful; posessing the ability to accomplish.\" 2 - “Of major significance or importance.\" You presented a third: 3 - \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" As you can see, the definition we use is crucial in determining the conclusion of your argument, or whether it even flows. If we use the first definition, your maximally great being is not a god, which was the conclusion of your argument, as indicated at the end of the first round. You did not object to this; you merely stated that my definition was inadequate. It is also quite obvious that if we use the second or third definition, statement B is false, as existing in all possible worlds does not make a being greater under those terms. In rounds 2 and 3, you avoid this by stating that you have provided properties that a maximally great being would have. This is entirely meaningless unless we define how we measure greatness. For example, under definition 3, a maximally great being need not have these qualities; it can be admirable AND useless. In round 5, you indicate that great can simulateously mean all of its definitions. For example, it can mean a combination of the above 3. This simply cannot be, for those definitions can interfere. Again, I propose that under definition 2, I am the greatest being. Under definition 1, obviously an omnipotent being would be maximally great. If I were omnipotent, this would be even greater than either of the other two, and thus an omnipotent me would be the maximally great being. If we prove the existence of a maximally great being using those 2 joint definitions, we have just proved the existence of an omnipotent me! This is why we must stick to one definition of the word per argument and/or prioritize them. You attempt to face my request for a definition of \"great\" for the first time in rounds 3 and 4 by posting a different version of the argument in which you avoid using that word: A - It is possible that a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and necissarily-existing exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it exists in some possible worlds, it exists in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. I will restate this point: \"Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid.\" Here are your objections to the gods I presented, which you list in round 5: \"...Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience.\" If we define \"Horrible\" as, \"Causing fear or dread or terror,\" a being which is omnipotent would certainly cause more fear than a limited being. You suggest that it would not need to be able to create a universe, but how horrible could it be if it were not able to create things which it could terrify and maim? Omniscience would also enhance the horribleness of the being. Thus, both of these qualities are musts for a maximally horrible being. You do make the claim that maximal horribleness contradicts omnipotence, but you do not back this up. Anticipating spectators\\' feelings toward this claim, note that this is only true in the case that maximal horribleness implies that some things are not logically possible, such as saving a kitten from a tree. The fact that the maximally horrible being is unwilling to help a kitten from a tree does not mean that it, in principle could not help a kitten from a tree. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that a being which could help the kitten and instead chooses not to is more horrible than a being which simply could not. \"There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate).\" I can easily conceive of necessarily-existent beings possessing these qualities. There need not exist things which the maximally irritating being can annoy. There also need not exist a being with which the maximally competitive being can compete. It would be within the power of each of these beings under their omnipotence to create things to irritate with which to compete. Similarly, as per your definition of a maximally great being, such a being would be omnibenevolent. There need not exist a field in which this being can do good works; it can create a field within which it can do good works Unless you want to concede that your argument structure is invalid, you must accept the existence of these beings. Fortunately, no one need accept their existence as the argument structure is demonstrably invalid via the use of another god. I conceived of this god in a rather absurd dream last night: the maximally detectable being. The maximally detectable being would have to be omnipotent to ensure circumstances under which it would be detected. The maximally detectable being would have to be omniscient to ensure it has knowledge of all states of the universe with which it manipulates circumstances via its omnipotence to maximize its detectability. The maximally detectable being is necessarily existing. And finally, the maximally detectable being ensures that the minds it creates would be aware of the presence of the maximally detectable being with 100% certainty. Assume your argument structure is valid. It is possible that a maximally detectable being exists. If your argument structure is valid, the maximally detectable being can be proven to exist using that structure. Therefore, the maximally detectable being must exist. If the maximally detectable being exists, you and I would detect it with 100% certainty. Neither you nor I have detected this being, therefore it does not exist. This proves either that one of your premises is false or that your argument structure is invalid. Some minor points from round 5: [1]: I need not give an argument for a claim I did not make. If you read what I wrote, I said nothing of brains. If an entity does not have a mind, it is not logically possible for it to do things which require a mind. You have not shown it to be the case that mindlessness contradicts omnipotence, because all of the things you claim are logically possible without a brain, which I do not deny, DO require a MIND. Again... the non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. [2]: Note that my statement was in response to another claim you made in round 4: \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" The rock is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to do anything today.\" The rock is simply not choosing to do anything as it cannot choose. The non-conscious entity is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to exercise my limitless power.\" It is simply not exercising its limitless power because it does not have the ability to do so. If it had that ability, it would contradict its mindlessness, which you never successfully proved to be impossible. [3]: I did concede the existence of a \"maximally great being.\" However, the existence of an utterly useless thing was not your conclusion. Although I conceded the existence of something with the same name as what you arguing for the existence of, it is not the same thing; I have not conceded the debate.', 'Thank you for finally expressing your position on the use of the word \"great.\" I do find it saddening that you have waited until round 4 to do so, but I hope that my points will become clear now that you have done this. You suggest that the argument proves the definition to which you appealed. This is true if and only if your definition allows your argument to be valid. For example, if I define a maximally great being as a being with the highest tolerance for spicy food, it does not logically follow that its existence in a possible world implies its existence in all possible worlds. Until you define the word \"great,\" it is unclear if your argument follows logically. You then present, again, another form of the argument which does not use the word \"great.\" I should first note that this is not the same argument that you were arguing for the validity of. Reminding the voters to keep this in mind, I shall do the extra work of dismantling it anyway: I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds. This is a possible world under your definition. Under your \"new\" definition of a maximally great being, premise 3 has thus been falsified. Furthermore, in philosophy, validity is determined by truth tables. Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid. I shall now define a few other gods: A maximally horrible being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, and omnimalevolent A maximally irritating being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, regularly intervenes in the universe to play practical jokes on people and confuse them, and has an inexplicable love of Miley Cyrus music. A maximally competitive being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent being and which has only one goal: to undo everything the maximally great being does. If the ontological argument were valid to prove the existence of any being you define, it is also valid to prove the existence of any being I define. Unless you concede the existence of those beings which I have defined, the argument structure is invalid. Fortunately, the existence of all of these things is negated by the falsity of premise 3 under their definitions. In response to extension 2, this is what I was countering when I first said that I conceded the existence of a maximally great being if and only if it allowed for the validity of the argument. Any maximally great being which would fit would not be considered God. If you propose to use the definition of a maximally great being that the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses, I then ask you to define \"excellence\" just as I asked you to define \"greatness,\" and for the same reason. I also bring forth the possible world which is inaccessible via other possible worlds and in which necessary existence is not a property. Thank you for providing a definition of the word \"great\" which allows your being to be omnibenevolent. Unfortunately, if this is what is meant by \"great,\" premise 3 of your argument is false. An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world. Your flaw resides in attempting to combine all definitions of the word \"great.\" This is the nature of the equivocation fallacy. A problem arises when we decide which definition will take priority. For example, if great means \"Powerful. Possessing the ability to accomplish,\" and \"of major significance or importance,\" one of two things is called into question: whether this maximally great being should be considered a god, or the validity of the argument. If the former takes priority, then the same problems I have presented before arise. If the latter takes priority, then I declare that I am greater than God. On the necessity of consciousness, note that I was careful in my wording. I suggested that a disembodied mind may not be logically possible. However, this appears to be distracting you from the main issue. My statement was that a maximally great being need not be conscious, depending on the definition of great. If this being does not have a mind, then it cannot think, reason, etc. However these are things which are logically impossible to do without a mind. There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. Extension 3 is but a reiteration of this point. I have already addressed this. \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" This does not follow. A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to. This does not entail an ability to choose. It is possible that the thing simply cannot choose due to a logical impossibility to do so. Remember that omnipotence is not necessarily useful. In response to your final statements, if the word \"great\" was not required in the beginning, then you should not have used it in your definition. This was a flaw in your own planning. Definitions are best kept specific and exclusive. Your original definition was neither. I will, for the last time, suggest that you present a definition of the word \"great\" so that your original argument can be valid and your maximally great being will retain the status of \"god.\" You may want to present another argument, but this is not relevant to the validity of your original argument, which you were arguing for. Furthermore, based on my past experience, your original argument is the one which will be the easiest to defend due to its vagueness. It is my recommendation that you focus your next round on it instead. I await your decision.', 'Thank you for attempting to clarify this for me. I have indeed understood the argument, and I have spent the past two rounds explaining to you how crucial it is that you define the term \"great.\" Unfortunately, you have still neglected to establish a definition. This is of prime importance in determining either the truth of your premises or the validity of your argument. Please choose a definition for great which can be used to describe God in the way that you desire and also allows your argument to retain its validity. Your other option is to be guilty of an equivocation fallacy. I requested in round 1 that you do this in round 2. I am now asking that you do this in round 4. You have indeed defined a maximally great being... however, you have done so quite poorly. To provide this definition, you have used a word which does not have a certain definition. If we don\\'t know what \"great\" means, how are we supposed to know if a maximally \"great\" being is comparable to God? Again, I provide the example in which \"great\" means “of major significance or importance.\" In this case, I am greater than God, as I am much more important to myself as I do not believe in God. Am I God? Of course not. I implore you; for the sake of the validity of your argument, provide a definition for the word \"great.\" It\\'s quite impossible for me to continue until you provide me with a sufficient definition. I have already shown your definition of a maximally great being to be faulty under my definition of \"great,\" and you have not contested it under this definition. Extend all arguments until pro provides a valid definition. As for your refutation of my claims about existence... I should warn you not to become too distracted with this. This was after all only a suggestion as to what this maximally great being could be; it is not necessary for me to provide this in order to show your claim for the existence of God to be false. All the same, as I have about 6000 characters left, I shall defend it. At no point did I suggest that existence is a property. I am well aware of the proof of which you speak; however, I suggested existence as an entity, not a property. Existence may not be a predicate, but it certainly can be a subject. Furthermore, in the case of existence itself, a consciousness may not be logically possible as there would be no physical thing to be responsible for this consciousness. Thus, its omnipotence remains intact. You accuse me of imporperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence.', '“Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true.” Unfortunately, your conclusion was not “There is a maximally great being,” but “There is a God,” which you indicate in the final line of the first round. There is indeed a maximally great being; you have no disagreement from me on that count. My disagreement is in that this maximally great being is God or even A god. This statement also encompasses the claim you make in your final paragraph of round 2. “Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\"” Unfortunately, without establishing a definition of the word “great,” you are potentially guilty of an equivocation fallacy. Allow me to explain: If we take the word “great” to mean “of major significance or importance,” then your maximally great being is not omnipotent, omniscience, or omnibenevolent. In fact, I declare that a maximally great being would instead be myself. I am much more important to me than an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being, because I do not believe such a being exists. Therefore, I can think of a “greater” being than the greatest conceivable being. It is clear you do not accept the definition of “great” to be “Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish.” I suggest you attempt to establish an alternative definition in the next round to avoid the aforementioned fallacy. You suggest that “[your] definition” is superior at the end of the paragraph I have just referenced. I ask: did you mean the definition of a maximally great being? If this is the case, then I will simply state that your definition can be less restrictive and accomplish the same goal, and is thus, inferior. Indeed, one component is potentially contradictory (provided that you do not sufficiently defend it), which, if shown to be the case, would entirely nullify the usefulness of your definition. Did you mean the definition of “great,” and “greatness”? If this is the case, then I again suggest you attempt to establish these definitions in the next round. I will extend my argument against omniscience as your rebuttal is based upon a disagreement on the meaning of the word “great.” Until you establish an alternative definition, the argument stands. “An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being.” A being need not be benevolent to establish a moral law, should one exist. In fact, an omnipotent, omnimalevolent being would have to establish a moral law in order to defy it. You claim that to be good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Indeed, we may prefer a being which is all-good, but if the definition of “greatness” is not established to have a meaning that encompasses morality, this claim holds no weight. Therefore, I again claim that a neutral being would be greater than either as it would have no restriction upon its actions. “Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things.” Indeed, existence is responsible for all logically possible things. If existence did not itself exist, then there would not exist anything, including the concepts of those things which are logically possible. By itself existing, existence has put into place all that exists, and an alteration in existence itself could put into existence anything which could possibly exist. “But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence.” Again, this disagreement takes place based on your disagreement with my definition of “great.” I will take this opportunity to put further weight on the irrelevance of omniscience until an alternative definition is given.', 'As a disclaimer, I agree that the ontological argument is a sound argument for a maximally great being. What I will be showing to be faulty is your definition of a maximally great being, and therefore your suggestion that this maximally great being is God. This will become clear in a moment. For the purpose of this argument, I put forth the following as suggestions for definitions of “great” and “greatness”: Great – Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish. Greatness – A measure of a thing’s ability to accomplish. For this round, I will be operating under these definitions. If you do not agree with these or wish to put forth alternative definitions, please do so in the next round. It is your assertion that a maximally great being would be omniscient. I claim that omniscience is irrelevant to a being’s greatness. Indeed, it is my claim that consciousness is not a quality required of a maximally great being. A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be. Our human perception suggests that having a mind makes things “better,” but this does not make something more able to accomplish. If a maximally great being were instead a pre-planned set of events dependent upon circumstances, it would not change that being’s ability to set those events into motion. It is also your assertion that a maximally great being would be omnibenevolent. Even if we establish that such a being had a consciousness, it is not required that it do good works. Again, certainly we humans would prefer that it were benevolent. However, an omnibenevolent being is in fact limited in that it cannot perform evil tasks. I propose that a neutral being is in fact greater than either an omnibenevolent or omnimalevolent being as it can freely perform either good or evil tasks, if we were to even establish that such things existed. What we are left with is a being which is omnipotent (that is, it can accomplish anything), and exists in every logically possible world. Existence itself is omnipotent (If it exists in a possible world, then it has been accomplished under the power of existence itself. Not even God is claimed to be able to make logically incoherent things exist.) and must exist in every logically possible world, as for it to be otherwise is a contradiction. Existence itself is a maximally great being. If you wish to worship a non-conscious entity which would as soon destroy you as create you, you are free to do so. However, it is my contention that this is no God at all, but merely a feature of reality.', 'This is a terrible parody. The reason why a MGB under the definition I presented applies to all possible worlds is because a property of a MGB as defined is that the explanation for its existence, if it actually exists, is necessary rather than contingent existence. If you define a MGB as one that is most \"tolerable\" of spicy food then the premises would not follow from this definition. So by using this example, which is fallacious, and comparing it to the definition I gave, which does lead into the conclusion, you have proven that the definition to which I have appealed is sound. Necessary existence is existence in every logically possible world. Necessity is a property, existence is not. Then, FINALLY, you attempt to deny a premise of the actual argument. The arguments without the word \"great\" in them are NOT different arguments. They are the same exact arguments I gave in the first post. What you have not refuted is that the word \"great\" is meaningless since the argument functions by replacing it with \"God\" and O^3NE the same exact way. Thus, definitions like the ones you gave do not matter when determining the soundess of the argument. \"I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds\" This shows your ignorance of the modal realm. In no possible world can necessity not be a property. This is true because anything that exists has an explanation of its existence. These explanations are of two sorts: (1) they exist by a necessity of their own nature or (2) they exist by an external cause (contingency). The property of necessity exists in every possible world. These are the two explanations of being. I will address your parodies by addressing the first. My objections will apply to all of them: On Maximal Horribleness: This is bad. \"Maximally Horrible Being\" just is to say that there exists a being that is omnimalevolent (this is what it means to be maximally horrible). But, Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience. Thus, it is impossible for this being to have these properties as well as necessity since \"Maximal Horribleness\" only entails one of the properties you described: omnimalevolence. On the contrary, a MGB as defined as a \"being than which none greater can be conceived (I stated this in round two)\" necessarily must have omnipotence etc. since if it did not, one could conceive of a greater being. But a \"maximally horrible being\" does not have the same application since I can conceive of a Maximally Horrible Being not being omnipotent; that is, I can conceive of a being that is about to inflict horror, but this does not mean that it must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible (omnipotence). In order to be a Maximally Horrible Being it does not need to be able to create the universe for example. So the argument fails because it actually contradicts omnipotence. Let me just say a word about irritating and competitive: these things are illogical. There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate). This, it is CONTINGENT on the existence of other things. Hence not necessary. Hence not applicable. So you have not given a successful parody. You then ask to defined Maximal Excellence in the Stanford definition. Ironically, they did that for you, once again. Maximal excellence is an entity which possesses: \"omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.\" What makes it MG is that it is necessary. \"An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world.\" But it could not be restricted to one possible world. It is a contradiction to say a necessary being (exists in all possible worlds) is \"restricted to one possible world.\" \"There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact.\" This is hopelessly fallacious. You claim that minds cannot exist without brains. You have made an assertion, you have not given an argument. So I will attempt to anticipate since this is my last chance: all arguments for substance materialism are that we know of no minds that do not depend on the brain. Notice how this is specific to our experience and to homo sapiens. There are no logical inferences that allow one to say that because humans don\\'t have embodied minds, that therefore they are impossible. You have to show that the concept is like a round square, and clearly it is not. Additionally, you are ONCE AGAIN, equivocating on omnipotence: Your claim is that an omnipotent being exists but it cannot be called God since it is not conscious. This is a contradiction. By definition omnipotence is a being\\'s ability to do all things that are logically possible. But we know that consciousness is logically possible. Which means your being is not omnipotent since it does not have consciousness. Which means omnipotence is reliant on consciousness. An unconscious all powerful things cannot have consciousness hence not making it all powerful. You lose here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" This is just ABSURD. You beg the question here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" A rock cannot choose! Thus my argument still stands: an omnipotent being must be conscious since by definition it must be able to choose but choice is only possible with consciousness. REASONS TO VOTE FOR ME: 1.Definitions DO NOT matter in terms of taking one word out of MGB an defining it. Remember that I defined such a being as being omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent in every possible world AND as \"a being than which none greater can be conceived.\" My opponent has tried to refute it by saying \"great\" can mean different things. This does not matter since the argument proves the definition I gave as a collective thing: MGB. Moreover, the word \"great\" is not needed in the argument: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists This is the same exact argument as I originally offered. It proves the existence of the same exact being. The argument stands. 2.I proved that the use of individual definitions, which is what he is doing, is fallacious. He has yet to respond to this: \"A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics.\" 3.My opponent CONCEDED that a MGB exists. He just said it is not \"conscious,\" but that it is omnipotent. This is the reason you should vote for me: he concedes an omnipotent being exists, but an omnipotent being MUST BE CONCIOUSS because if it is not then that necessarily means it cannot do something that can logically be done: perceive, think, choose etc. So my opponent tacitly concedes the entire debate.', 'I am sorry. You are not answering the argument. The argument does not rely on the individual definition of its parts. The definition of a MGB as defined by Alvin Plantinga, who developed this argument, is as was defined by me in round one. You are quibbling about nothing Extension One: Everyone can extend the argument I made in the first rebuttal about how his definitions game was irrelevant. The argument does not rely on the definition of particular words. Rather, the argument proves the definition to which I appealed. I demonstrated this in the following way, an argument to which he did not respond: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists See, using \"MGB\" is not needed; its just three words used to defined a being with the properties mentioned above. The argument functions the same and proves that a being with O^3NE exists. The conclusion follows unless he attacks one of the premises, which he has yet to do. Extension Two: I also proved the above argument by showing that using specifically \"MGB\" is necessary if I simply replace it with \"GOD.\" God is defined as an omnipotent, all knowing all good and necessary being. Now, working under this definition, the argument still works into the conclusion, PROVING THAT INDIVIDUAL DEFINITIONS ARE IRRELEVANT: 1. It is possible that God (as defined) exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ....The rest follows. Moreover, the use of individual definitions, I argued, is misleading. There are dozens of definitions of the word \"great.\" None of the encompass the philosophy of religion since, a common dictionary is not a good reference when having discussions like these. First I will offer a collective definition of a MGB from an authority (since I seem to be inadequate) and then use individual definitions to do the exact same ridiculous things hes doing to undermine his positions: From Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"The \"victorious\" modal ontological argument of Plantinga (1974) goes roughly as follows: Say that an entity possesses \"maximal excellence\" if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Say, further, that an entity possesses \"maximal greatness\" if and only if it possesses maximal excellence in every possible world—that is, if and only if it is necessarily existent and necessarily maximally excellent.\" It matters not individual definitions, but the collective definition since no matter what you call it, the argument proves that an All knowing, all good, all powerful and necessary being exists. Call it a MGB or not. Call it a sandwich (this would be equivocating but if you define \"sandwich\" as having these properties, then the argument STILL works and it proves a God in whom you do not believe) But now I will employ reductio ad absurdum to show how your use of definitions is pointless. OMNIBENEVOLENCE: A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics. You make an unwarranted assertion and finally attack the idea of being all-knowing as \"may not be logically possible.\" That\\'s nice, can you provide an argument? There is no explicit logical incoherence of an unembodied mind; there is therefore a possible world in which these things could exist. They are metaphysically possible. I do not even need to defend dualism-interactionism because you make a devastating concession. Namely, you concede that a MGB exists, but it only has the property of omnipotence. Extension 3: This is devastating. You have not responded to the fact that you are equivocating. Omnipotence means, for the third time, the ability to do all things that are logically possible. If this being is omnipotent and does not have the property of consciousness, and by extension, the ability to think, feel, act in purpose etc., then there are logically possible things it cannot do. Hence, not omnipotent. But you conceded it was omnipotent. Therefore, it follows necessarily that it does have a mind not bound by physicality. You object: You accuse me of improperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence. This is demonstrably fallacious: Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose. Sure God does not need to do something, but in order for Him to be omnipotent, He must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible. If something cannot think, reason, etc. the fact that it does not do this is irrelevant insofar as it cannot do these things, hence it not being omnipotent. Again, equivocation. For the sake of everybody else, I cannot stress how irrelevant his points are to the truth of the argument. You may disagree with the argument, but we can all agree, through the laws of logic and deduction, that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. And he has yet to respond to a single premise. Once again, his entire argument rests on the word \"great,\" having one of many definitions. I will repost: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists Notice here how \"great\" or MGB is nowhere in the argument. Why? Because it is NOT needed, \"great\" and \"MGB\" are not necessary for the argument.', 'I think you are not understanding the argument: I claimed that the definition, on which the Ontological argument relies, of a Maximally Great Being is a being who has the properties of omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, and existence in every possible world. Now, based on that definition of a MGB, the argument in terms of the syllogism proves that such a being exists. 1. It is possible that a MGB exists (MGB is the definition I gave) If this premise is true, then the rest follows. The argument proves the definition I gave, so in order for you to deny the existence of such a being, you have got to refute one of the premises. Insofar as you have yet to refute any of them, the conclusion follows with necessity. Your use of definitions is dubious and irrelevant. Even if I grant that your definitions of individual words is applicable, all I have to do is change the phrase \"MGB\" to God. Then the argument still follows so the semantics game is irrelevant: God is the greatest conceivable being. As the greatest conceivable being He would be omnipotent, omniscient and necessary in every possible world. 1. It is possible that God exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ... and the rest follows. So your quibbling about the semantics of the individual words of MGB is irrelevant since the conclusion still follows. The entire argument can be extended because the argument, regardless of your definitions, proves that a being that I HAVE DEFINED exists. So in order to win, you have got to reject a specific premise otherwise there is an indictment to which you may have to be subjected: irrationality. The conclusion follows with necessity if the premises are true, and you have yet to refute one of them. is sorry, you are incorrect. The conclusion of the syllogism, which is the argument, is \"Therefore, a MGB (as in, a being that is all powerful, all knowing, all good in every possible world) exists.\" Like I said, MGB in the syllogism is the same as saying \"It is possible that an all knowing, all good, all powerful, and necessary being exists in every possible world.\" MGB is simply to name a being who has all of those properties. I am not equivocating since I established a definition of an entire concept: maximal greatness. The argument functions under the definition I gave in argument one which you have yet to respond. You cannot simply define a word within a concept. The concept is defined as a whole. Remember, the argument functions independent of individual definitions, the argument (as in the syllogism) proves the MGB that I defined, so your quibbling is irrelevant. My argument is NOT based on a disagreement of the definitions you offered. I am sure that generically, that is what those words mean. But I have defined the concept of a maximally great being as a being than which no greater being can be conceived; the greatest conceivable being. The argument, which you have yet to respond, proves THIS definition, which means your arguments are irrelevant. I cannot stress this enough because the argument functions on the definition I provided. This is common knowledge if you look up the literature on the modal ontological argument. My argument from omniscience goes unrefuted. The fact is you CONCEDED omnipotence as a property of a MGB. You contradict yourself completely by saying that a MGB does not have the properties of knowledge, reason, all-knowingness etc. because that means there are things which a MGB cannot do/experience which contradicts omnipotence. Implication: you are equivocating in terms of omnipotence since this means to have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible, which includes being all-knowing. On omnibenvolence: look, even if such a being does not have to be benevolent, this is absolutely irrelevant. The reason is because the argument proves that a being with this property actually exists. Even if it does not have to have this property, so what? The argument proves that it does with the conclusion. \"Therefore, a MGB (as I have defined it) exists.\" On existence: it is paradoxical that you should make this argument. The obsolete version of the Ontological Argument developed by Anselm of Cantebury in 1033 A.D. made the same mistake by considering existence to be a property. Immanuel Kant did away with this argument by proving that existence is not a predicate or a property. This is absurd. Look it up, this has been sufficiently refuted. Moreover, your claim that existence alone is omnipotent is false and is equivocation. Omnipotent, again, means the ability to do that which is logically possible. But an abstract concept that you offer does not have the ability to think, experience personhood, etc. So you are not using the word properly. I think it is clear that the argument stands. To get away from the definition debate, here is why I win: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists You have already conceded that the logic with which the argument functions is sound. So the conclusion follows from the premises and I have successfully circumvented your use of individual definitions to prove that a being, as I have defined it, actually exists. Hence, the Ontological Argument is sound As Bertrand Russell remarked \"Great God in boots! The Ontological Argument is sound!\"', 'Thank you for the debate. Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true. Notice how the definition I offered of a MGB is not part of the argument in terms of the deductive syllogism. This is because the syllogism, if the premises are true, prove the definition of a MGB to which I appealed. That is, if the argument is true then the definition of a MGB I offered is exemplified in a being that actually exists. If you accept that \"it is possible that a MGB exists\" as in MGB that I defined, then everything follows. So you have not shown how my definition is incoherent. But, naturally, your arguments are vacuous. Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\" As I said, taken together, a MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be conceived.\" If you can think of a greater being, then that would be the MGB. Thus, if the properties of this being to which I have appealed are properties that a MGB should have as a being than which none greater can be conceived, then it follows that my definition is superior. Omniscience: Your argument is demonstrably fallacious. You say: \"A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be.\" This is false. You already concede that a MGB would have omnipotence. But if a MGB has omnipotence, then it would have to have consciousness. For if it could not experience the ability to perceive and reason and think, then it not only is not a MGB but it is also not omnipotent because there is something that is logically possible that it cannot do; namely, the property of having consciousness. Moreover, if it does not have the ability to be all-knowing then it is not truly a MGB since we can plausibly conceive of a being that is greater; one who does have the property of maximal intelligence and knowledge. So your claim that a MGB is fallacious because by definition, the most perfect conceivable being would have the properties of knowing and reason and consciousness. These things are better to have than not to have, otherwise it is blind about without purpose. An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being. By the very nature of maximal greatness, the nature of such a being would entail the property of being all-good, for to be all good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things. But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence. Your view renders this abstraction as a thing that cannot do a multiplicity of things that we would consider a MGB to be able to do. Thus, you completely undermine the definition of omnipotence because your view means there are plausibly things that cannot be done by this being. It is important to note, however, that I win even if everything above is false. You have simply pointed out that a MGB does not have to have certain properties. But you did not show that having those properties is logically incoherent. Since you did not prove that it is logically incoherent, then that means the argument\\'s conclusion follows and therefore a MGB under my definition exists. Since the argument is based on the definition I gave, and the definition I gave is logically possible, then the conclusion is inescapable based on the laws of deduction. Since it is possible that a MGB as defined by me in post 1 is possibly exemplified in a world, then it follows that such a being does exist, even if you are correct and a MGB does not have to have those properties. My argument shows that it does. By the way, references include Alvin Plantinga who developed this modal form.', 'Framework: In order to show that the Ontological Argument is not sound, the CON must show that one of the premises of the argument is untrue. If all of the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion follows with necessity as it is a deductive argument. Observation One: \\'Possible Worlds\\' are descriptions of reality. They are ways the world could have been but is not actually. For example, fairies do not actually exist, but there is some possible world in which fairies do exist. If something is possible, then it exists in some possible world. Observation Two: A Maximally Great Being (MGB) is a being that is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent and that exists in every logically possible world (necessary existence). Since an MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be concieved,\" it must have the property of necessity since to exist in only some possible worlds would not be maximally great, that is, one can conceive of a greater being; namely one that exists in every world. Observation Three: To say something is possible, that is, something that is logically coherent, is the same as saying that there is some possible world in which this thing does exist. To say that a thing exists in every possible world is to say that that thing exists in the actual world, since out world is a possible world. To say that something, of which the property of necessity is exemplified, exists in some possible world, is the same as saying that it exists in every possible world because to necessarily exist means to exist in every possible world. The Argument: Premise (1): It is possible that a MGB exists Premise (2): If it is possible that a MGB exists, then a MGB exists in some possible world Premise (3): If a MGB exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world Premise (4): If a MGB exists in every possible world, it exists in the actual world Premise (5): If a MGB exists in the actual world, then a MGB exists Conclusion (6): Therefore, a MGB exists in the actual world Conclusion (7): Therefore, a MGB exists Premises 2-7 are uncontroversial. The modal logic with which the argument functions is very well established and both atheistic and theistic philosophers would agree. Thus, the whole argument rests on whether or not the existence of a MGB is possible. Justification for Premise 1: There are two types of possibilities: Metaphysical Possibility and Epistemic Possibility. The former represents things that are actually possible because their properties are not logically incoherent, or there are no logical contradictions. For example, a round square is metaphysically impossible because it is logically incoherent. Having a coin in your pocket is metaphysically possible since there is no logical incoherence about that event. Epistemic possibility is \"for all we know, X is true.\" It is the same as being presented with a difficult math equation and seeing the solution. For all you know it may be true or false. An example would be the coin: For all I know you could have a coin in your pocket. Metaphysical possibility deals with actual possibility, those things which could actually exist because their properties are not logically incoherent. Therefore, if something is logically coherent, then it is metaphysically possible. So, is the concept of a MGB coherent? Well, there seems to be no contradiction within the definition I gave; no incoherence. It seems perfectly plausible that the properties within the definition are logically consistent. Thus, if the definition on which the argument relies is coherent, then it follows that Premise 1 is true and therefore the argument is true. In order for the CON to disprove 1, the concept of a MGB needs to be proven incoherent; like a round square. No such contradiction seems to be evident. Thus, if you think God\\'s existence is even possible, then it follows that God exists. And we therefore have a priori proof for the existence of a MGB, AKA God.', 'Thanks for your attemopt and yeah you have a good point but i can deal with. I thought of this idea because of the nature of the debate or vote. When you have a debate with someone and there is no time limit for the voting period, it does not make sense because in that case there will not be a clear winner and and you will have to check all the time and at the end, you just give up. your point about the number limit of voters, i just believe if we can just say that the debate will be decided by the forst 20 or 30 numbers of voters or even ten but the problem with that sometimes is if you dont have that number of people voting,you can then decide on who has most people in the voting period. when you say that you have for instance 10 liberal coming first and vote and conservative sometimes coming late, the decision will not be fair. I believe that people should not vote based on their own feelings or opinions. the vote should be based on the arguments made by the debaters and who has better ones. that is how i vote and i believe that is how a debate should be decided. If it is already possible to forfeit a round because somebody could not make it in a frame of time, why not limit the voting period too or numbers of voters. this can be decided by the debaters before starting a debate. You should also know that no all people will vote for each debate. people usually read debate they are interested in and then vote. so even if there is no time limit, lots of people still might not vote. Thanks and have a nice day', 'I know most people here including myself are here to learn and dont really mind losing or winning a debate. Instead I wanna learn from others. I just think that during the voting period, we should have a limited numbers of voters or days to decide the winner and the loser. This will make the whole debating thing exciting... because right now it is not limited and you must keep checking all the time to know if there is any change. Thanks', \"I will make an attempt to win this although it is set up extremely lopsided, towards the Pro. Because the website updates the statistics on your w/l record, it is not necessary for them to stop the voting at a certain time, so as to tally the results. By limiting the number of voters, you limit the selection of voters, so, if 10 liberals get to a conservative topic before the conservatives, and there are only 10 votes allowed, it would be unfair to the conservative debater. Also, because there are so few members on the site, and so few actively voting, by limiting the voting time, you limit the number of votes, which I have already stated is not a good thing, some people aren't on here 24/7 but may still want to vote, but if the voting period is up before they get to the topic they can't.\", \"Since you have mainly based your argument on the fact that you want to see who wins or loses, I will go over that first. First of all, the w/l record is constantly updated, so you don't have to go back and look to see if you won or lost constantly, secondly it is not that hard to go to your profile, and look through each of your debates and look at the two numbers above the names. If you are willing to put forth the effort to debate a topic, you should be able to click a few times and read some numbers. You also haven't taken into consideration all the people who cannot be on the website everyday, and will miss out on voting, and each debate needs as many votes as possible, to keep any biases from affecting it, it is just like when the media takes a poll, if they don't poll a wide variety of people, they often end up wrong, for example, the Chicago Tribune stating that Dewey beat Truman in the presidential election... if we only allow a small amount of voters, we may end up with biased votes, especially in very controversial topic such as religion. Also, since the site is still growing, by limiting the time for which a debate can be voted on, we disallow future members from voting on certain topics, and as I have stated, you need a wide variety, and large amount of voters to be accurate. I believe that it is more important for the debate voting to be accurate, than for the debaters to be able to check the win or loss easily, and that there are better options for checking the win loss, if it is in fact really necessary.\", 'Wouldn\"t you feel better about yourself if you knew you could help thousands of people? I hope so. Now there\"s cloning going on. I know some of you guys are thinking \"Like in books and movies?!\" My answer to that is no. You know what cloning is. And if you don\"t cloning is when a cell, cell product, or organism is genetically identical to the unit or individual from which it was derived. Cloning is important because if you\"re in a accident and you lose one of your limbs or organs or a body part, with therapeutic cloning you may be able to get it back. If you\"re a victim of heart attack, cloning can help by cloning healthy heart cells and putting it in damaged areas of the heart. Infertile couples can now have kids with cloning. Cloning can help people with disabilities. I strongly believe that cloning should not be banned.', 'This is our last time to argue. I hope you think that cloning is good now. There aren\"t many cons on cloning. All you can really do with the cons are write more details about them in depth. But for pros there are many. I will happily list some of them.\" Cloning might produce a greater understanding of the cause of miscarriages, which might lead to a treatment to prevent spontaneous abortions. This would help women who can\\'t bring a fetus to term. It might lead to an understanding of the way a morula (mass of cells developed from a blastula) attaches itself to the uterine wall. This might generate new and successful contraceptives.\" I got that quote from \"The Cloning Debate: Pro Views.\" ThinkQuest. Oracle Foundation, n.d. Web. 10 Mar. 2014.\" What this quote says is that cloning can help woman who can\"t produce a child. Here is another quote. \"Easy replacement of internal organs and tissues for patients in need of transplants instead of waiting for suitable organ donors, alive or dead. Since the transplanted organ contains most of the recipient\"s genes, there is a lesser chance for rejection as well. Cloning can be a solution to the infertility issue among couples. Theoretically speaking, parents can choose the desirable qualities in their genes to be passed on to their children. Genetic research can immensely benefit from cloning especially in combating the wide range of genetic diseases.\" This information was from \"Surfcrs. \"Organ Cloning.\" Organ Cloning RSS. Organ Cloning, 19 Jan. 2011. Web. 08 Mar. 2014.\" This quote has 3 pros. 1.There is easy replacement of organs. 2.Cloning is a solution to infertile couples. 3. Research with cloning can help understand diseases. I keep saying this in my paragraphs but cloning can help people with disabilities or people with diseases. If someone in your family had cancer and they thought that with cloning they might discover a cure. Wouldn\\'t\"t you be all for it? Cloning is such a useful thing for so many people. I still stand for Pro on cloning. Thank you for reading this.', 'Cloning is only bad if you make it bad. You see, Cloning can help million and thousands of people. People with disabilities can be helped. I myself do not agree with making a race of perfect individuals. I feel like that is wrong. You are only looking at the negatives of cloning. I only wrote negatives in that paragraph to show others what the negatives can be. So if they later on they found out, they wouldn\\'t\"t blame me for not telling them in my paragraph. If people use cloning in such a way, I will strongly disagree with their wrong-doings. Some woman don\"t feel like cloning is good because they need to donate one egg cell. The thing is, Us women have a lot of egg cells to spare. Will it really hurt us if we donate one egg cell? And for your comment of \"They think that when using an unfertilized egg for any type of cloning you are killing a possible human, a possible child. \" Wouldn\\'t\"t you think it better for a person to not have lived in the first place, or be killed later on? what if you got an a accident and lost the power to move your leg? And the doctors say \" There is a possibility to gain power of your foot once more. But you would need therapeutic cloning.\" Would your answer be no? Would you really believe so strongly that cloning is that bad that you wouldn\\'t\"t try to save yourself in any way?', 'The risks/cons for cloning are that there is a possibility of faster aging. This is because you are using an older cell to clone. Another risk is that it may reduce the overall value of human life. If you didn\"t like your first child, you can try to make the perfect child with cloning. Another con is that there is a reduced sense of individuality. Cloning makes us seem all the same. I got this information from \"Pros and Cons of Human Cloning.\" HealthRF. Health Research Funding.Org, 6 Dec. 2013. Web. 25 Feb. 2014.\" I posted benefits of cloning in my introduction. I got that information from \"Smith, Simon. \"The Benefits of Human Cloning.\" The Benefits of Human Cloning. Human Cloning Foundation, 26 Feb. 1998. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.\" Ethical issues with cloning are that \"religious organizations. They all strongly oppose cloning as according to the religious belief life begins at conception and that life cannot be created artificially but from the unity of a man and female. At the same time, the church together with the other religious organizations argue against therapeutic cloning as well because, as mentioned above, they are guided by the idea that life starts at the conception and once the embryo exists it must be treated as a person, and thus destroying embryos and using them only for the purpose of research is not consistent with the religious view on the issue.\" That was a quote from \"Cloning- Ethical Issues.\" Ethical Issues Of Cloning. Bioarts.Com. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.\" People think that life begins at the stage of an egg cell. Because of this , they think that by using an egg cell that we are killing a human being.', 'There aren\"t many cons to cloning? How about premature death, high rate of miscarriage, moral issues, very low success rate, and loss of individuality? It seems to me that there are quite a few. I can\"t see how you think cloning is a solution for infertile couples. The only couples that would be able to afford it would be the rich and famous. Even if a couple did find enough money, the success rate is simply not high enough to guarantee they leave with a child. \"For a recent paper on cloning in Science, Peter Mombaerts Peter Mombaerts , a scientist at Rockefeller University in New York City who clones mice, ran through 4,000 mouse oocytes\"he estimates that might be $2,000 worth of mice. Doing the same work in humans, he estimates, could cost $2 million. Scientists will almost certainly use fewer eggs if therapeutic cloning is used on people. But even if it required a mere 100 eggs, taken from ten donors, the cost of simply paying the donors could easily reach $50,000. On top of that, there would be medical costs involved in procuring the egg. Mombaerts believes it could cost more than $1,000 per egg when all is said and done. That means costs to treat one patient could conceivably soar above $100,000.\" This is according to \"Cloning\\'s High Cost.\" Forbes. Forbes Magazine. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. How many average American citizens do you think actually have the money to pay for something like that? The median income was $51,017 a year, says Hargreaves, Steve. \"Poverty Rate 15%, Median Income $51,017.\" CNNMoney. Cable News Network, 17 Sept. 2013. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. That is barely over half the cost of therapeutic cloning. The way I see it, cloning is highly impractical. Seeing as the cost is high, and the success rate low, very few can afford it. Along with reducing the value of life, cloning shortens the lifespan of the cloned organism. On top of all that, by continuing with cloning we are one step closer to a dystopian-like society where non-clones are frowned upon, and individuality is a crime. I believe cloning will do more harm than good, and this is why I have, and always will, support the con side.', \"In my opinion, the cons of cloning outweigh the pros. So many things can go wrong, and so many eggs are needed to produce a clone, that you have to ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Personally, I would not want therapeutic cloning. I wouldn't want a woman to have to give up her eggs for my needs. Donating eggs for cloning of any type, therapeutic or not, could turn into a negative thing. Women, similar to being used for prostitution, could be forced to sell their eggs for money. There could be a black market for human egg cells. Would you really feel comfortable using a unwillingly given egg? If cloning was done with, this would never have a need to happen. Along with selling human egg cells, the percentage of miscarriages is undeniably high. 90% of all animal cloning pregnancies result in miscarriage. Most of these miscarriages happen later on in the pregnancy, according to The British Fertility Society. To me, never having a baby at all is better than conceiving one, and losing it. Besides, there are hundreds of thousands of children available for adoption in the U.S. alone.\", 'If you think cloning should be legal, then why are you contradicting yourself? You are saying that most think it is immoral, and that it goes against religious beliefs. This doesn\"t sound like a \"pro\" side argument to me. Since I am strongly believe that cloning is wrong, a huge issue that I have with it is that it could minimize the value of human life, and we wouldn\\'t be individuals. Human life could be looked upon as something you can perfectly create, and that if your child doesn\"t satisfy your needs, you can go out and get another one made, tailored to your specific wants. Also, a caste-like system could re-emerge, putting perfect clones on the top. They would be the \"genetically perfected\". Smart, and attractive. They would also most likely be rich, since cloning is highly expensive and time consuming. How does that sound to you? A race of beautiful, genius people that are treated better than the average. I can tell you one thing, you wouldn\"t like it at all. Naturally made humans may be treated differently than the clones. They are average. You wouldn\"t be considered smart, or pretty unless you were a clone. This is one of the possible negative consequences of cloning. Ethics are highly controversial in the case of cloning. Many thing is is wrong for scientists to \"play God\". Most traditional Christians refer to an embryo as a human being that has a soul. They think it is immoral for scientists to clone to create or destroy embryos, even in the case of research. Around 78.4 percent of America is Christian, according to \"Summary of Key Findings.\" Statistics on Religion in America Report. Web. 03 Mar. 2014. If cloning was legal, nearly 78.4 percent of the U.S.A. would disagree with it. They think that when using an unfertilized egg for any type of cloning you are killing a possible human, a possible child. This doesn\"t seem at all moral, to me.', 'Wouldn\"t you feel bad about wasting the possibility of life with an unsuccessful cloning experiment? With the use of embryonic cells, we\\'ve been successfully cloning mammals since the mid-1980\\'s, but the possibility of actually creating a clone goes from 0.1% to 3%. This means that for every 1000 attempts, 1 to 30 clones are produced. That is up to 70 eggs wasted. With reproductive cloning, those eggs could have possibly been babies. Do you feel comfortable allowing scientists to take away the possibility of life from an egg? I should hope not. In addition, cloning could take away a sense of individuality, since a clone is the genetically identical twin to the person who provided the genetic material, no matter the age of either person. In my opinion, cloning should not be allowed because it strips a human of individuality, and has a very low success rate.', \"I completely agree, IN A COURT OF LAW, the jury is suppossed to be an unbiased judge of a case. This is why random people are selected to for the jury. But in survivor you have played the whole game with the people that are then voting on your fate. FOr them to be impartial is impossible, and wy would you want them to be. Getting to the end and having the jury want to vote for you is one of the most challenging things in the game of survivor, making it tougher than almost any other reality TV show. So, if the jury deemed that they didn't want Russel to win, then he shouldnt have won.\", \"I am not going to deny the Russell Hantz played a good game of Survivor, in fact, it most probably the most manipulative game that the series has ever seen. I also won't argue the point the Russell Hantz 'outwitted and outlasted' his opponents, as this is clearly evident by the fact that he made it to the final three against a huge numbers disadvantage. However the main reason why Russell shouldn't have won Survivor is that he didn't. While this statement may, at first glance, appear to be tautological allow me to explain: There are ultimately two components involved in winning the game of Survivor. The first is to make it to the final three (or two), where the jury votes for the winner, and the second is to be able to win Jury votes once you are there. This aspect of Survivor is what makes it such an intriguing show. The winner is not necessarily the person who has played the best game from an outlasting point of view, but the person who the jury deems is the most deserving recipient of the title of Sole Survivor. The way in which Russell lied, backstabbed sabotaged and manipulated his way into the final 3 fulfilled the first requirement, but made the members of the jury so resentful towards him, that there was no way they would ever vote for him. Ultimately it comes down to the judgement and very often emotions, of these 9 people, and if they do not vote for you, it clearly illustrates that, out of the 3 members remaining, you are not who they believe should win and making the jury believe you should win is what Survivor, in essence, boils down to.Sure he may have found the hidden immunity idols .They weren't really that well hidden, and anyone with the time could have found them. Plus you must not forget that this is a TV show that can be influenced by the producers to enhance ratings. His sabotage of his own tribes campsite at the start of the game illustrates just how conniving he really was, and he certainly won't be the last to lose at the end in this way.\", 'Bring It OnI would like to point out that since Pro is arguing against the status quo, burden of proof is on them.', \"1. Initially, your argument that Russell lost because of the jury's decision makes some sense. However, we need to consider what a jury is. A jury is supposed to be an unbiased group of people making a decision about another person's fate. The jury should have objectively made a decision as to who played the best game of Survivor. Instead, the jury allowed their personal vendettas against Russell, as he caused many of them to leave the show to come into play. The jury was, thus, bitter, and not awarding based on gameplay. If it did look only at who played the best game, it would have chosen Russell over Natalie (and Mick Trimming, who came in third place). Russell led the alliance back from the 8-4 deficit. Natalie and Mick did not have to do any of the strategizing, instead riding Russell's coattails to the end. They did none of the necessary work, but reaped all of the benefits of Russell's strategy. How is that fair? Also, Russell won more challenges (5) than either Natalie or Mick, both of whom won 3. To sum it up, the point of a jury is to be objective and unbiased, which it was not by voting for Natalie to win.2. Yes, it is possible that the producers made the hidden immunity idols intentionally easy to find. However, that does not mean that Russell had any advantage over the rest of the field in finding them. Everyone else had an equal opportunity to find the hidden immunity idols, but only Russell was able to. When combined with the other ways in which he controlled the game (challenges, leading the alliance, etc.), Russell should have won Survivor: Samoa.3. His early-game sabotage is irrelevant. The fact that he burned socks and emptied water bottles has little to do with the game he played and should not be taken into account by an unbiased jury. Also, other factors, such as the fact that he was already a millionaire are also irrelevant.Russell Hantz should have won Survivor: Samoa.\", 'I also want to point out that, as Russell Hantz made the Final Tribal Council, this debate solely is about the jury\\'s decision. Yes, the Galu tribe would have been wise to vote Russell out at the merge, when it had a 8-4 numbers advantage. However, Russell was able to turn the tribe against each other, find hidden immunity idols without clues, and convince Shannon \"Shambo\" Walters to work with his tribe. Also, it is important to note that Survivor is a reality competition show. It is a game that features castaways trying to \"outwit, outplay, [and] outlast\" each other (the show\\'s slogan). That encourages players to fight at all costs to survive and eliminate their competition. As Russell was on a tribe that lost almost every challenge before the merge, his tribe was at a significant disadvantage going into the merge. However, Russell was a brilliant game player and had a strategy to overcome a numbers disadvantage. On Day 1, he made alliances with several members of his tribe, including eventual winner Natalie White. From there, he would vote off anyone who threatened his game. By the merge, all that remained of his tribe was a close-knit group called the \"Foa Foa Four\". He then led Survivor\\'s biggest post-merge comeback ever. Even after Galu voted off Erik Cardona, a member many people did not trust, Foa Foa had a 7-4 disadvantage. So, he convinced Shambo to join his alliance and found a hidden immunity idol WITHOUT A CLUE. He then played it at tribal council, negating the 7 votes cast against him (Shambo was trying to feign loyalty to Galu) and sending Kelly Sharbaugh home. Suddenly, a 8-4 disadvantage had turned to a 5-5 split. Russell then convinced John Fincher, fearing the Purple Rock tiebreaker that could eliminate anyone, to vote with Foa Foa and blindside Laura Morett. Now, Foa Foa had a numbers advantage it would take to the end.', \"Inducting these below average players would not be representative of one of the most profitable, successful, and enjoyable eras in all of baseball. Yes, in hindsight, it was an unfair advantage, but virtually everyone was doing it. To leave out Bonds, A-Rod, Clemens, and Pettite would be leaving out four of the best players of all time (just to name a few). And most doctors have agreed with the point that PED's have a rather low plateau in terms of improving overall game, and that they act more as a longevity helper. Skill is there, PED help keep it going longer. You can't leave out an entire era of baseball, just because the players did what was inherent of the time; take PED's.\", \"The Hall of Fame is merely glorifying the biggest money makers/employees of the league. Sure, you can romanticize baseball, but when it comes down to it, it is simply a business. If you let in the all the average players from the 25 year span of steroid prevalence, you are downgrading the overall quality of the Hall. You call it cheating, but there wasn't rules of regulations put in place at the time. It was stupid not to use steroids during this time. Most players will admit that steroids didn't effect the quality of their game, but rather just helped to extend their career. This may create artificially inflated records, but it's not like Clemens, Pettite, Bonds, A-Rod, Conseco, and Martinez wouldn't have been great players without them. Cheating comes from breaking the rules. No rules = no cheating. Hindsight is 20/20 but you can't penalize people for doing what everyone else was doing. So, should we induct Darrell Strawberry into the hall for being average? No.\", \"Well, we meet again. If we were to prevent MLB players from entering the Hall of Fame because they used steroids; nearly every All-Star from 1980 to early 2000's would be ineligible. Take a look at the Mitchell Report, and you will find a list of incredible players which is far too long to list on here, who would all be banned from baseball's greatest honor. Steroids were just as part of the game during the 80's and 90's as Peanuts and Cracker Jacks. It was an era of steroids. If you weren't using them, then you were considered abnormal. You cannot fault an entire generation of players for just being a product of the times. I agree that records, such as the HR record broken by Bonds, should have an asterisk with them, but this should not be the case with the Hall of Fame. If we were to do what you propose, then from 1980 to 2000 there would be about 5 people in the Hall.\", \"I am not saying all average players should make it but what about above average players who werent as good as the ones that used steriods? They won't make it because these people used steriods and got a chance at getting ahead of them.

You think there going to tell you, yeah it helped my game out a lot, they wouldn't say that. They are lying you, they make a false claim with no evidence to support that claim. They have no evidence it didn't effect their game. Why do you think they call it performance enhancing drugs, key words performance enhancing. Do you understand what performance enhancing means? It means that it improves your game, so them saying it didn't is lies. If steriods didn't enhance each players game play why would they ban it? If it didn't effect their quality of play why would the MLB ban it?\", 'No, they cheated therefore they shouldn\\'t make the hall of fame. It doesn\\'t matter if a lot of players did it. They cheated therefore they should be penalized. The people who make the Hall of Fame should be in there because of their honor to the game, not for cheating and deceiving people so they can have a physical advantage. You said that there are many \"incredible players\" in the Mitchell Report. Don\\'t you think maybe they were so incredible because they used steriods and performance enhancing drugs? If they didn\\'t use them they wouldn\\'t be as good as the stats show. I understand players are out there to get theirs and get as much money as they can, but what about the true players of the game who aren\\'t using these performing enhancing drugs.

This includes Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds, and all the other players that used them. I believe that if you use these you are getting an advantage that everyone else isn't.

They should never be able to be among the Hall of Fame electors like Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron who did it with out performance enhancing drugs.\", 'lol well I addressed 1 yes but I think these points can also be applied to 2 and 3., let\\'s see. For 2, Religious minorities have not \"flourished\" under Islam. In fact, they have dwindled to mere shadows after centuries of persecution and discrimination. Some were converted from their native religion by brute force, others under the agonizing strain of dhimmitude. What Muslims call \"tolerance,\" others correctly identify as institutionalized discrimination. The consignment of Jews and Christians to dhimmis under Islamic rule means that they are not allowed the same religious rights and freedoms as Muslims. They cannot share their faith, for example, or build houses of worship without permission. Historically, dhimmis have often had to wear distinguishing clothing or cut their hair in a particular manner that indicates their position of inferiority and humiliation. They do not share the same legal rights as Muslims, and must even pay a poll tax (the jizya). They are to be killed or have their children taken from them if they cannot satisfy the tax collector\"s requirements. For hundreds of years, the Christian population in occupied Europe had their sons taken away and forcibly converted into Muslim warriors (known as Jannisaries) by the Ottoman Turks. It is under this burden of discrimination and third-class status that so many religious minorities converted to Islam over the centuries. Those who didn\"t often faced economic and social hardships that persist to this day and are appalling by Western standards of true religious tolerance and pluralism. For those who are not \"the People of the Book,\" such as Hindus and atheists, there is very little tolerance to be found once Islam establishes political superiority. The Quran tells Muslims to \"fight in the way of Allah\" until \"religion is only for Allah.\" The conquered populations face death if they do not establish regular prayer and charity in the Islamic tradition (ie. the pillars of Islam). Tamerlane and other Muslim warriors slaughtered tens of millions of Hindus and Buddhists, and displaced or forcibly converted millions more over the last thousand years. Islamists in Somalia behead Christians. In Iran, they are jailed. One of the great ironies of Islam is that non-Muslims are to be treated according to the very standards by which Muslims themselves would claim the right to violent self-defense were the shoe on the other foot. Islam is its own justification. Most Muslims therefore feel no need to explain the ingrained arrogance and double standard. There are about 500 verses in the Quran that speak of Allah\"s hatred for non-Muslims and the punishment that he has prepared for their unbelief. There is also a tiny handful that say otherwise, but these are mostly earlier verses that many scholars consider to be abrogated by the later, more violent ones. As for Sura 109, any true Quran scholar will point out that the purpose of the verse was to distinguish Islam from the gods of the Quraysh (one of which was named \"Allah\") rather than to advocate religious tolerance for non-Muslims. At the time that he narrated this very early verse, Muhammad did not have any power, and thus no choice but to be \"tolerant\" of others. By contrast, there was no true tolerance shown when he returned to Mecca with power many years later and demanded the eviction or death of anyone who would not convert to Islam. In fact, he physically destroyed the cherished idols of the people to whom he had previously addressed in Sura 109. If tolerance simply means discouraging the mass slaughter of those of a different faith, then today\\'s Islam generally meets this standard more often than not. But, if tolerance means allowing people of other faiths the same religious liberties that Muslims enjoy, then Islam is fundamentally the most intolerant religion under the sun. For 3, There is not the least bit of intolerance for slavery anywhere in the Quran. In fact, the \"holy\" book of Islam explicitly gives slave-owners the freedom to sexually exploit their slaves \" not just in one place, but in at least four separate Suras. Islamic law is littered with rules concerning the treatment of slaves, some of which are relatively humane, but none that prohibit the actual practice by any stretch. Vote for me!!!', 'There shouldn\\'t be any argument over who the \"true Muslim\" is because the Quran clearly distinguishes the true Muslim from the pretender in Sura 9 and elsewhere. According to this - one of the last chapters of the Quran - the true believer \"strives and fights with their wealth and persons\" while the hypocrites are those who \"sit at home,\" refusing to join the jihad against unbelievers in foreign lands. In truth, Muhammad organized 65 military campaigns in the last ten years of his life and personally led 27 of them. The more power that he attained, the smaller the excuse needed to go to battle, until finally he began attacking tribes merely because they were not yet part of his growing empire. After Muhammad\"s death, his successor immediately went to war with former allied tribes which wanted to go their own way. Abu Bakr called them \\'apostates\\' and slaughtered anyone who did not want to remain Muslim. Eventually, he was successful in holding the empire together through blood and violence. The prophet of Islam\\'s most faithful followers and even his own family soon turned on each other as well. There were four caliphs (leaders) in the first twenty-five years, each of which was a trusted companion of his. Three of these four were murdered. The third caliph was murdered by those allied with the son of the first caliph. The fourth caliph was murdered in the midst of a conflict with the fifth caliph, who began a 100-year dynasty of excess and debauchery that was brought to an end in a gruesome, widespread bloodbath by descendents of Muhammad\"s uncle (who was not even a Muslim). Muhammad\"s own daughter, Fatima, and his son-in-law, Ali, who both survived the pagan hardship during the Meccan years safe and sound, did not survive Islam after the death of Muhammad. Fatima died of stress from persecution within three months, and Ali was later assassinated by Muslim rivals. Their son (Muhammad\"s grandson) was killed in battle with the faction that became today\"s Sunnis. His people became Shias. The relatives and personal friends of Muhammad were mixed into both warring groups, which then fractured further into hostile sub-divisions as Islam expanded. Muslim apologists, who like to say that is impossible for today\\'s terrorists to be Muslim when they kill fellow Muslims, would have a very tough time explaining the war between Fatima\\'s followers and Aisha to a knowledgeable audience. Muhammad explicitly held up both his favorite daughter and his favorite wife as model Muslim women, yet they were invoked respectively by each side in the violent civil war that followed his death. Which one was the prophet of God so horribly wrong about? Muhammad left his men with instructions to take the battle against Christians, Persians, Jews and polytheists (which came to include millions of unfortunate Hindus). For the next four centuries, Muslim armies steamrolled over unsuspecting neighbors, plundering them of loot and slaves, and forcing the survivors to either convert or pay tribute at the point of a sword. Companions of Muhammad lived to see Islam declare war on every major religion in the world in just the first few decades following his death - pressing the Jihad against Hindus, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Buddhists. By the time of the Crusades (when the Europeans began fighting back), Muslims had conquered two-thirds of the Christian world by sword, from Syria to Spain, and across North Africa. Millions of Christians were enslaved by Muslims, and tens of millions of Africans. The Arab slave-trading routes would stay open for 1300 years until pressure from Christian-based countries forced Islamic nations to declare the practice illegal (in theory). To this day, the Muslim world has never apologized for the victims of Jihad and slavery. There is not another religion in the world that consistently produces terrorism in the name of God as does Islam. The most dangerous Muslims are nearly always those who interpret the Quran most transparently. They are the fundamentalists or purists of the faith, and believe in Muhammad\"s mandate to spread Islamic rule by the sword, putting to death those who will not submit. In the absence of true infidels, they will even turn on each other. The holy texts of Islam are saturated with verses of violence and hatred toward those outside the faith, as well as the aforementioned \"hypocrites\" (Muslims who don\\'t act like Muslims). In sharp contrast to the Bible, which generally moves from relatively violent episodes to far more peaceful mandates, the Quran travels the exact opposite path (violence is first forbidden, then permitted, then mandatory). The handful of earlier verses that speak of tolerance are overwhelmed by an avalanche of later ones that carry a much different message. While Old Testament verses of blood and guts are generally bound by historical context within the text itself, Quranic imperatives to violence usually appear open-ended and subject to personal interpretation. From the history of the faith to its most sacred writings, those who want to believe in \"peaceful Islam\" have a lot more to ignore than do the terrorists. By any objective measure, the \"Religion of Peace\" has been the harshest, bloodiest religion the world has ever known. In Islam there is no peace unless Muslims have power - and even then...', 'There are some facts to what you said but most is speculation.

It uses circular reasoning, or it begs the question.B. It special pleads god\\'s exemption.A. By saying that things \"begin to exist,\" you automatically create a set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" and a set of \"things that do begin to exist.\" The problem is that the set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" ends up only having one thing in it, god, which makes separating \"begin to exist things\" and \"not beginning to exist things\" a way to smuggle in god\\'s presumed exemption in the conclusion.The assertion that a thing, god, didn\\'t begin to exist in the premise is simply repeated by saying that god is the only member of the \"didn\\'t begin to exist\" set in the conclusion, which is begging the question or circular reasoning.http://www.logicallyfallacious.com...B. By asserting that everything began to exist, except for god, you are special pleading god\\'s exemption to the assumed rule. Without an explanation of how god should be considered exempt from the category, exempting him is special pleading, thus it is flawed logic and we can reject the conclusions from such.Pro, other than bare assertions, like \"god is uncaused,\" how is god exempt from the beginning to exist rule that you openly endorse?Pro, could you explain the mechanism by which god accomplishes this exemption?If you can\\'t, then how do you know that this exemption has occurred?Pro continues:\"The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause.\"My response:Much like the process of creation, causation is also temporal.This means that time could not have been caused, because causation itself requires time.It\\'s like saying, \"time began to exist as the result of a time event that occurred BEFORE the existence of time.\"The temporal contradictions of creation and causation at [+0,-0] have not been addressed by Pro.Pro baldly asserts again:\"God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused.\"My response:Aside from this egregious tautology, Pro simply asserts that god was uncaused and provides no explanation as to how this is the case.I could just as easily assert that flagoiganberries are self existing beings, uncaused, and need no answer, and I would have accomplished the same level of demonstration that Pro has with his asserted god.Pro tried to draw a similarity between designed-by-human computers and the universe.I pointed out that if Pro is going to say that the universe was designed, which I also reject, like computers, then the universe, like computers, was designed by a natural, not supernatural, intelligence.Pro responds:\"To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\"My response:No, it\\'s another way of pointing out that your \"universe is like a computer\" analogy doesn\\'t support a supernatural entity like your proposed god.Instead, your analogy shows that natural designs come from natural agents, so if the natural universe was designed, your analogy would indicate that a natural entity was responsible; this is not indicative of a supernatural designer, the type of designer Pro is attempting to affirm.Pro continues:\"Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance.\"My response:Yeah, natural entities are responsible for these computer codes, hence why computer codes are not \"magical.\"Pro furthers:\"[Something magically popping into existence is] synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened.\"My response:Well, again, all of the examples EVER of video games have been shown to be designed by a natural entity, but we only have one example of the universe, and it has not been shown to be designed...the absurdity of the random video game manifestation contradicts the many examples of designed video games and is therefore nontransferable to the universe which has no standard examples with which to compare.Pro retorts:\"Con has...declared that there once was no time...time \"became\" at some point...since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist.\"My response:Ah, Pro addressed it finally.Creation and origin are not the same thing.creation - the process of bringing something into existence.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...origin - the point where something begins.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...Time therefore had an origin, a POINT called the big bang, yet it did not experience a PROCESS of being created; that process must occur over time and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof.So, it\\'s NOT illogical to concede an origin, but not a creation.Creation is a series of events and an origin is a point; the terms are different.Pro stays adamant:\"Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause.\"My response:Again, this is like saying, \"Time was placed in motion in the first place by a time-based action.\"How can a cause, a thing occurring over time, happen without time?Pro adds:\"Without God, time and space never roll into motion...it would take a tremendous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from?\"My response:I guess Pro ignored all of my round 2...oh well, here it is in a different way.Quantum fluctuations are what nothing is, and this nothing is unstable; nothing cannot remain, so something, energy, is guaranteed.At [+0,-0], spacetime fluctuated in and out of existence with the other fluctuating variables in quantum fluctuations, but once matter became stative [+1,-1], so did space.At this point [+1,-1], space was as small as a virtual sub nuclear particle, so the proportion of stative energy from QF to such small space was massive...so massive that it drove the inflation of space.http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Pro reasons:\"If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is.\"My response:Did you look at my 2nd round, Pro?All of the answers are there and sourced.But to save you the scroll...Right, at [+0,-0], unstable quantum fluctuations have space, time, matter, and energy fluctuating in and out of existence such that there is no stative time or the passage thereof, thus no temporal concepts like creation/causation occur.But at [+0,-0], once a virtual sub nuclear particle avoids annihilation from its antiparticle, which is the inherent instability of QF, matter, energy, space and time are then stative [+1,-1] and this is the origin of the universe; it\\'s an origin, not a creation.Stative space at this point is so small that any stative energy is proportionally quite powerful-->inflation.Pro ignores my round 2 some more:\"Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint.\"My response:Though it\\'s not a cause, time and space in the first place is not only knowable, it\\'s been demonstrated by the WMAP from NASA.[+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations-->[+1,-1] Big Bang.Here\\'s the model again: http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...Pro gets bold:\"If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity.\"My response:Pro, read my round 2 thoroughly...and check NASA\\'s Big Bang Model that I\\'ve provided twice now.Pro finishes:\"If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless.\"My response:Let me translate.\"This gives a lot of room to the notion of a user of time-based actions that is timeless.\"Pro, do you see the contradiction in your assertions?If the creator is timeless, then why is he defined as a user of time i.e. a creator?', 'Thanks Pro for your response. I maintain that the universe was not created, because of the temporal problems of such a claim. Without a universe at [+0,-0], there is no stative time in order to correctly declare that a temporal process, creation, occurred; no time, no creation, no creator. But Pro doesn\\'t seem to see it that way... *Round 1 Rebuttal* Pro asserts: \"Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event.\" My response: Nope. I\\'ve explained, that without god, the universe has an origin, and, because there is no stative time in [+0,-0] quantum fluctuations, there is no infinity of time; time began when the universe began, so I guess this is our \"first mother.\" Pro asks: \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken.\" My response: Well, you didn\\'t ask me before your assertion about everyone. The egg came first, because mutations that lead to speciation occur in the zygote, which is inside the egg. Therefore, the predecessor to the chicken had a mutation occur within the egg that makes that egg a chicken egg, which lead to the first chicken. The egg came first. Pro continues: \"Many scientists have stated that if the fundamental physical constants were to vary even so slightly, the establishment of matter, astronomical constructs, elemental diversity, and life, as humans know it would have never happened. Reality is beyond a miracle.\" My response: No, you\\'re just calling an after-the-fact result a miracle. This doesn\\'t show there must be a creator, it just shows that the low odds of existence happened. Low odds do not necessitate purposiveness. *Round 2 Rebuttal* Pro claims: \"There is no empty space. There is a \"bubbling soup\" of quantum field fluctuations that come and go quickly.\" My response: I agree, and in this state at [+0,-0], there is no stative time. Instead, time is just another variable that \"comes and goes quickly\" with the other fluctuating variables. So when there was no universe, [+0,-0], time did not remain; it fluctuated. Pro adds: \"In the double slit experiment we see an interesting phenomenon of quantum strangeness. When nonobserved electrons cause patterns of waves. When observed, their behavior and pattern changes based on observation.\" My response: Yup. I fail to see what this has to do with quantum fluctuations or the creation of the universe/stative time, but the double slit experiment shows that particles can be both a particle and a wavelength. Pro then claims: \"SPACE TIME DOES NOT RESTRICT THE LORD\" My response: Aside from this being a bare assertion, the lack of spacetime restricts creation, a process that REQUIRES time to have occurred. No time, no creation, no creator, no created universe. Pro attempts to support this assertion with the bible: \"In the book of John, Jesus Christ made a statement concerning time and its relation to Him...in our sense of time Christ walked the Earth after Moses and Elijah had been dead and gone a long time.\" My response: Pro, why should we consider the bible authoritative on matters of time or the universe? So what if the bible says that \"Moses face was shining like the sun, and the Children of Israel put a veil over his face?\" What does any of this have to do with the creation of the universe? Pro makes another bare assertion: \"There is one way known to satisfy the paradox of infinite causes. If you can name another, go ahead.\" My response: [+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations --> [+1,-1] Big Bang. Check my round 2 for sources on this. Pro continues: \"If you examine a computer and its constructs, you would know an intelligence created it.\" My response: Yeah, and every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity. So, applying this rule to the universe, you should conclude that something natural, not supernatural like god, was responsible. Also, we have only one example of a universe, unlike our many examples of computers from which we can deduce commonalities; or maybe Pro can find another universe that indicates his claim. Pro piles on: \"Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code...it isn\"t just random 1\"s and 0\"s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software.\" My response: Despite theawakenment.com\\'s lack of credibility on matters of the universe or existence, simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe. Pro goes on about genetic code: \"Genomes use the genetic code to write two completely separate languages. The first explains how proteins are made, and the other commands the cell on how genes will be controlled.\" My response: Ok, well when you have a debate about the origins of life, then maybe you could bring this up, but in a debate about the universe, this is irrelevant. Pro then provides a clip from the Matrix to explain \"What is real?\" All the clip shows is that there was a fictional movie made with Keanu Reeves...that\\'s it. Then Pro mentions: \"Einstein...demonstrated time as having a point.\" My response: Yeah, like the Big Bang. Pro adds: \"Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will.\" My response: Ok, but this puts Jesus as the result, not the cause. Pro furthers: \"In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model.\" My response: Nothing about the Big Bang model involves speaking anything...that Genesis mentions light and light is an elementary particle is coincidence and not indicative of Genesis\\'s authoritativeness on matters of the universe. Pro finishes: \"This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority.\" My response: How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself? I\\'m not attacking god, I\\'m attacking the TEMPORAL process of creation occurring without time...it\\'s inherently nonsensical. Pro should attempt to address the temporal problems of calling the origin of time \"creation.\" How do you discern creator from created without time? I reject this resolution, because, without stative time, temporal processes cannot occur.', 'I think this is gonna be a good one. I reject the claim that the universe was created at all, let alone by an agent, including a presumed god. To have something created, brought into existence per this debate, there needs to be stative time and the passage thereof to allow the process of creation to occur. Creation necessarily requires:1. a creator remaining long enough to create2. the action of this creator creating3. the subsequent existence of the created productWithout stative time and the passage thereof, a temporal process like creation, or bringing something into existence, is nonsensical. How could one discern a creator from its created product without the passage of stative time? Creators must precede their creations, and precedence, the fact of occurring earlier in time, requires stative time. I reject this resolution, because stative time\\'s origin and the universe\\'s origin are in fact the same, which negates a temporal process like creation from occurring without the universe. *THE UNIVERSE*All existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. Our universe has matter and space. Matter distorts space and creates gravity. . http://www.einstein-online.info...The way that particle physicists and cosmologists look at the total universe\\'s energy is by the totality of observable matter (you, me, the planets and stars) and gravity (distortions of space). . https://en.wikipedia.org...Matter, in this energy combination, acts as positive energy (+), because matter is doing the distorting. Gravity, in this energy combination, acts as negative energy (-), because it\\'s a result of the distorting. So, what if we could see how curved space is throughout the entire observable universe given this (+)matter and (-)gravity interplay? Well we can, and we have, using the WMAP, which is an anisotropy probe attached to a space shuttle that measures variations in the otherwise uniform Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and gives us a massively accurate picture of the scale, shape, and size of the observable universe. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...We now know that our universe is flat, because the spacial curvature (the total effect of matter on space) of the universe is zero. . http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org...Therefore, all of the positive energy (+matter) is exactly being cancelled out by all of the negative energy (-gravity) in our universe, so that the total energy [+matter,-gravity] of the universe is in fact zero. As a set, the universe\\'s matter and gravity would look like [+matter, -gravity] = 0So, we could imagine what the set might look like currently, given our massive universe of +matter and -gravity. .. [+10000000000000,-10000000000000] = 0This shows lots of +matter and lots of -gravity exactly cancelled out. But when there was no universe, matter and gravity were at [+0,-0] = 0At [+0,-0], there is no matter or gravity to speak of and of course the total energy is 0. In this zero energy state, there is/are no radiation/particles/wavelengths/matter/energy/space/time/gravity. .. nothing [+0,-0]= 0. So, for this debate, I will be referring to the otherwise inaccurate phrase, \"before the universe,\" as [+0,-0], when there was no universe. *QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS (QF)*In our universe of space and matter, when you strip \"something\" of particles, radiation, and energy, you are left with nothing but empty space; this empty space is full of quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are sub nuclear particles (not actually full particles, which is why some physicists call them \"virtual\" particles) existing and being annihilated by antiparticles, and the forces between these sub nuclear particles fluctuate along with this existence and annihilation. I have to make this point perfectly clear. These sub nuclear particles fluctuating in and out of existence are what nothing is, and this is always the case. This is what nothing is. . http://scholarsresearchlibrary.com...The article above refers to quantum fluctuations as vacuum fluctuations because, in our universe of space and matter, we\\'ve detected these fluctuations by using a vacuum that strips the basics of something from empty space. But the sub nuclear particles in QF are something, right? Nope. They never statively exist; they exist and don\\'t exist at the same instant, and it is this fluctuation that makes up nothing. There is no \"nothing\" without these fluctuations, period. What is nothing? It is a state of fluctuating sub nuclear particles and their forces called quantum fluctuations. That video is short and explanatory of QF = nothing. Quantum fluctuations are as real as microorganisms, and we\\'ve demonstrated and measured their effect, in current space, in detail. . http://physics.aps.org...However, at [+0,-0], unlike our current universe, there was no space, and instead, like the forces between the sub nuclear particles, space and time fluctuated along with the sub nuclear particles. Space is merely the position of matter or the distance between matter; matter dictates space. At [+0,-0], in a quantum fluctuation, a sub-nuclear particle exists and is simultaneously annihilated by its antiparticle, and this pseudo moment allows for the fluctuated existence/nonexistence of space and time and the forces between the sub-nuclear particles; this was the condition at [+0,-0], which is a constant fluctuation of time/space/matter/energy/gravity thanks to QF. These zero-energy quantum fluctuations, nothing, are such an unstable state that energy is guaranteed to be expressed from them; that expression is called the big bang and is the origin of our universe. From nothing [+0,-0] to something [+1,-1] = The Big Bang. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...*THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE - THE BIG BANG*Pro has already conceded that the Big Bang occurred, but in order to explain why the universe couldn\\'t have been created, by god or otherwise, I must explain our current understanding of the Big Bang model. With the right radio telescope, even you can see that the space between the stars above us isn\\'t just black space, it\\'s filled with microwave radiation. . http://science.nasa.gov...All of this CMB radiation, which is a \"black body\" as it absorbs all intercepted electromagnetic radiation, is nearly a uniform glow between stars across the universe, and is a proven indicator of an expandable hot dense state such as the Big Bang being the cosmos\\' origin. . http://www.mpg.de...The small variations in the microwave\\'s uniformity, show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot dense state that has expanded to the current size of the universe; this is called inflation. . http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Yeah, that link is from Cambridge. .. I know, argument from authority. .. go to page 9 of the PDF which is page 2 of the preface. These small variations have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of sub-nuclear particles, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. *THE RESOLUTION IS FALSE*Unfortunately for this resolution, at [+0,-0], in quantum fluctuations, there was no stative time, because there was no stative space. Space and time are part of a continuum, so we call it spacetime. . http://www.einstein-online.info...I reject the claim that the universe has a creator, god, because creation is a temporal process, contingent on stative time, and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof, because there was no stative space; temporal processes like creation are nonsensical without stative time. Therefore, a creator of the universe cannot be, because there is no creator of a universe that wasn\\'t created.', \"*No acceptance round; just start debating.*Definitions can be changed, BEFORE ACCEPTING the debate, in the comments section, as long as both Pro and Con agree, otherwise...*Definitions below are agreed to by accepting the debate.ResolutionThe universe was created by god.ProHas the Burden of Proof and 4 sets of 10,000 characters to AFFIRM the resolution that the universe was created by god.

The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause. God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused. Con stated: \"...every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity.\" To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\" And humans are intelligent agents who designed these computers. * Con Stated: \"...simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe.\" Microsoft and Google were created by humans, which are intelligent agents who created such software. Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance. It\\'s synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened. We know this is impossible without an intelligent designer. And our reality is much more complex than Call of Duty 4. We are talking about Grand Theft Auto on super steroids in our case of reality. I assume Con does not believe in magic, nor do I. * Con said: \"How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself?\" Con has with this statement declared that there once was no time. Time \"became\" at some point. This would indicate that time being put into motion in the first place was caused. He says that without time there \"could be no creation\", yet must cede that there was a \"creation\", whether by God or by something else all together, otherwise we wouldn\\'t exist. There was a beginning event that propelled the start of our reality of space and time. Since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist. We need an agent to start the process that is beyond time, seeing that without time we can have no creation event otherwise, according to Con. Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause. What is that cause? God? Something else? Without God, time and space never roll into motion. A stationary time and space sounds nice, but potential is not potential at all without a cause. It\\'s like watching a leaf sitting in one spot for an hour. Suddenly it picks up, moves across the yard, and goes into motion. Why? It\\'s motion had a cause. Without the wind or some other external cause, the leaf would not move. Thus, it is the same with time and space. It would take a tremedous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from? If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is. * Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint. If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity. * If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless. So what do we know in accordance with Con\\'s assertion of stationary or nonexistant time. 1)Time did not exist/was not in motion, and yet we exist. 2)Whatever the cause is of the creation or putting into motion of time, is timeless and not affected by time, otherwise nothing would have happened, thus we would not exist. 3)If causes can be non-effected by time and be causes in the first place, then whatever is the construct of that system allows for a timeless creator.

In the New Testament Christ had a perplexing event where His disciples were terrified at what was happening and could not understand it. \"Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.\" (Matthew 17:3) When whatever was happening initially stopped, Jesus turned towards them and... \"There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.\" (Matthew 17:2) When Moses prior, in Exodus, finished speaking to the Lord... In Exodus 34:35, Moses face was shining like the sun, and the Children of Israel put a veil over his face. * Perhaps a video showing how that might work would be beneficial for visual conceptualisation.

If you can name another, go ahead. The construct of this method is indisputably designed. If you examine a computer and its constructs, you would know an intelligence created it. How can our reality have no first event, be infinite, and yet still be? Well, let\\'s see what the Science Advisor to the President of the United States of America says. -James Gates, Physicist and Science Advisor to Barack Obama. James Gates and his researchers discovered something very intriguing buried within the mathematical equations of super symmetry. What did they find? They found computer code. Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code. This is a specific type of code referred to as \"self correcting code\". Richard Hamming established this coding system building on the concepts of Claude Shannon. Thus it is sometimes called \"Hamming Code\". And it isn’t just random 1’s and 0’s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software. http://theawakenment.com... James Gates himself- http://youtu.be... * Genomes use the genetic code to write two completely separate languages. The first explains how proteins are made, and the other commands the cell on how genes will be controlled. One language is written on top of the other. Isn\\'t it interesting that so much of our reality is codes and languages? www.washington.edu/news/2013/12/12/scientists-discover-double-meaning-in-genetic-code * From DNA and RNA, to codons, the mathematically programmed construct of reality, everything shouts from the rooftops,\"Intelligent design!\" * What is reality? Let\\'s check it out. \"What is real\"? http://youtu.be... *In reality we do not need an answer for the answer if the answer is from beyond our reality. If the answer is from this reality, it demands an answer for the cause of every caused thing in an infinite regress. We must have a singularity somewhere. This singularity must come from outside, or beyond our reality. Once we establish it as the answer, we do not need an answer for the answer. When the answer comes from beyond our reality, it becomes a futile thing to attempt to define the construct of anything from beyond our reality. But, you know me. I\\'ll give it a go.Einstein referred to time interms of upper dimensions. He demonstrated time as having a point. From the point time could go in any direction as if in upper dimensional space, similar to how we move on a complex highway system, forward, to the left, up, then back down, and all around. Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will. From that point of \"time and space\" He can go to \"the beginning\". He can go to \"the end\". He exists as born, a man, creator, and finisher. He Himself said in the book of Revelation, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega. The beginning and the end.\" In 1 John he is referred to in the status of that all things that exist exist only from Him. In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model. In Revelation, God has come finishing it all. Via prophecy, God declared the beginning from the end. If He truely knows the end, He exists in the future, in the past, and in the present. He is omnipresent. This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority. He is timeless, immaterial, yet material all at once. He is the singularity. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient as a programmer can be all of those things over the worlds he creates, thus it is with God, yet with more complexity than man can comprehend. The Alpha is the cause of the beginning. The Omega is cause of the end.', 'Atheism is logically impossible. Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken. Why? Because the human mind knows that we must have a first uncaused cause. It\\'s common sense. The concept of everyone having a mother, yet there being no \"first mother\" is obviously absurd and illogical. The same applies for causes. Everything was caused, but there is no first cause? It\\'s identical logic. Thus, we cannot exist...unless...there is a cause from outside of space and time existing beyond the laws of science and time as we know them. * Atheistic Philosophical question- \"How can God exist beyond our reality?\" How can a computer programmer exist outside of the video game he creates? They just do. That is simply reality as we know it. --- The universe began to exist.

The original argument was that there should be intelligent life \"teaming\" across the Milky Way. After years of searching audably and by sight, nothing came to fruition. This phenomenon was so named the Fermi Paradox. Where is everyone? An original model of what conditions must exist for a planet to support life became bigger, and bigger, and bigger until... Carl Sagan in connection with this equation came to an interesting conclusion. He said that NO planets can support life. (That would include Earth.) The given number was 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 in probability, and equated to a quarter coming up heads a quadzillion times in a row for the environment of Earth to exist at all. ----- It took the blink of an eye for the equation of our existance to manifest itself. If any one thing had been different, our universe could not exist at all. Many scientists have stated that if the fundamental physical constants were to vary even so slightly, the establishment of matter, astronomical constructs, elemental diversity, and life, as humans know it would have never happened. Reality is beyond a miracle. ----- Fred Hoyle who coined the term \"big bang\" said the findings of science had shook his once unmoved belief in Atheism to its core. Paul Davies described how he \"loved Hoyle\\'s maverick personality and contempt for orthodoxy.\" * The DNA code, based on \"codons\", informs and programs a cell\\'s behavior. Wikipedia describes codon as such: \"A codon is defined by the initial nucleotide from which translation starts. For example, the string GGGAAACCC, if read from the first position, contains the codons GGG, AAA, and CCC; and, if read from the second position, it contains the codons GGA and AAC; if read starting from the third position, GAA and ACC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5\\' to 3\\' direction in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence. With double-stranded DNA, there are six possible reading frames, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand. The actual frame from which a protein sequence is translated is defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG codon in the mRNA sequence.\" Codes? Design? You tell me.

This is not where the definitive answer lies. Religion is the study of the supernatural. This is where the answer lies. ** The Bible told the future of the world.

Strangely, thousands of years later the New Testament, as confirmed by Christ, depicted this battle exactly as it is today in ways no one could have known. (Genesis 3:15)Finally Christ depicted the condition of the world as that many would fall away from the faith. Atheism is on the move in all of the West and quickly. He said the world would go into economic collapse, become ungodly, have perplexing world issues, the youth would become rebellious to authority and their parents, people would begin to rebel against and mock God, and \"knowledge\" would be the cause.

First of all, I do know something about both games. I have Guitar Hero 2 and 3, AND Rock Band. ok. 1. Yes, there are two sets of buttons, but they do basically the same thing. Are they in the same order? Yes. Are they anything THAT different? No. 2. I never said anything about difficulty, and difficulty doesn't always make a game better. But if we're talking about difficulty, the drums are definitely in question. The drums are DEFINITELY a source of difficulty in the game. Also Harmonix did that ON PURPOSE, so the game is more accessible to people on their first time playing. Because of this, more people can play, which links to my argument of MULTIPLAYER experience. More people play=fun to harmonix standards. 3. This argument of videos makes little sense. You argue that guitar hero has more videos than rock band on youtube, but how does that make guitar hero any BETTER? Just because something has more videos, is it better? No. This means nothing with your resolution.\", \"First of all, I see this is you're first debate on debate.org, so I'll be the first to say welcome! Haha Ok, now to the debate! Guitar Hero is a great game. However, I don't think how fun it is compares to Rock Band. Guitar Hero can do whammys, online play, and co-op, but Rock Band can do it too. Rock Band can use guitar hero guitars, so anything that a guitar hero guitar can do, Rock Band can. Its awesome, but rock band can do it too What guitar hero DOESN't have is the multiplayer experience. Rock Band has guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, while Guitar hero only has guitar and bass. This means that co-op mode on Rock Band is WAY more fun. Also, Rock Band has a great song list, that anyone can like, because there is variety.\", \"yo man you know notin first of all the guitars in rock band have two sets of buttons and one side doesnt really i've tried and the game rock band is easy on drums guitar bass guitar and definetly microphone the songs on guitar hero are challenging and guitar hero is really famous even check on youtube you will find more guitar hero vids than rock band and how many games does rockband made so far so haaaaaaaaaaaaa\", 'i think guitar hero is better because they have cool attacks such as amp oveload or whammy those are cool and guitar hero has 5 games. guitar hero is for the 360, ps2, ps3 and thats it. also you can play online with other people and also co-op mode and really nice songs please vote for guitar hero!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'When you wrote: \"Kidnapper states \"yes we are breaking the law but everybody here understands that it is our tradition and you can\"t change it.\" (3.37) I believe you are mistaken about what part of the law the kidnapper was referencing. While it\"s true that kidnappers were aware that their actions were against the law, the breaking of the law discussed in the video is almost directly pertaining to the act of the kidnapping itself. They admit that taking someone off the street by force is wrong. What I don\"t necessarily see in your premise is how kidnapping on its own can be linked to the occurrence of rape. It\"s unlikely that they believed that their actions are contributing to the girl being eventually raped and most likely they were convinced they were simply following the tradition. The best man even states that if they were stopped by the police, they simply would have clarified that kidnapping was part of a wedding party, and that would most likely suffice as an explanation (20 mins-20 secs). Your claim: \"At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)\" has some determination problems as well. The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. I fail to see how the time interval between kidnapping of the bride in the video and her eventual decision to consent is conducive to her consenting to marriage and sex. At the time of consent during the wedding ceremony, the use of force during kidnapping seems already irrelevant in her decision making. When she says \"yes\" to marriage, she already has full autonomy and is undeniably aware that she can say \"no\" without any fear of harm being done to her. It is possible that, in the situation when she does not consent, the process of convincing her to marry could perhaps go on for days (15 mins-00 secs). In that case, mental and physical fatigue could be a contributing factor in obtaining consent and initial use of force during kidnapping could be linked to eventual sex. That though, has not taken place in the video. I do see problems with this claim as well: \"A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) \". Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).', 'The main principle regarding the act of rape seems to always be centered on the determination of consent by both parties at the time of the intercourse. Refusal and consistent resistance to being penetrated would be considered as sufficient evidence that a victim did not consent to have sex. But when you state in your second premise that \"most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted (160.7.4)\" we enter a gray area of judgment. I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of nonconsenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear. What non-traditional rape standard often is unclear about and what it fails to produce is a distinctive criterion of nonconsent. Your premise of \"nontraditional rape being quite similar to what happens in many bedrooms across America (161.4.1)\" seems to reflect that very notion. If all sex is coerced in some way (161.3.1); the line between consensual and forced sex can be unknowingly crossed at any point, and lack of consent is not properly communicated, is it not possible that cases of mistaken consent could be a regular occurrence? No two people are the same, so experiences with a certain similar group of people might be our only guide about typical behavior related to that group. It is possible that a man has repeated certain type of seductive behavior with a number of women and was never made aware by any of them that his actions went too far. At that point it is possible that he has determined certain aggressive behavior as acceptable. In \"Rape\" Susan Estrich uses an example of Pat and Rusk. Pat is a young woman who met Rusk at a bar and later gave him a ride home. At one point, when she declined twice to go up, he took her car keys and she followed him to his apartment. The two proceeded to have sex. While Rusk\"s action to grab car keys might seem to be excessively forceful and without a doubt surprised Pat, at no point in his room did he say or indicate that any harm would be done to her if she doesn\"t cooperate with his wishes. His controlling demeanor and aggressive tone caused Pat to assume and articulate possible negative consequences of nonconsenting, without there really being any evidence that would suggest possibilities of bodily harm. His decision to walk Pat to her car and ask if they could meet again would further imply that he might have been unaware of any wrongdoing (171.4-172.4). What Pat and Rusk example demonstrates is how difficult it is to determine intentions in a non-traditional rape; and how any situations, depending on each party\"s position, can be a subject to different interpretations. In bride kidnapping the only real use of physical force occurs during the kidnapping itself (12min30secs-15mins40secs). Assuming the resistance is not a preplanned part of the wedding proceedings, this is the only time that the woman\"s freedom is restricted and her pleas are ignored. After the bride regains her autonomy, she seems to make a conscious decision to continue the marriage ceremonies. Since the kidnapping is the only means of physical force that was used, it seems safe to assert that physical force or threat of physical force was not a factor in the women\"s decision to marry. Therefore it is important to examine whether psychological manipulation or fear was a decisive element in the bride\"s decision. Unlike the woman in \"Rape\", who\"s unfamiliarity of the man and her surroundings led to her consenting out of fear, the bride in the video has known the groom for some extended time and was romantically involved with him (4mins 40 secs). She was fully aware that she will not experience any harm if she does not agree to marry and the video indicates that her family was aware of her location. As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress. The bride in the video, after the initial vigorous resistance, just seems to give in way too easy; and only moments after she was given her freedom back. When you reference that kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice (27.15)\", I find it hard to believe that no other alternatives were available in this situation. There is no evidence she even considered or discussed other choices and, like you stated in your argument when you wrote: Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1). Additionally, your claim that \"she understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present\" is completely subjective as far as determining the presence of a choice inhibiting fear. Her assumed resignation to her fate should more likely be attributed to her upbringing in Kyrgyzstan, rather than fear of any repercussions as a result of saying \"No\". She was more likely brought up with an instilled knowledge that in a situation like this, its proper for her to eventually agree since it is a part of a long lasting tradition (27mins09secs).', 'In her article \"Rape\" Susan Estrich analyzes various cases of rape and identifies certain, ever present, elements that categorize the act of rape in two distinct groups: traditional rape and non-traditional rape. Traditional rape is mainly related to the \"use of force\" or a clearly articulated \"threat of force\", where intentions of a perpetrator are unmistakable and there is a definite absence of mistake. Non-traditional rape differs in a way that less force or no force is used, threats are not necessarily articulated and there is a possibility of mistake regarding consent (160.7-161.1). VICE documentary, \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\", looks more closely at the local Kyrgyzstan tradition of marriage by kidnapping, where a woman is taken off the streets and ultimately convinced to marry her kidnapper. The video follows actions of a young man as he is preparing to kidnap and marry his girlfriend. While there are elements associated with this event which could be interpreted as evidential of rape, certain circumstances surrounding this particular couple structure the following argument in a way that negates an occurrence of rape. 1.) The rape is defined by judging the victim\"s response to the act of having sex (162.2.4) 2.) Defining nonconsent is difficult in cases where certain cultures find it proper for female to act nonconsensual when pursued by male, even if she is actually consenting (177.5.2). 3.) The actions of the victim need to completely and beyond a doubt express the lack of consent (164.4.2). 4.) For a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1). 5.) For rape charge to be held, it is important to prove perpetrators intent and absence of mistake about consent (163.6.3). 6.) The man has known the woman for a long time and they have both discussed a potential marriage in the future (4 mins-45 secs). 7.) The marriage by kidnapping is a tradition in Kyrgyzstan that allows women to consent to marriage while still remaining \"innocent\" and not coming off as desperate to marry (16 mins-10 secs). 8.) Getting married by kidnapping could be a part of an agreement between the bride and the groom, where kidnapping part is staged by two parties (23 mins-05 secs). 9.) The woman showed she was capable of physical and verbal resistance (12 mins-33secs) but ceased to resist and express her nonconsent when she was given back her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). 10.) While having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says \"yes\" (26 mins-53 secs). 11). It\"s customary in Kyrgyzstan to have sex on the wedding night (30 mins-35 secs). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12.) Since the bride willingly consented to marriage, the husband is not guilty of rape. Determining whether a traditional or non-traditional rape occurred is heavily based on establishing the presence of force or threat of force during or leading up to the act. The victim has to demonstrate clear, unquestionable resistance to taking part in the sexual act, either physically or verbally; or indicate that her consent is obtained through fear, where she believed not cooperating might result in a serious harm to her person. In cases of the traditional rape, where a stranger uses physical strength or weapon to overpower or completely intimidate the victim; uses threats of doing harm if she doesn\"t cooperate, and then proceeds to have intercourse with the victim, there is a very little question when it comes to the lack of consent and the resulting crime of rape (160.7.2-3). The determination becomes inherently more complex when it comes to the issue of non-traditional rape. Unlike the stranger with a weapon example, these cases might involve numerous circumstances where perpetrator and victim might have a mutual history or were engaging in the dating process. For majority of societies, romantic encounters and dating situations are characterized by an aggressive, pursuant behavior from men and passive behavior from women (161.5.2-3). For many women it is of the utmost importance to maintain an image that they do not easily engage in sexual relations; and even if they are willing to consent to intercourse, they might only communicate their intentions through subtle hints. The decision on the level of aggressiveness required in such cases will fall squarely on the male; and without clear guidance from his partner, it might be up to him to judge what constitutes acceptable behavior and what could be thought of as too forceful. If the female is too passive and unable to express her lack of consent, it is entirely possible that the male acted with an understandable notion that his partner fully consented by letting him take the charge (177.5). \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\" could illustrates that exact point. The couple has been romantically involved for some extended amount of time. They discussed the idea of marriage and were both fully aware that marriage by kidnapping is a common tradition in their culture. Union through this type of tradition was even prevalent among their nearest family members, dating couple past generations (27 mins-10 secs). The girl\"s mother admitted to actually agreeing to a marriage by kidnapping, which could indicate the physical and verbal resistance during kidnapping was only a part of marriage proceedings and not a manifestation of her lack of consent (23mins -10 secs). That notion seems to be supported by her quick submission, especially after she regained her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). Not only she stopped any form of resistance, but she seemed to be genuinely smiling while going along with the remaining proceedings. Even when given another chance to demonstrate her nonconsent and unwillingness to marry, the woman says \"yes\" when asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage. Since she agreed to be married and spend the weeding night with the groom, his actions in the video do not evidence that rape or nontraditional rape occurred.', 'When you state that \"The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from\" I believe you are missing the main point of my previous argument. The fact that rape occurs not only in the United States, but all over the world does not make the cultural importance of \"No\" means \"Yes\" philosophy in Kyrgyzstan irrelevant. I will argue that cultural connotations of that philosophy are directly relevant to the marriage by kidnapping tradition. The importance of local culture and tradition are the basis for judgment not only for the kidnapper, but also for the victim. It would be absolutely ignorant and culturally elitist to interpreted actions described in the video only from the viewpoint of an outside observer, where interpretations of the events are made strictly using one\"s own personal culture as comparison basis. While a person in United States might view the tradition of \"Bride Kidnapping\" as an unquestionable crime of rape, the culturally relevant observer might see that event as simply an everyday typical occurrence, socially valuable to Kyrgyzstan culture. Your claim that \"the law cannot protect a man because his traditions are different\" only applies when that tradition is not under the jurisdiction of that law. Indeed, the U.S law would not protect a bride kidnapper if he committed the act on U.S territory. You can\"t use the term \"law\" as something that has the exact universal meaning all over the world, because it obviously does not. What constitutes as punishment for theft in U.S might not even remotely be similar to type of punishment for the same act in other parts of the world. So when you again state: \"So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes it as a whole\" I feel you once more elected to rely on law standards not relevant to Kyrgyzstan and imposed law and social ideology discussed by Estrich, which mainly focuses on U.S law. Neither the groom nor the bride in the video is living under that set of law. The bride at no point in the video indicates that the actions taken by the groom was a violation of her person and she eventually accepts the events that unfolded as a natural occurrence, a part of her nation\"s tradition. She is initially upset for the way she was taken but that initial struggle is quickly replaced by realization that she is participating in that tradition, at which point she is willingly accepting the notion of getting married (27mins09 secs). In conclusion, I believe it is unreasonable to judge the young men in the video as a person who committed an act of rape. The use of force illustrated in the video and demonstrative lack of consent by the kidnapped woman was no longer relevant at the moment when the bride willingly agreed to become his wife. Even the initial harm done to her during the process of kidnapping was eventually interpreted by her as way of following the local tradition. The required in the crime of rape guilty intent was not present at any point during the act, from the moment of kidnapping to the wedding ceremony; everyone involved, including the bride, believed that following the tradition absolved him from anything that could be judged as intentional wrongdoing. If an argument could be made here, it is for the abandonment of the tradition itself on the moral basis, but the actions taken by the groom in the video do not evidence that a Rape of nontraditional rape occurred.', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 3 The following claims that you have made directly prove my argument. \"I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of non - consenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear.\" and \"As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress.\" It is exactly statements such as these that show the bride was pressured so severely that her mindset transformed into the idea that if she agrees; what follows would be the termination of the pressure and convincing from all of the woman that have surrounded her. Furthermore she understood through her tradition that these events of convincing can take minutes, hours, or even days, so it has been established that these convincing ceremonies could be endless. A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) The following claim that you have made is irrelevant because the \"amount of time\" need not be specified in order to constitute grounds of rape. \"The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. \" It is legitimate to punish the man who chooses to ignore explicitly the words of protestation coming from that woman. With quite certainty if is safe and necessary to say that \"many women who say yes \" whether on dates or on the job \" would say no if they could ; I have no doubt that women\"s silence is sometimes the product not of passion and desire , but of pressure and pain.\" (181.1.1-2) Most importantly the amount of time that has passed between the kidnapping and the actual act of intercourse; is not basis to exculpate the kidnapper. At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 2 Your premise number four has proved exactly my point on the undeniable accusation that the kidnapper has performed an act of rape. Your premise goes as follows: for a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1) It is exactly through manipulation and fear of force that the kidnapee agreed to the marriage. The bride to be confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she had no other choice but to stay and therefore agreed to the marriage. (27.5) This demonstrates the idea that women often feels that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) Further more the standard of physical force, or threat of it, to constitute sex as rape give men an easy opportunity to claim that from what they understood; the women gives consent to the act. (164.3.1) This demonstrates clearly that the bride to be had no choice but to say yes and agreed to the marriage on the grounds that she completely lacked power in any other choice. She understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present. \"From a woman\"s point of view , the danger in this position where women -might in fact find themselves in a situation where they in saying yes really mean no- is that many women who say yes are in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say no.\" (177.5.1) Next, your tenth premise can be easily challenged. You have made a claim that \"while having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says yes\"(26.53) It is absolutely outrageous to somehow make out that this woman in the video was considered of her autonomy in any respect. If her autonomy was respected, first off she would not need to have been kidnapped in order for her to agree to a marriage with this kidnapper. The fact that the actual sex took place after the marriage is completely irrelevant because the sequence of events that led up to that night have stripped this woman completely of her autonomy, therefore leaving her no choice but to follow along with this situation which has consumed her. For the central role of consent, the justification in the law of rape is that it protects a woman\"s choice the autonomy of a woman in relations to sex. (175.4.1) Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) The following statements which have come directly from the video, reveal that the autonomy of the all the women was not considered in any of the following scenes: \"Father of groom states \"Be careful not to let her run away.\" (2.25) \"While a random bride is being dragged into the apartment she is pleading\" she does not want to stay and please let her go\" (2.51) \"There was a situation of a man and a woman who were in love, the woman wanted to marry him, but she explicitly explained that she did not want to be kidnapped and didn\\'t want to partake in anything following the kidnapping which and almost all cases consist of consummating the marriage. (3.14) \"After several years of marriage a couple is asked to reflect on the events that brought them together. The husband admits that when he met her he asked whether or not to send his parents for work or should he just kidnapped her right on the spot? and her response was \"don\\'t do it\" (3.58) \"When the male and all his friends went to retrieve his bride the young man states \"you can beat us or even cry\" they then proceed while the woman screams out to her mother as she kicks and screams. (12.39) \"Bride confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she have no other choice but to stay and agreed to the marriage. (27.5)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 1 Author Patricia Smith makes it clear on what grounds and individual should be convicted of rape and she works beyond basic ideologies to show that rape in fact has occurred in some situations where it would be easy to think otherwise. Patricia Smith provides evidence to show that the kidnapper in the video in fact is guilty of rape. Most importantly she recognizes the distinction between negligence and purposefulness but stands firm that it is quite irrelevant to establish which of the two it is when convicting an individual of rape. She claims as follows: 1)In society both men and women have gotten used to the norms of male aggressiveness and female passivity. (161.5.2) 2)Most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted. (160.7.4) 3)Rape is not the only crime where the relationship before the crime took place between the characters is considered by prosecutors in screening the case, but it has yet to be questioned whether or not considering the prior relationship in rape cases is less justifiable or different than considering it in an assault case. (160.2.4) 4)At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4) 5)Practically all jurisdictions have adopted \"force\" or \"threat of force\" grounds to which determined a rape has occurred. (167.5.1) 6)The central role of consent in the law of rape exists to protect a women\"s autonomy and a women\"s choice in the case of sexual relations. (175.4.1) 7)Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) 8)Kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice.\" (27.15) 9)When Bride is asked how she feels at the moment she explains how she wanted to cry earlier but now she is extremely tired. (26.27) 10)\"Understandably some men in our society have honestly believed in a different reality of sexual relations and that many may honestly view such situations differently than woman. But it is precisely because men and woman may perceive these situations differently and because the injury to woman stemming from the different male perception may be grave that it is necessary and appropriate for the law to impose a duty upon the men to act with reason and to punish them when they violate that duty.\" (166.6.2) 11)The conduct a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) 12)\"So, too, for threats of harm short of physical injury and for the deception and the false pretenses as methods of seduction. The powerlessness of women and the value of bodily integrity are great enough to argue that women deserve more comprehensive protection for their bodies than the laws of extortion or fraud provide for money.\" (181.2.1) 13)Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) 14)Some feminists have argued that there needs to be a political revolution in order to counteract the traditional approach to rape, which is a failure. Unfortunately in most cases what passes as sex in our society, is in reality coerced. There cannot be any distinction between rape and what occurs in many bedrooms across our country. (161.3.2) 15)\"If in 1986 silence does not negate consent, at least crying and saying no should.\"(161.5.6) 16)A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable. (163.6.2) 17)A negligent rapist is still a rapist and should be punished. It is justifiable that knowledge of the risk is sufficient enough to determine blame. (165.5.1-2) _______________________________________________________________________ 18)The kidnapper is guilty of rape. Although this kidnapper seems to have overcome the female where she feels she has no choice but to go along with his plan; that does not provide legitimate means to prove that he is not guilty of rape.', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 4 When you say this: \"Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).\" you are further proving my point as to why the law should address all areas as well as all individuals with the same respect. The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from. Because of the traditions there, the society is more patriarchal therefore often times favoring the men in the criminal law. This does not necessarily mean that rape has not taken place.\"Most of the time, a criminal law that reflects male views and male standards imposes its judgment on men who have injured other men. It is boys rules applied to a boys fight. In rape the male standard defines a crime committed against woman, and the male standards are used not only to judge men but also to judge the conduct of woman victims. Moreover, because the crime involves sex itself, the law of rape inevitably threads on the explosive ground of sex roles, of male aggression and female passivity, of our understandings of sexuality \" areas where differences between male and female perspective may be most pronounced.\" (160.4.4-7) Rape cases almost entirely disregard the defendant, and focus on the behavior of the victim, which is based on a male standard of what is appropriate behavior of a woman. (162.2-3) \"The study of rape as an illustration of sexism in the criminal law also raises broader questions about the way conceptions of gender and the different backgrounds and perspectives of man and woman are encompassed within the criminal law.\" (160.4.1) So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes as a whole. If one individual murders another one what follows is necessary punishment regardless of what region you are from. The same concept should be applied to rape. One cannot be punished differently or not even accused of a crime which would have different circumstances in the for example the United States or any other progressive region. The conduct of a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable. (163.6.2)', 'When mentioning Long beach, California, I wasn\\'t contrasting it from other states. I was simply explaining the impact that school uniforms potentially had on a neighborhood. Secondly, abuse and discipline are two different things. Although some people may argue that it is a form of discipline, abuse does not necessarily correspond with it. As you stated, \"depression and PTSD are some of the long term effects when discipline becomes abuse\", shows that abuse is the reason of the depression and not the discipline itself. Ask yourself, would you discipline your children? Or would you let them tell you what they want to wear because their friends are all wearing it. If you think about it they wear a uniform whether it\\'s identical or not.', \"There is no way to show that conformity at a young age, elementary school and some high schools, would make children machines. Discipline is important at an early age in a child's life. Without Discipline, children will grow up not knowing how to face certain obstacles. Then there is also the the respect factor, without discipline it can be said that there will not be respect for others. According to lbschools.net, Schools where uniforms are required have seen a 95 percent decrease in crime, 90 percent decrease in suspensions, and vandalism on school property decreased by 69 percent. Also in Long Beach, California, where school uniforms are required almost everywhere since 1995, the average cost of uniforms per year is roughly $60 to $70.\", 'School uniforms help schools portray discipline. It keeps schools somewhat in check. Usually public schooling doesn\\'t require uniforms, some do, while catholic schools try to keep a uniform a requirement. According to Statisticbrain.com, Parents spend roughly 1.3 billion dollars annually on school uniforms, which breaks down to about 249 dollars per parent per year. That would be much cheaper than trying to get the newest clothing per year and spending money so that the child can have a new outfit of the \"coolest styles\" each day. School uniforms also try to keep the school itself united. The uniforms help diminish economic and social barriers between students. (greatschools.org)', 'To properly conclude, the speaker has brought many valuable points to the discussion. However, these methods are not always sound. To begin, the speaker compares to Long Beach, California, even though it has a higher per capita murder rate of 7.4% to 5.1% of NYC (baruch.cuny.edu). Clearly, this should not be possible with lbschools.net, boasting a 90% decrease. Frankly, it seems like inflated numbers, using a small sample space to predict the population, instead of using larger ones. Regarding disciple, \"Depression and PTSD are some of the long-term effects when discipline becomes abuse\" (CNN.com). To have much of it, regardless of corporal or not, is not useful. Nevertheless, this was a wonderful debate that yielded many valid solutions.', \"As the speaker may have valuable points such as discipline, it still causes horrendous conformity. Simply put, conformity and discipline is like the military; such an act on small children in early education makes them machines. With Syria, that worn torn country has emboldened students with their blue uniforms (washingtontimes.com). Clearly, this is contradictory to “land of free.” To add, it apparently “[interferes] students' right to choose their dress…[Violating] First Amendment rights (Mitchell and Knechtle, 2003).” Thus, apparently this is militarization and constitutional infringement. With finance, parents should know how to spend wisely; if they afford new “kicks” every season, they certainly can afford at least 7 pairs of clothes.\", 'School uniforms, in general, seem to stretch the notion of assertion over students. There may be advantages with respect to fashion conservation, but it still destroys the concept of independence and art. In reality, wearing such uniforms brings a relatively stable nation like America, more like that of Syria, where uniforms are required by students, as well as longer class days (everyculture.com). If there is not a decrease in student morality, then certainly there can be one in their artistic flare. As the sun-sentinel.com suggests, wearing “uniforms stifle creativity” implying that to be creative proposes to not wear them in the first place (material conditional then modus tollens). While they may have their benefits, they harm far more.', 'Yes everyone can agree that animals are not evil because they do not have a higher intelligence to think about that, and we can agree that natural disasters can be considered not evil since they are not a alive thing with any form of intelligence. I would think that evil would lie with humans. And yes what is evil may be subjective in the form of small things like animals I am talking big league when it comes to evil. For example, Hitler is evil his motives may seem good at first however in the end his motives was because he was a selfish dick who wanted more than he had and he died from it, of course before his death he killed 11 MILLION people you can not justify that as good. That was plain and simple evil', 'I look forward to what you have to say', 'You say that evil does not exist from the points you made so this is what I will do. Lets see what you said There is no objective evil? Not true the best example I have ever heard for evil is, evil for evils sake, which means no ending purpose, just for the hell of it Like I said with the one above there is a direct point of view of evil IT does not change what people think of it does, again you have to look at it objectively which most people can not do You can infact measure evil, here is a article I found with what most would consider a accurate scale about evil http://www.npr.org... So for my final thing I just want to say, everyone can agree that good exist in the world yes? then you believe in evil and the reason why is because for good to exist there needs to be a opposite so we can know the difference. Like for light to exist then dark has to, it is the same principle. That is why evil does exist', \"But that's thing thing Hitler did not do it because he thought it was best, he did it because he thought that he and all who looked similar to him was better than everyone else. Yes the mass populace may say that this is bad and that is bad but you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad .For example in the holocaust Hitler killed more than Jews he killed EVERYONE that was not a perfect arion which is why it was evil he did not do it for the best of Germany he did it because he wanted to and he thought he was better and that arions were better, so saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\", 'the Google definition of evil is \" profoundly immoral and malevolent\" and exist as \"have objective reality or being\" Evil is an idea that can not exist in the real world The idea of evil by its nature is subjective. You may think an action is evil but another person may claim it is good. For example one may believe that killing any living thing is evil, where others may say that killing animals is just part of life. Here are some questions than may arise. Who\\'s beliefs are correct? and what if killing one things saves five others? Is an evil action always evil or can exceptions be made? and finally how gets the right to answer these questions? so evil is clearly not objective I also want to talk about volition. Most people would agree that killing is immoral. An earthquake may kill people but an earthquake is not malevolent, it has no will to kill people. Most would agree that an earthquake is not evil it has no freewill. Say some is killed by an animal for food is that animal evil? It is just following its instincts it did not relay have an active choice in the madder. People also follow there instincts and there brain reacts to outside stimulus. so if the brain controls peoples actions, and has no power over the outside world can they relay be evil or act evilly? I would say no. I also want to say morals change with time, and what one group thinks is immoral another might have no issue with, so I ask can something be evil today and not be evil in say 100 years? There is no way to measure or quantify evil, and there are a lot of grey areas about what is and is not considered evil. this lack of agreement shows the frail nature of the idea of evil, and its inability to exist in the world.', 'A short debate with 3000 characters per round.', 'You have yet to convince me that evil exist and I think I have made some compiling arguments against the idea of evil.I want to quickly comment on some of your last points You say Hitler did not think it was for the best, he do it because he thought aryans where better than everyone else, but those are not exclusive he could think and did think both. He wanted to have the people he thought where best to run things because if they where the best, giving them power would be for the best. Hitler also was not aryan, so he clearly was just not thinking about himself. Also on that point just because it was not best for Germany does not mean he did not think it was best for Germany.You said \"you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad\" I agree with the sentiment, but since there is no objective bad, nothing can be called really bad. This idea also works for evil, since there is no objective evil there is nothing that is truly bad.The final thing I will say on your points, you said \"saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\" with this you are not wrong I would say a serial is not evil same as I would not call Hitler evil. more so in the case of serial killers, many of whom have mental disorders. I would say in cases of serial killers with a disorder it is not to different from the animal killing people, and we agreed that the animal is not evil.To bring it all together, evil is not real because1 There is no objective evil 2 Ideas of evil change and vary -This is why people who kill like Hitler are not evil, but we can agree it is tragic that the people where killed. 3 It can not be measured or Quantified', \"First I would agree that what happened to the Jews in W.W.2 was tragic, and that Hitler played a huge role in that tragedy and is an undesirable human. However that does not mean that he is evil. He did what he thought was best for himself and Germany, so I argue this does not prove evil exists. I want to make a more abstract example, say there is an election, I think candidate A's views are immoral and and bad for the country, but that does not make him evil. I have my right to think candidate A is immoral but it does not make him immoral. The lack of evil does not mean that people still can't think this or that about anything. One could even think that someone is evil, but it does not make it so, same as one thinking the world is flat makes the world flat. I want to comment that just because something is not good that does not mean it is evil. Good is also very subjective and what is good for the majority may not be good for the minority and vice versa.\", 'I fully welcome my opponent\\'s unconventionality, and shall follow suit. Since my opponent has not justified his framework, not has he made positive arguments generally (as opposed to assertions), I am free to do the same. I will, in this round, present two arguments, each negating the resolution, based on two contrary assumptions (the first, that a constitution may have authority extended through time, and, the second, that a constitution cannot), such that, no matter what my opponent makes of the framework in which I am working, my conclusion is inevitable. Note that this is in direct opposition to my opponent’s unwarranted decree that “Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed” – I must only argue that it should not be a living document (which includes an utterly impotent, and, therefore, de facto nonexistent constitution). I do not challenge my opponent’s acceptance of “natural rights”, but the exact list of rights he is accepting must be clarified before discourse may be had. So that there exists no ambiguity, I will operate with the assumption that the primary right is the Right to Autonomy, which has corollaries: the Right to Property and the Right to Self-Ownership. The Right to Autonomy states, generally, that each man has the right to exercise their own free will; the Right to Property that each man has the right to act exclusively over unclaimed material or material within his domain (this right also establishes the right to domain); the Right to Self-Ownership that each man must be treated as property of only themselves (unless they sign themselves into slavery), which, as explained, implies that they have exclusive control over their own person. If my opponent wishes to challenge any of these rights, I will present their justifications. The way my case is constructed means that, if my opponent cannot show that the Constitution is not “dead”, then it does not and should not have authority. Therefore, many of my opponent’s arguments work towards my conclusion. To give the foundation of my argument, I present passages from Lysander Spooner’s No Treason/Constitution of No Authority. Quoting the noble man on why Constitutions bind only those who signed them, and only on the terms that they signed them under: “Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but “the people” then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves. Let us see. Its language is: “We, the people of the United States (that is, the people then existing in the United States), in order to form a more perfect union, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” It is plain, in the first place, that this language, as an agreement, purports to be only what it at most really was, viz., a contract between the people then existing; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those then existing. In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies that they had any right or power, to bind their “posterity” to live under it. It does not say that their “posterity” will, shall, or must live under it. It only says, in effect, that their hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to their posterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety, tranquility, liberty, etc.” And on why those bound by it must have signed it of their own accords: “The laws holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed, the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to sign it, or to bind himself by it. [...] Neither law nor reason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, until it is written; for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning. And when it is written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its precise legal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he will agree to it or not. And if he do not THEN sign it, his reason is supposed to be, that he does not choose to enter into such a contract. The fact that the instrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it, goes for nothing. Where would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring into court a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have it enforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that this other man had promised to sign it? [...] The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority from the Constitution — from an instrument that nobody ever signed — would spurn any other instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them for adjudication. […] Moreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, but must also be delivered to the party (or to some one for him), in whose favor it is made, before it can bind the party making it. The signing is of no effect, unless the instrument be also delivered. […] The Constitution was not only never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody, or to anybody\\'s agent or attorney. It can therefore be of no more validity as a contract, then can any other instrument that was never signed or delivered.” [2] Prong the First: If a Constitution is to Have Authority, it Must Not Change This is obvious by the fact that a contract is binding only insofar as it was consented to, and that “progress”, no matter to what end, would obliterate the ability for the terms of a contract to be specified (and therefore it could not be agreed to – empty and tabula rasa contracts are not contracts). Prong the Second: If a Constitution Changes, and Therefore Has No Authority, it Must be Discarded My opponent’s arguments mostly reject the consistency of our Constitution, and, therefore, we move to this prong. This conclusion is clearly given when one accepts that an improper contract is not binding; therefore, my opponent has shown that a living Constitution would be impotent, and, therefore, neither practically nor morally desirable. In addition, my opponent must recognise the difference between holding that a specific Constitution, by definition enduring, should be living, and that morally bankrupt Constitutions should be destroyed and replaced by More Perfect ones, and, if such replacement is impossible, just destroyed. My opponent needs to justify why the first would have been morally superior for, for example, Rome.', 'I accept.', 'what a clown', 'On Framework Note, here, that my opponent claims to have accepted my list of rights. Afterwards, he argues against the primacy of autonomy (saying that it must be compromised in the advance of something “greater”). He must have been very confused; there is no other explanation for this massive lapse in understanding. I specifically noted that the Right to Autonomy was the “primary right”, and other rights were corollaries. Given that my opponent has still presented no justification for his framework except for saying, descriptively, that certain things are “just” or “respectful of dignity” (which my opponent seems to believe counts as proving it so), there is absolutely no reason to accept the “appended” rights he tries to tack onto my own framework. Indeed, the very fact that he ACCEPTS my framework and then argues against its fundamental nature should be enough to discredit his attempts at consistency. The question one must first ask in this debate is \"By what standard am I to pass moral judgement?” I pose one simple challenge to both my opponent and the reader: find any answer which does not, at least implicitly, require autonomy of the Will. You will find that you cannot. This being so, it is clear that, unless my opponent decides to finally offer a positive argument, my a priori true position must be accepted prima facie. Defence1. Consent of the Governed Quoting Ayn Rand: “A right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone’s permission. If you exist only because society permits you to exist—you have no right to your own life. A permission can be revoked at any time. If, before undertaking some action, you must obtain the permission of society—you are not free, whether such permission is granted to you or not. Only a slave acts on permission. A permission is not a right.” It should be clear that I am not arguing that justice is “up to a vote”, or whatever other ridiculous position my opponent wishes to paint me as holding; justice is the protection of consensual relations and the destruction of all others. This is much different – justice is not “majority rules” or arbitrary under my theory, but, rather, justice itself is the principle of free association with the world and others. This is why my opponent’s rant about how “What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people“ falls flat; that which professes to protect rights cannot itself be a slavemaster. Thus, my opponent’s strawman is burnt to a crisp. The point made by my opponent about “practicality” is also worthless; is the unjust, then, to become just because it is expedient? I see no reason why one cannot consent to everything done to them; my opponent has a totally unjustified pessimism towards freedom. Also, I do fully believe that starving is oftentimes consensual. I have no problem biting the bullet; it’s your job to show why I’m wrong even if I do get around your silly reductios. Moving to another of my opponent’s scattered chains of twisted logic, he takes for granted that doing “beneficial” things is never unjust. This, while literally true, attempts to smuggle something past the reader: it assumes that non-beneficial actions actually are, in order to prove their moral acceptability. This is a ruse. He says himself that the reason the theft of the apple is a crime is the absence of consent. There are no two ways about this: Pro has unequivacly conceded that a possible distinguishing factor of a criminal act, as opposed to any other act, is a lack of consent. This, in itself, torpedoes the argument that consensual action is not an end in itself (and also the idea that “kind things” are always just). If that done without consent is criminal (and therefore unjust), and benevolent actions are always just, nonconsensual actions must always be unbeneficial. Q.E.D. I leave you with this unjustified, out-of-context segment of Robert Nozick (Anarchy, State, and Utopia is very relevant here) that should, in itself, be just as weighty as my opponent’s unjustified, out of context segments of Dworkin, and far weightier when taking into account my positive arguments for my framework: “Political philosophy is concerned only with certain ways that persons may not use others; primarily, physically aggressing against them, A specific side constraint upon action toward others expresses the fact that others may not be used in the specific ways the side constraint excludes, Side constraints express the inviolability of others, in the ways they specify, These modes of inviolability are expressed by the following injunction: \\'Don\\'t use people in specified ways,\\' An end-state view, on the other hand. would express the view that people are ends and not merely means (if it chooses to express this view at all), by a different injunction: \\'Minimize the use in specified ways of persons as means.\\' Following this precept itself may involve using someone as a means in one of the ways specified, Had Kant held this view, he would have given the second formula of the categorical imperative as, \\'So act as to minimize the use of humanity simply as a means,\\' rather than the one he actually used: \\'Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end. Side constraints express the inviolability of other persons, But why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm: we go to the dentist to avoid worse suffering later; we do some unpleasant work for its results; some persons diet to improve their health or looks; some save money to support themselves when they are older. In each case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall good, Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good? But there is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to him for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this up. (Intentionally?) To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has. He does not get some overbalancing good from his sacrifice, and no one is entitled to force this upon him-least of all a state or government that claims his allegiance (as other individuals do not) and that therefore scrupulously must be neutral between its citizens.\"2. Rome (An Exercise in Inconsequentialism) My opponent makes the rather unconvincing argument that, had the Romans made a new Constitution, it would likely itself have been in opposition to liberty, and thus the proper thing to do is not to make a new Constitution. The problem is obvious: I did not advocate for the creation of any Constitution, only a Constitution of a certain… constitution. Unless my opponent is fully committed to the idea that it is physically and logically impossible that such a Constitution be created, he must admit that it is possible, and thus relevant to the moral discourse. If this is done, it is clear that, of the choices, a new and truly just Constitution would be the obvious best. In conclusion, I wish the reader to keep in mind that my opponent constantly appeals to dignity. I ask: What is more dignified? Self-determination or subjugation? To quote, again, Senpai Nozick: “The minimal state treats us as inviolate individuals, who may not be used in certain ways by others as means or tools or instruments or resources; it treats us as persons having individual right with the dignity this constitutes. Treating us with respect by respecting our rights, it allows us, individually or with whom we please, to choose our life and to realize our ends and our conception of ourselves, insofar as we can, aided by the voluntary cooperation of other individuals possessing the same dignity. How dare any state or group of individuals do more. Or less.”', 'Thanks to Shab for accepting this battle to the death debate.Untraditionally, I will not be laying out a framework for this debate yet. Instead, I am merely going to present facts this round, which I will use to make my case in the next round. Assume that my framework is natural rights; if Con doesn\\'t contest, this is the framework we will use. Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed. Accordingly, these facts I present will be used in the next round to accomplish two objectives: 1) to show that the Constitution should be living, and 2) to show that the Constitution should not be dead. Because it can only be one or the other, judges should treat both types of arguments as positive arguments that advance my case. How the Founders Intended It?Significant hullabaloo is raised by some in defending the \"original\" Constitution. However, the Constitution from its inception was actually intended to be a living document, according to a significant number of its creators and ratifiers. The Constitution was not a coherent statement of ideology, outside of certain vague commitments to liberty. It was the product of compromise (1). Specifically, the compromise was between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists would find camaraderie among the originalists today. The Federalists included John Marshall, a delegate to the Virginia convention to ratify the Constitution, and the fourth Supreme Court justice, responsible for the creation of judicial review (2). It is important to note that judicial review stems from no explicit constitutional authority authority whatsoever--it is truly one of the first and most famous examples of the living constitution, far before the phrase was coined. We can indeed see this same evidence of two interpretations of the constitution in the debate over the Repeal Act in 1803--\"[T]he Federalists urged that the constitutionality of the Repeal Act be referred to the Supreme Court. The Republicans responded that the people, not the courts, were the judges of the constitutionality of acts of Congress\" (2, pg. 313). Furthermore, \"Only 11 of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention, according to Madison\\'s notes, expressed an opinion on the desirability of judicial review. Of those that did so, nine generally supported the idea and two opposed\" (3) We\\'ll return to Justice Marshall later, but for now it is enough to say that originalism was not the doctrine of the Founders. I will explain the importance of this in Round 2. Judicial Review--In Defense of Liberty The GPO has published a handy-dandy list of things deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (4). Of particular note are cases 150, 144, 140, and 133. I will not use them now, but I have acknowledged that as a courtesy to my opponent. The fundamental fact about rights is that, by definition, they cannot be subjected to a vote. Either they exist, or they do not exist, and woe be to the positivist that ascribes only the \"rights\" they like to the people they like--if rights are mutable, they are not rights. A dead constitution necessarily entails that we rewind our conceptions of rights, and of morality, to an earlier, worse time. More than just judicial review, the living constitution approach ensures that the Constitution is a document worthy of respect. The law is not an end, it is a means to the end of the public good. There is no quality of law that gives it an intrinsic utility or moral worth. Even the law of a religious society with religious law is worthless if the law is not followed. To the extent that the law protects the public welfare, it is worthy of praise; to the extent that it damages the public welfare, it is worthy of scorn. One of the great successes of the Living Constitution recently has been Obergefell v. Hodges. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down bans on gay marriage because of the Due Process and Equal Process clauses (5). Both clauses clearly were not meant to apply to gay marriage, and it is doubtful the Founders would have supported gay marriage. Yet, because of the actions of the Supreme Court, gay marriage is legal, and it is guaranteed to remain legal. No legislature can change that. The Living Constitution approach has successfully ensured that the Constitution remains a document worthy of respect that preserves the rights of the people. Rome Quite the segue, eh? This section demonstrates the harm caused when constitutions--in this case, the unwritten Roman Constitution--are insufficient to provide for the people. The beginning of the end of the Roman Republic is generally traced to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus (6, pg. 144). Rome was in dire straits. The poor filled the streets of Rome, and wealth continued to be concentrated in the hands of a few (pg. 145). Tiberius pushed for land reform. Tribunes, as it happened, all had the power to unilaterally veto any proposal, and one by the name of Marcus Octavius did just that (146-147). The common people wanted reform (147). The law was intransigent. The natural response? Tiberius convinced the assembly to eject Octavius from office, a step with no legal precedent (147). For his trouble, Tiberius was murdered by the pontifex maximus and a mob of senators and retainers (147). This set the stage for enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic. A dead constitution goes the way of the optimates--into extinction and irrelevance. It can preserve no freedom in the long run, because it preserves only itself. A living constitution, on the other hand, would have bypassed many of the problems traditionalist Rome had with the populares. It would have enabled Tiberius and others to enact the will of the majority while preserving the rest of the Roman institutions. Attempting reforms under a dead constitution is like attempting a surgery with a battleaxe. You\\'ll get the problem area cut out just fine--and a few other vital organs while you\\'re at it. The scalpel of the living constitution is necessary to preserve this stability.ConclusionIn this round, I demonstrated several strengths of a living constitution, and provided necessary historical context for understanding my case. A living constitution more effectively protects liberties, more effectively allows for reform, and was favored by a good number of the Founders.Sources http://law2.umkc.edu...

The Romans: From Village to Empire by Boatwright et al.', 'Other than that, everything (excluding blatantly anti-debate practices like Google Doc links to avoid the character limit) is fair game. Definitions\"Should\" implies moral desirability. A \"living constitution\" is one that \" . . . changes over time, and adapts to new circumstances, without being formally amended\" (1). Generally, this interpretation is opposed to originalism, which states that \"those who make, interpret, and enforce the law ought to be guided by the meaning of the United States Constitution—the supreme law of the land—as it was originally written\" (2).

Hopefully we can do this again some time--I have some major fixes I made to my argument and I've learned not doing arguments in the first round was a poor strategy, lol.GG WP\", 'I accept Con\\'s list of rights, but I will also add a list of my own. The exhaustive list of rights is everything that is necessary to provide equal respect and concern for all citizens. According to Ronald Dworkin (Justice for Hedgehogs), \"Someone\\'s total freedom is his power to act in whatever way he might wish, unimpeded by constraints or threats . . . His negative liberty is the area of his freedom that a political community cannot take away without injuring him in a special way . . .\" (366). The distinction between the two is important. Borrowing from a secondary source,Dworkin believes that a right to liberty in general is too vague to be meaningful. However, certain specific liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of worship, rights of association, and of personal and sexual relations, do require special protection against governmental interference. This is not because these preferred liberties have some special substantive or inherent value (as most rights philosophers hold), but because of a kind of procedural impediment that these preferred liberties might face. The impediment is that if those liberties were left to a utilitarian calculation, that is, an unrestricted calculation of the general interest, the balance would be tipped in favor of restrictions. . . . Dworkin says that if a vote were truly utilitarian, then all voters would desire the liberties for themselves, and the liberties would be protected under a utilitarian calculation. However, a vote on these liberties would not be truly utilitarian nor would it afford equal concern about and respect for liberties solely by reflecting personal wants or satisfactions of individuals and affording equal concerns to others . . . because [of] external preferences, such as prejudice and discrimination against other individuals deriving from the failure to generally treat other persons as equals . . . These external preferences would corrupt utilitarianism by causing the individual to vote against assigning liberties to others. Accordingly, the liberties that must be protected against such external preferences must be given a preferred status. By doing so, society can protect the fundamental right of citizens to equal concern and respect because it prohibits \"decisions that seem, antecedently, likely to have been reached by virtue of the external components of the preferences democracy reveals.\" (The Philosophic Foundations of Human Rights, Jerome Shestack, Human Rights Quarterly 20.2: 201-234) Con\\'s first point deals with liberty of contract. His argument basically boils down to the \"Contract? I never signed a contract!\" shtick, and you shouldn\\'t buy it for a number of reasons. First, the principle that liberty is inviolable overrides consent--in other words, rights cannot be subjected to a vote, for the simple reason that if they can be revoked by a simple majority vote, they aren\\'t really rights. Second, consent of the governed is not valuable as an end, but a means to an end. Suppose a woman opposes restrictions on abortion until fetal viability, but the state they reside in institutes waiting periods, requires consent of parents/the court, etc. They did not consent to those restrictions being placed upon people. Even if she are in the government itself, it cannot be said that the women \"consented\" to such restrictions. The sense of consent that Con uses is this broad sense, in which every person must consent to every single law they live under and every condition that would potentially infringe on their freedom, and it is a total fantasy--there is zero possibility of ever achieving broad consent like that. Even in the state of nature, the fantasy land where everyone voluntarily consents to contracts, Con cannot pretend that people \"consent\" to starvation, for instance. If we accept that consent of the governed is thus not a right, then we have destroyed our own framework that we agreed to. The only solution is to change the way we view our terms. If I have an apple, for instance, and a thief takes it without my permission, what is the crime? The crime in itself cannot be my lack of consent; the crime is the theft of the apple, and the lack of consent is why it is a crime. However, say a random stranger, in an act of kindness, slips $20 into my coat. I did not consent to that, but was any crime committed? After all, I did not consent to this action performed on me. Consent of the governed is a means to the end of the protection of liberty--it is not an end in itself. It does not matter that Americans today did not sign the Constitution. If one were to sign a regular contract, ignorant of some of the provisions, and it turns out that those provisions are actually favorable to the ignorant person, there is no injustice. What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people. As Dworkin notes, \" . . . a collective decision to impose a duty not to kill and to threaten a serious sanction for any violation is in itself an insult to the dignity of subjects. On the contrary, your dignity as an equal citizen requires that government protect you in this way. It is not demeaning . . . to accept that a majority of your fellow citizens has the right to fix traffic rules and enforce the rules they fix, provided that the rules . . . are not wicked or desperately foolish\" (Dworkin 367). With this in mind, we must devise a different analysis from what Con has suggested. The measure of any governmental system is not whether it is completely consensual, but whether it is just, and by extension, whether it protects individual liberties. Con\\'s argument is wholly based on contract language, which I have debunked, but his alternatives seem to be meaningless when it comes to protecting liberty--destroying and replacing Constitutions in itself carries no inherent procedural benefit. A Living Constitution does. As Dworkin noted, democratic utilitarian calculations and votes on rights are inherently unjust because of discrimination against others, so the rights cannot be put to a vote. They must be protected by an independent institution--the Supreme Court. Rehashing constitutions every few years or abolishing the constitution is merely a more complicated form of the tyranny of the majority. Extend Obergefell v. Hodges as an example of protection of rights thanks to the Living Constitution. Extend judicial review as another example. Since Con asked me to justify why a living constitution would be superior to a new constitution in Rome, I\\'ll respond to that. The reason is as simple as that a new constitution was impossible to create. As I said last round, there was \"enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic.\" Had new constitutions been made, they would have inevitably slanted toward the more-numerous populares, who were the epitome of majoritarian, as evidenced by the many mobs that they formed to kill political leaders and kick people out of the Senate and all sorts of other fun things (sarcasm).

In 2013, phones and such technology was just being beginning to evolve into what it is today. Today, technology has become more incorporated in our daily routines which is why, as stated by Julie Luhrsen, one of the attorneys of Luhrsen Goldberg Attorneys At Law in 2017, \"People who use their cell phones to talk or text while driving are by far the most common reason for distracted driving accidents. In fact, the National Safety Council estimates that 26% of all car crashes involve cell phones\".

Luhrsen did state this but my opponent failed to incorporate the rest of Luhrsen\\'s statement, \"...cell phones to talk or text while driving are by far the most common reason for distracted driving accidents\". This validates my claim that texting and driving should not be allowed or in other words, people should not text and drive, because it creates a major distraction to the driver and not only puts their own life at risk but of those around them.

As stated by the Los Angeles DUI Law Office, \"...texting is the biggest distraction we face today and that it is six times more dangerous than drinking and driving. To add, according to the Brain Injury Society, \"Drivers who are texting while behind the wheel have a 23% higher chance of causing a crash. That is equivalent to downing four beers and getting behind the wheel\".

While cell phone use did cause 12% of fatal car accidents, it is far less than the most frequent cause, daydreaming. Texting while driving is also not the only distraction a driver way face when behind the wheel. According to Julie Luhrson, an injury defense attorney, stated in her 2017 article, drivers can be distracted by numerous causes such as noisy children, GPS, and music.

Texting is also quicker than talking on the phone. According to T.

Voters should also take into account the logic and reasoning behind each of our arguments, our gift of persuasion and articulation, and the overall presentation of our ideas to support our claim. With that being said, I would like to point out that not only have I refuted each and every one of my opponents main points, but also provided a sufficient and succesful rebuttal to actually prove him wrong, or at least put a spin on his point to show that in fact his argument really does support the notion that basketball is in fact better than basbeall. Thus in my conclusion I will provide a re-cap of these examples, as well as include a brief summation of the additional points that I have made to which my opponent failed to prove me wrong. Here we go... 1. My opponent argued that baseball was the better team sport, because it put more emphasis on individual success and therefore pressure to perform at one\\'s best, and then collectively add up each teammate\\'s contribution... or something. I replied by reminding him that a team sport is and should not be about individual performance, but rather working together towards a collaborative goal. Win: Me 2. My challenger attempted to argue that a slower paced sport is preferable over a fast paced game; not only do I disagree (as it is, afterall, a matter of opinion) but I trumped his argument by reminding him that with basketball you have more leeway in determining the tempo of the game, whereas with baseball there\\'s really not much you can do to speed up each individual play Win: Me 3. My opponent agreed that baseball and basketball are both equally easy to learn and accessible to play. However I then won this argument by pointing out the fact that baseball players have to invest in gloves or mitts, while basketball players only have to utilize the two \"hoops\" and one (less easy to lose) ball. Win: Me 4. Pro contends that baseball is a better sport than basketball because it provides less room for injury. On the other hand, I argue that the athleticism necessary to play basketball provides for better, more talented and well-rounded athletes to play the game. Plus, basketball is a greater source of exercise than baseball on all levels. Win: Me, Me 5. It was a good idea to contest that a baseball\\'s playing field is better than a basketball court due to the fact that baseball is played outdoors and typically in fair weather. However my argument is that not everyone enjoys being outdoors - especially people with allergies; the cancellation of baseball games due to weather conditions can be disappointing, dissatisfying and annoying to players, fans and those that head particular organizations; basketball can in fact be played indoors and outdoors whereas baseball cannot effectively be played indoors Win: Me, Me, Me 6. My opponent claims that baseball has the most interesting increase and decrease of stats (thus providing for a more exciting Fantasy team experience), as well as the most compelling trades in professional sports. My argument is that the topic of debate is baseball vs. basketball, not Fantasy Baseball vs. Fantasy Basketball. Also, while baseball may have interesting trades going on, basketball definitely has superior free agent makets, so. Win: Me, if anything 7. My opponent discussed the adrenaline rush received from baseball; I argued that beating the the time clock as opposed to playing the set number of innings provide for a greater rush. Win: Me 8. Pro mentioned that more people can play baseball than basketball at a time, because there are 9 people on a team as opposed to 5. However I argued that basketball includes the consistent rotation of players, making it probable that 9 or more players can and will participate during the duration of an entire basketball game. Win: Me, if anything 10. My challenger states that baseball and softball are not sexist. I feel like softball being considered a \"sissy version\" of baseball has a mental impact on people\\'s assumption of the sport, especially young kids (girls). Also, the fact that there is a WNBA is a plus for women\\'s involvement in professional sports. Win: Me 11. As far as strategy goes, my opponent successfully argued against my point that there is more implmentation of strategic planning in basketball than in baseball. However, he did not make an argument for baseball having MORE implementation than basketball, so this point results in a tie. Win: Tie 12. My challenger suggests that a sport bing more lucrative does not necessarily make it better, per se, and I agree. However to come people it DOES make it better... or more enjoyable... so. The win goes to me, but I\\'ll consider it a tie. Win: Tie 13. Pro attempted to refute the fact that basketball requires athletes to play a more equal and engaging part of both offense and defense by stating that you never know which part of the field the ball will be set to play. Or something. And while that is true, it still does not make it less true or more okay that basketball requires more skill and whatnot. Win: Me? 14. My opponent stated that basketball discriminates against shorter or smaller people. I argue that many people have overcome that stereotype and give hope to young people who would also like to overcome adversity for a sport that they love. Win: Me? I believe there were even more arguments in which I have out-debated Pro, however, I will conclude for now due to the fact that my challenger has not beat me on one single point throughout this entire debate. So while I do admit that this debate was (the most challeneing, actually) extremely interesting and well-rounded, and that my opponent gave me a decent run for my money, I would also like to point out that I clearly \"won\" on every single point, and therefore deserve the win. I not only successfully argued against all of my opponent\\'s claims, but also made many of my own that he could not refute. My points were all well though out, carefully constructed, and outnumber my challenger\\'s. In addition they were all pretty clever... heh... so happy reading, and vote Con! Thanks :)', 'Almost ALL arguments made on either of our parts are going to be a matter of opinion due to the nature of the debate topic at hand. It is our job to refine our points and exemplify that our arguments are stronger than our respective opponent\\'s; the better competitor will (hopefully) win the most votes. With that said, I will begin by again refuting your argument that baseball is a better sport because of its slower pace laid-back nature. I disagree, sighting the fact that sports in general became popular and celebrated during the time of the Ancient Greeks, in an era where men participated in the first Olympic games and attempted to display superiroity in various aspects of athleticism. Using their bodies, men came to compete and win against their opponents by methods of paramount strength, agility, speed, talent, wit, etc. Generally, when people are able to move and think at a faster pace, it is deemed a more challenging feat. An example is a timed game of chess; people who perform at top-speed or play chess with a time clock are said to be better chess players. Thus a sport that requires a more fast paced tempo can arguably be considered more challenging when using the logic that I have put forth. More challenging means consistent room for improvement, and a better way to exemplify talent and superiority in various areas practically synonomous with sports (i.e. strength and stamina). Also, not every game of basketball has to be fast paced. There are many teams, in fact, that are actually known to both prefer and excel during a more \"laid back\" game of basketball. However, the benefit of basketball over baseball is that one can always choose to either increase or decrease the level of intensity (tempo) of a game, whereas baseball is pretty consistent with its timing and pace. In regard to a time clock vs. set number of innings required for a game, my point was not to argue that a timeclock is of greater value than a set number of innings or plays, but rather to provide an example of why having to \"beat the clock\" provides a greater adrenaline rush. Like I said, you can\\'t really do much to change the tempo of a baseball game, whereas with basketball you can say, \"Ok - there\\'s only a little time left - we have to pick up the pace!\" The game gets more exciting that way for both the players (who have to think on their feet and perform), and the fans who watch in anticipation to see if their team can overcome the pressure, and prevail by outsmarting and outplaying their opponents. I can also provide a more than sufficient rebuttal to your claim that it\\'s beneficial for everyone on the team to have equal at-bats, whereas basketball consists of various players taking different amounts of shots. My main point is that the concept of teamwork doesn\\'t have to do with individual performances being put together to create one result, but rather a collaborative effort to virtually ignore individual success, and focus instead on the achievements of the TEAM as a whole. In other words, people on basketball teams aren\\'t *supposed* to take the same number of shots. The beauty of it is that each position is equally important and consists of different \"tasks\" and responsibilities. For instance, I would expect a Shooting Guard or a Forward to take more shots than a Point Guard. Reason being that the PG\\'s \"job\" isn\\'t to make baskets, per se, but rather to find an open teammate to pass the ball to in order to complete the play and make the shot. A PG\\'s role is different than a Center\\'s job -- that\\'s the beauty of it. It\\'s different positions consisting of different players working together towards a common goal. I love it. I would also like to argue your stance that baseball encourages more kids to play than basketball does. First of all, basketball players do not usually play for the duration of the entire game. In fact, it is common to see a frequent rotation of players going in and out of the game, thus making it not only possible but actually probable that 9 or more kids can participate on a basketball team. Additionally, since you brought up a sport\\'s accessibility to children, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a cheaper and easier sport to play than baseball. This is because someone would have to buy a glove or mitt to play baseball, whereas you only need 3 pieces of equipment (two \"hoops\" and a ball) to play b-ball. ALSO, due to the smaller ball and overall nature of the game, a baseball is easier to lose than a basketball, thus making basketball the better bet for kids who worry about losing equipment. Again I argue the superiority of basketball to baseball due to its more demanding physical attributes to play the game. I believe that sports were designed to exhibit superior athleticism, and you clearly most be in better physical shape and have more refined skills to play basketball over baseball. Plus, a lot of people play sports as an alternative to straight-up exercise, and basketball provides a MUCH greater work out than baseball, obviously. My opponent is correct in stating that there are neither no co-ed baseball or basketball teams; however, there is at least an official professional level agency for women\\'s basketball, whereas baseball remains off-limits to women once they reach a professional level of their careers. Thus many girls choose to participate in basketball over baseball, because they know they have a better chance of making a living as an athlete if they chose one route over the other. And finally, your argument that it\\'s \"nicer\" to enjoy a sport in sunny weather rather than indoors is lacking, to say the least. First of all, just because you enjoy being outdoors does not mean that everybody else does. What about the millions of people who have allergies and prefer being in a place where they don\\'t have to worry about the downsides to their condition? Second, the cancellation of games due to weather conditions can be both disappointing and a huge inconvenience. This goes for both the players, the fans, and the organizations that run the games. Third, the weather outside - for instance the variation of hot and cold - has an impact on a player and their ability to perform. In an indoors arena, the level of playing field is typically very consistent, and therefore does not deter an athlete from performing at their best. Lastly on this point, you forgot that basketball doesn\\'t HAVE to be played indoors -- there are many, many games and events that actually support and/or mandate that basketball be played outside, where players and fans can enjoy all of the \"sunny weather\" that you promoted in regards to the playing field of baseball. Thus where you can and cannot play a sport and when definitely gives basketball the advantage over baseball. To wrap up this around, I would also like to include several key points, including: A) Basketball allows for more strategy implementation B)Regarding professional sports, the average basketball player earns $5 million; the average baseball player earns $2 million C) Basketball requires more skill because a player must always play both the positions of offense and defense during the duration of a game. With baseball, a player can go an entire game (or even season!) without ever having to be on the defensive end of a play. With basketball, all players are resonsible for equal talent and performance on both ends of offense vs. defense; even if they fail in stealing or rebounding a ball, they still must guard their respective assignment or zone to the best of their ability to prevent their opponent from scoring D) Basketball promotes self-esteem and the notion to try and never give up. This is because small players such Muggsy Bogues stood at just 5\\'3\" tall and weighed a mere 136 lbs, and still made it to the NBA as one of the franchise\\'s most successful players << No more characters :P', 'Basketball is the more popular sport world-wide in comparison to baseball, with basketball being ranked as the 2nd most popular with 400+ million participants, and baseball being ranked 7th with 60+ million participants. Because both sports are played in the Olympics, countries all over the world have had exposure to both games, and by the amount of participants that engage in each we can assume that more people are fans of basketball as opposed to baseball. However I will not assume that more participants worldwide = a better sport. Well, maybe. But not necessarily. Thus I will continue on to state that a lot of basketball\\'s assets, in my opinion, you recognized as flaws. For instance I feel that the fast pace of basketball in opposition with baseball is one of the many things that make it a more exciting game to both watch and play. Each \\'play\\' in baseball can be dragged out and even seem monotonous after awhile (foul ball after foul ball after pitch after pitch after pitch with many seconds and pointless minutes in between). However basketball keeps both the athletes and viewers on their toes, and more plays mean more opportunities for the tone and pace of the game to shift. This gives the opposing team a better chance of coming back to regain the lead, thus making it a more exciting and fun game to engage in or spectate. Plus, having a time limit for a game increases the intensity and adrenaline much more than the rush you speak of in your argument for baseball giving you that same feeling. Another aspect of your argument that I disagree with is when you claim that individual responsibility is *benefit* of baseball. Instead I argue that mistakes are more forgivable in basketball, and thus more emphasis is placed on cooperation and teamwork rather than showing off or stressing over the fact that your performance can either make or break the team\\'s record. How often does a baseball player get blamed when he strikes out in the bottom of the 9th and therefore ends his team\\'s chance of winning the game? However in a game of basketball, even if someone misses the winning shot in the 4th quarter, there were many more shots taken in the game of basketball than at-bats in a game of baseball, making it more apparent that a team\\'s win or loss is not thanks in particular to one individual, but rather the team as a collective unit working together effectively and scoring points. I would also like to take this opportunity to disagree that baseball is a cheaper and easier alternative to basketball. This is because kids can make \"baskets\" out of anything just as you can turn any instrument into a \"bat\" of sorts. For instance, you can use a trash can, basket or even drawn-on square box to serve as a \"hoop\" and just about any ball that bounces as a ball. You can even play by yourself if you had to... Furthermore, I would like to elaborate and correct you on your argument that baseball is a safer game than basketball to play. While it\\'s true that you will probably sustain more injuries in a game of basketball than a game of baseball, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a more physical game, and with that intense level of athleticism being demonstrated you are bound to come across both pros and cons in terms of rewards and potential risks. For example, you may be more likely to strain a muscle while playing basketball; however, basketball is a sport that requires more physical activity and stamina. Thus the benefit to this \"risk\" is the fact that basketball keeps you in much better shape than baseball does. This becomes apparent when you take a look at the physical fitness of basketball players vs. the physical health of baseball players. Basketball players have to spend long periods of time running back and forth, and constantly moving various parts of their body at the same time. It provides a great cardio work out, and keeps the muscles flexible, loose and strong. Due to the easy-going and less strenuous nature of the game, baseball players can get away with being less agile and less healthy individuals than basketball players. Thanks to an organization like the WNBA, basketball has become a more popular sport due to its mass appeal geared for and towards women. Instead of creating an \"inferior\" sport like softball (many people feel like it\\'s a sissy version of baseball), women are actually encouraged to participate in a sport like basketball, and can now even go Pro. Additionally, college basketball programs are FAR more successful than their baseball and softball programs (times ten). In response to a ball park being an ideal place to hold a sporting event, I disagree based on the reasoning that you can play basketball in any type of weather condition during any particular season. Whereas a baseball game can be rained out, or ended early on account of drizzle or snow fall, basketball is played indoors and is therefore more convenient/consistent. You mentioned that baseball was relatively easy to learn; I\\'ll argue that basketball has rules and goals that are just as simple. At the same time, a certain amount of planning and strategy (not to mention practice, training, strengthening and conditioning) goes into basketball While you contend that baseball has the most compelling trade aspects in any realm of professional sports, I\\'d like to point out, \"The Larry Bird rule that gives NBA teams the right to match deals in order to keep their stars gives basketball the advantage\" -- Baseball America. With that, I think I\\'ll go to bed for now. I feel like I have sufficiently responded to each and every one of your points, and in turn made some arguments of equivocal or greater value to prove that basketball is in fact the superior of the two sports. I now leave it up to you to respond, and in my next argument I will be glad to refute any of your additional points as well as provide some more of my own for a final rebuttal in the third round. Thank you and good night :)', \"Again it becomes apparent that the differentiation of the two games only lead to a matter of opinion. .. While I think a slower paced game is more enjoyable, you have argued that the opposite can be said of other people. And since more people do enjoy basketball over baseball according to statistics, I suppose you do have a good point. However I ask that voters vote not based on the number of reasons that one challenger provides the other, but rather the validity of our points, and our ability of one opponent to outtalk the other and provide for a more convincing argument. On a final note I would like to state for the record that I do believe my points have more relevance and certainty than my opponents, and I would like to take this final opportunity to argue some of her last points. Here we go. .. A. Basketball does NOT in fact allow for more strategy implementation. There is an equal or more amount of strategy that goes into baseball. This is because a batter can choose a number of routes that he wants to go, for instance, attempting to hit the ball to a particular side of the field, bunting over swinging, intentionally being hit by a pitch, intentionally walking or striking out, etc. A player can also choose to steal bases, go for a double play over a single play, attempt to run home after a catch is made in the outfield, and more. A pitcher has a variety of pitching options to choose from, etc. And managers and coaches alike have to use their smarts to come up with the best route to receive the best result, so don't give me any of that crap that basketball rquires the most strategy or plays because that is simply not true. B. Basketball might be more lucrative than baseball, so what. That doesn't make it better. C. This much is true, basketball players do definitely have a chance to play more defense than baseball players. However baseball players still always have to be on their toes just in case a play comes to them. The suspense is that you never know where the ball is going to be in play.\", 'Based on you turning my position of basketball\\'s flaws being assets, I think it\\'s fair to assume that it is simply a matter of differing opinions and therefore neither can be regarded as fact. So for instance, I say that baseball\\'s slower paced tempo of the game is of better value than the upbeat pace of basketball, because it provides for a more relaxing sport to watch and laid back sport to play. You get to compete athletically without too much exhaustion which can and does make the game more enjoyable for certain people. To refute your point that basketball is greater than baseball because there is a \"time limit\" per se, my argument is that there is also some kind of limit on baseball as there are a set number of innings (unless the game goes into extra innings, the way basketball can go into overtime). To argue that basketball is more of a team sport because there is less individual responsibility, I also say nay... I feel as though each individual performance collectively adds to the team as a whole; everyone has equal amount of at-bats to make things happen, whereas in basketball not everyone takes the same amount of shots. I agree that both baseball and basketball are of the same accessibility to play- touche. However on that note I would like to point out that baseball encourages more kids to play, be involved and participate in a team sport because each team requires 9 players instead of just 5. Thus more kids can play in the game without having a lot of people \"sit out\" or whatever. I also think that the lesser \"athleticism\" you need to play baseball is actually a good thing. People who want to have the option to train their bodies, work hard, stay in shape, etc which will undoubtedly improve their performance in the game. But those who want to remain physically unfit also have the option to play (ie: a position like 1B where there is little amount of running or moving required). Softball is not that popular, but just as there are no co-ed basketball teams, there are no co-ed baseball teams; that doesn\\'t mean that baseball discriminates against women. And the less popularity of a sport doesn\\'t make it less awesome, you\\'re right. For example most people would argue that soccer or \"football\" is the best sport, but if you look at the numbers in this country, soccer doesn\\'t even come close to being considered the favorite or most widely played. I personally enjoy the fact that baseball has to be played in nice weather. It provides a nice atmosphere for players and fans alike, plus it gets people outside and enjoying the sunshine for a change. And that\\'s about it for now.', 'Although both baseball and basketball are both popular team sports, there are many advantages that baseball has over basketball making it the better of the two games. For instance, while both sports promote teamwork and a collective effort by all athletes on their respective teams, baseball allows for a greater aspect of personal responsibility. Each member of the team has the opportunity to literally \"go to bat\" for their team and make an impact on their teams standing and the entire game. Also, teamwork is necessary to complete many plays such as the double play, triple play, 2B or SS cut off on a throw to home plate, or even to get a guy out at 1B. But at the same time, each player has to do their part in order to complte the play, thus putting a certain amount of pressure on the player and creating a good kind of stress or adrenaline rush that makes the game more exciting and fun for both the athlete and the audience. The slower paced game of baseball is one of the main reasons why it remains such a popular sport and \"America\\'s favorite past time\" ... because you can sit back, relax, have a beer, and enjoy the game without always having to be so riled up all the time. Though baseball definitely has its exciting moments, and the thrill of your favorite player hitting a home run or grand slam never gets old, its definitely a more chill game that provides for a different type of viewing experience. For people (kids) who want to play baseball at home, but don\\'t have a lot of money for equipment, they\\'ll be happy to know that you can make a bat of just about anything... a stick (stickball), a paddle, a raquet, etc. And just about any type of ball... wiffle ball, hand ball, tennis ball, etc. can be used for a baseball. You can make bases out of just about anything too, even draw them on. And gloves may or may not be necessary depending on the type of ball and \"bat\" that is being used. But my point is that it is not a terribly expensive game to play. The rules of baseball are pretty easy to learn, making it easy to grasp and a fun time for both beginners and champions alike. Baseball is one of the safest sports you can play; there is little wear and tear on an athlete\\'s body (that\\'s why baseball players have a longer career that athletes involved with other sports) and there is a lesser chance of injury than say with basketball which is known to give its players knee problems, ankle injuries, and more. Professional baseball is played in a ball park, which is a traditional gathering spot for friends and family to meet up and have an infamous ballpark frank, or spend the day together taking in a good game. Professional baseball also has the most compelling trades and interesting increase and decrease of stats, also making it the most fun Fantasy pro sport game. Baseball has been around longer in the United States than basketball, and it has earned the title of our National Pastime because so many Americans are fans. It is a fun game on any competitive level, and the better of the two sports by far. Your turn!', 'Your last comment about redundancy is an excellent description of this debate. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. \"punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child.\" This is statement is correct if saying it from the viewpoint it is looked through, a human society viewpoint, civilization and acts of human being towards other human beings. It is simply not correct if viewed through the awesome sinless, perfect authority of God\\'s Just and Holy Sovereignty. \"examples of where god commits genocide for the sins of the adult population.\" <------The bibles position is that all have fallen short, and all are sinful that \"deserve\" hell but (I know, I know) were given something they didn\\'t deserve, that is, Jesus Christ. ================== [2.] 100% of people who are educated on the Hebrew and Greek translations will all shoot you down on this. Job is THE perfect example of God\\'s ultimate authority in the old testament scriptures because they understand what the original writer was in fact portraying, not what the reader thought it was portraying. To interject your own opinion about what was happening to Job and ignore the person that was experiencing it, not to mention, actually talking to God, heck... to believe that the events were not false and that Jobs knowledge (because that\\'s what the bible says it is) is false is a fallacy in it\\'s own merit. I\\'m sorry I\\'m breaking my rule: \"Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals...\" <---- Steals? The Bible states that all the wealth people own already belongs to God, so God cannot steal what has always been his. ...all his wealth. Then proceeds to hurt Job personally with illness. All this time Job is begging for an answer,...\" <------ Not once did Job ever beg or even ask for an answer... his mistake (not sin) was challenging God to dare accuse himself of sinning(and dare use that as an explanation for his actions against Job), because Job KNEW he was not guilty of sinning. \"...asking what he did wrong, what he did to deserve this(talking to his friends).\" <---- I\\'d hate to say it but this is simply not in the biblical story. It was Job\\'s friends who accused him of sinning, and it was Job who openly challenged God to prove that sin was a cause of these events, because again Job KNEW this was not the case. \"Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN...\" <----- You have this 100% backwards, it was Satan who started this all because he wanted to wager a bet that Job would curse God. \"...(you know, the most evil entity ever). At the end, God shows up and instead of explaining to Job why all this has happened to him, he goes on a rhetorical speech asking him \"where you there when the earth was born?\" <---- Again, the mother of all explanation being ignored(Sorry to say it like that, really I\\'m a nice guy!), God can do anything is pleases... even Job knew this... and was terrified because of it! Job 23:13 - \"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases... 15 Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him. ================ [3.] \"How is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God?\" 1. I am not obligating god. I am merely stating that by human standards, what god did and the system he created was/is not fair. 2. \"Again, not everyone was \"constantly sinning\". The bible states that everyone constantly sins... 3. \"Nor do we have any proof that God\\'s law was known to them.\" There is also no proof that Abraham became righteous as a result from God speaking to him, on the contrary, it simply said that Abram obeyed God\\'s command to start his Journey, nothing more. \"(btw: Romans-1 says this for the believers in the sense that \"god was all around them\" in the argument for his existence. Not his Law.).\" <----- I agreed when I put it there and even now! Hence \"So people are without excuse.\" I realize you are logical person... all of the \"no proof\" arguments are canceled out because of the basic logical standpoint that \"the absence of proof does not prove anything\". \"The point is that you are assuming that these people had full knowledge of their actions\"<------- Not at all, I did note that Numbers and Leviticus accounts for unintentional sins and even unknown sins! Honestly, do you know anyone, like in Lot\\'s case that wanted to rape other men by breaking down Lot\\'s door, and didn\\'t know it was wrong? Even aborigines know to respect a man\\'s home! 4. Unintentional Sin is again, for the believers of the religion. Those who could not know of the religion could not know of the concept of Sin, be it unintentional or otherwise. <---- you are right with the word \"sin\" but are wrong with the action of sin. This is ultimately shot down with Romans 2 that says: \"\"13for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified. 14For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,\"\" [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. \"[NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others.\" <----because I was busy making that case that this is not true...I am being redundant now, guilty! \"Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human?

That made me feel special coming from someone yourself. And I would never dare to resort to such childish tactics that unstable Christians resort to[yes I said that].

I didn\\'t argue that... technically the bible did that one! Thanks again!', 'Before I begin, I would like to say how much I admire your constant stable minded attitude toward responding. A true logical mind indeed you are... something I aspire to attain to perfection if that were possible. I do accept the note of not correcting your responses but just responding to them. I do have to admit that I did not attack or even touch the topic of God dealing with Sodom and Gomorrah, and unfortunately must decline the opportunity again because, like others, this \"problem\" can automatically be answered by addressing underlying issues. One of these underlying issues that was accidentally assumed, and not picked up by myself in the opening of this debate, was \"a baby\\'s innocence\". 1.\"A baby\\'s innocence\" I am almost afraid that if this point is not fairly discussed and unskewed, then this debate will reflect the same direction. I must bring this debate back to the rule of \"for the sake of this argument the Bible is true.\" That means that for the sake of this debate, even cute, innocent looking, tiny, can\\'t-make-proper-decisions-for-themselves babies are in fact just as sinful as us adults who can and do sin on purpose. \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin my mother conceived me.\" - Psalms 51:5. \"The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth. They have venom like the venom of a serpent; like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, or a skillful caster of spells. O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord\" - Psalms 58:3-6 2. \"The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.\" (Job 1:21) If there is anyone in the Bible that has the right to complain about God being immoral, it is Job! He had his own children taken away amongst other horrible things, and yet he states that the Lord has the right to do so hence, him praising God after. I am compelled to reinstate that this is not Jobs opinion, but KNOWLEDGE of the Lord. 3. The idea that \"God NOT giving people a second chance is not fair.\" I formed this educated assumption by \"P1\" which says \"God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them.\" To say that God didn\\'t give them a second chance is to automatically admit they did something that is deserving of some sort of punishment. Plain and simply put I will answer this in the form of a question...how is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God? And just in case this turns into a \"well, they didn\\'t know they were sinning against God\" issue... Romans 1 says \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness, 19 because what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes \" his eternal power and divine nature \" have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse.\" Levitus and Numbers, as you know, even goes on to talk about even \\'unintentional sin\\' or unknown sin must also be offered a sacrifice. 4. God\\'s right to choose. \"P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell.\" This is simply God\\'s right to choose, in this case, he chose to keep a promise made to Abraham, because God is faithful in his promises. Let me fairly remind you that he almost broke this promise as my previous argument shows [which is another debate in it\\'s own]. Matthew 20:1-16: 9 \"The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. 10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12 \"These who were hired last worked only one hour,\" they said, \"and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\" 13 \"But he answered one of them, \"I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn\"t you agree to work for a denarius? 14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15 Don\"t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\" C: One of the most common mistakes that happen when humans question God\\'s moral compass is to imply that God is not the creator of the morals. God alone has a right reserved to take away anything and everything according to the bible. Unlike us, he created everything and according to the bible IS everything. God also, unlike us, is not only sinless but void of sin. These are major contributors, when understood, to God\\'s \"seemingly immoral, genocidal, murderous\" ways.', 'As a preface to anyone who is viewing this debate: 1. Whether you are Christian or Non-Christian, please view the facts as they are presented as unbiased as possible... otherwise the voting could never truly reflect the facts \\'not opinions\\' presented as they are for THIS debate. I thank the Pro for providing the only ground work for this type of debate... and something that even you the reading must agree to for the sake of voting properly. 2. \"Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true.\" <--- As per the Pro. 3. Also reader, please note that he does use the term \\'true\\' and not \\'real\\'. So you must accept, for the purposes of this debate that EVERYTHING the Bible says is \\'TRUE\\' and not false. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. First Rebuttal: 1. \"The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity.\" -Surprisingly this was actually my first statement that I was locked into and I realized that there is actually flaw to this statement. The flaw is the word humanity! The definition that is. You see if I were to take your rules seriously about this debate than this statement is done out of ignorance. I could literally use basic math to rephrase the sentence to see it a little more clearly by using your given definition of sin. \"The system in the bible for [disobeying God]and it\\'s punishment[of going to hell], is not fair in regards to humanity.\" For you to fully understand the Bibles arguments that God is in fact being \"fair\", you must understand God\\'s attributes. There are many, but the main one is God is Holy. Many Christians surprisingly don\\'t even know what this means! The bible says God is \"Holy, holy, holy\" (Revelation 4:8), it\\'s saying that He is separated, separated, separated (Old Hebrew language would repeat something that is important rather than modern English using BOLD or exclamations) which is referring to God being so very separated from the world, people, evil and sin that it is not even funny. Again not by choice, it\\'s just what he is. So when Adam and Eve disobeyed God\\'s commandment of not eating from the tree of good and evil, they chose to disobey God\\'s commandment and because they had knowledge like God ABOUT sin, unlike God, they had freewill to act upon that knowledge. And again God is Holy and sin has no part in God or his actions whatsoever, God simply has knowledge of it just like Satan told Eve. The end result is a disobedience woman and man who passing their \"corruption\" to their descendants \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" -1 Corinthians 15:50 THEN ENTERS MY NICE FLOW INTO YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT... 2. \"Sins of our Fathers\" \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" Psalms 51:5 - To be absolutely clear, their is nothing in the bible that says God has ever or will ever give a death sentence to a baby whose (according to your example) parents are terrible role models when it comes to following God. \"I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of THOSE WHO HATE ME, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those WHO LOVE ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS.\" Without going into a lot of detail, there is nowhere here that says God will kill or send to hell the sons of sinful parents. You\\'d have to reach petty far to get it there. Deuteronomy 24:16 says, \"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.\" Lastly your remark about us being \"moral\" is also ignorance because according to the rules the Bible is true, so if I were to take that and rephrase your remark it would read... \"We as [Sinful, disobedient people] do not in good moral conscience blame the [psalms 51:5] for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give [psalms 51:5] death sentences because the father murdered.\" <---- How can immoral sinful people have a good moral conscious? I\\'m just trying to follow your Rule about the Bible being true! \"And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity.\" <------ I agree and God does too! 3. Those \"undeserving\" of Hell. -For the sake of readers getting bored I will correct some Biblical areas as per your rule, as to bring about a quick non-biased approach from the reader: \"In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not [ask for] forgiveness goes to Hell.\" \"This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven.\" Not so my friend according to the Bible which is true for the sake of this debate \"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 10:4 \"P1:God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood [Noah is called a Preacher of Righteousness - 2 Peter 2:5], Sodom and Gomorrah [Genesis 18:16-33 says that Abraham pleaded for the safety of Sodom]\"the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all [were killed] thanks to God\\'s actions [I don\\'t get this, so if an executioner, in your words \"morally\" executes a killer then the executioner is wrong?]. \"It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture.\" <-----This is actually very surprisingly biblical. Psalm 115:3 says \"But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.\" and 1 Samuel 2:6 says \"The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.\" \"P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system.\" <---- I just have to ask, who are these so called \"good\" people your are referring to specifically? \"P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. <---- This is simply not founded in any scripture although Israel is God\\'s chosen people God even wanted to wipe out Israel at one point [Numbers 14:11-19]. \"According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity.\"<----please refer to previous C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents DOES IN FACT present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment. I hope I\\'ve been fair in my rebuttal.', 'Ah. I did not intend to pull a \"fast one\" on you, but it\\'s hard to phrase the \"rules\" correctly in the start. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. -Now first off I was not making the argument that a child is not sinful from birth, or that bible does not state so. What I was saying is that the punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child. -This cuts back to the \"sins of our father\" point. We are all paying for the sins of Adam in general, but there are examples of where god commits genocide for the sins of the adult population. ================== [2.] Oh boy. Yeah Job is one of the few examples I would never, EVER use in reference to his \"knowledge\" of the Lord or his morality. Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals all his wealth. Then proceeds to hurt Job personally with illness. All this time Job is begging for an answer, asking what he did wrong, what he did to deserve this(talking to his friends). Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN(you know, the most evil entity ever). At the end, God shows up and instead of explaining to Job why all this has happened to him, he goes on a rhetorical speech asking him \"where you there when the earth was born?\" -Then God proceeds to replace that which Job had lost, but not in originality. God replaces everything by quantity. [The story of Job shows entirely that God punishes unfairly and to those undeserving.] God effectively murdered innocent people to prove a point to Satan. That\\'s probably the worse example you could have given for your argument. ================ [3.] \"How is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God?\" 1. I am not obligating god. I am merely stating that by human standards, what god did and the system he created was/is not fair. 2. Again, not everyone was \"constantly sinning\". We have no proof that all of mankind(even the children) were committing outrageous acts against God for the story of Noah, or that the slave/Egyptian children sinned so heavily, or that any of these acts of complete genocide were Justified. This is another problem with the system and it\\'s fairness, God does not state what sin or what acts lead to the genocide of these people. 3. Nor do we have any proof that God\\'s law was known to them. (btw: Romans-1 says this for the believers in the sense that \"god was all around them\" in the argument for his existence. Not his Law.). -No proof that God came to them as he did Moses. -No proof that God\\'s law is available to everyone in a way they can comprehend it. -No proof that Jesus has shown himself to everyone either.(for the argument of after). The point is that you are assuming that these people had full knowledge of their actions, the consequences, and the system God presented. The bible never mentions this, nor does reality support it. Even now you can easily prove that God does not present his system to everyone. [Note]: I get that we are arguing with the bible = true rule,but when it aligns with modern reality I think this has relevance. 4. Unintentional Sin is again, for the believers of the religion. Those who could not know of the religion could not know of the concept of Sin, be it unintentional or otherwise. ============= [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. [NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others. Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human? That\\'s taking it a bit too far. --------------- C: God\\'s \"right\" MkII No. Creation of something does not imply ownership, especially when free-will and sentience are concerned. Also implying that God is above morality is implying the appeal to authority fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org... Please, do not argue that because God is perfect, the system must be perfect. That is beneath you. Note: [Redundancy]: Of course god is \"void of sin\", since to sin is to disobey him. Alrighty, having fun so far and thank you for participating. Lets go to round 3!', 'I feel that any addition to the original post I made might push the debate farther than it should in terms of simplicity and a \"simple read\", although it is already very long. My response in accordance to the points brought up: 1. I\\'m not exactly sure how to go about saying this so I will try to make it as clear as possible. If you are making the point that God is seperate from humanity and that god is holy, seperated, and a different entity: I accept that as per the bible stating it.(I thought this was by default accepted once you accept the bible as tru per the opening). However, your math was off. The punishment of sinning is not only that you are sent to hell, but that God may take your life before that(and then consequently you would go to hell). I want o make this clear because to say that the only punishment God has given for sin in the bible is to to got to hell, is not true. 2. \"Sins of our fathers\". I\\'d like to address the acts that we are all born sinful and that is becaue of the original \"fall\" of Adam and Eve. Romans 5:18-19: 18 Therefore, as one trespass[b] led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness[c] leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man\\'s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man\\'s obedience the many will be made righteous. -Let us ignore the Jesus stuff for the sake of the debate. This verse states that all were condemned for the sin of Adam and Eve. The \"father\" of all mankind, made many sinners. Note: You did not respond or explain to people why God killed the several groups of people in the stories of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, where in each the entire group of people were wiped out because they were deemed \"sinful\" or \"corrupt\" in the eyes of God. -You assume that the verses stating that the child will not pay for the sins of the father prove that no child was punished in these genocides unfairly, but that assumption is false. Not only in the sense that all mankind has paid for the sins of Adam, but that these groups of people(children included) were punished for the sins of the mature members. Innocent children were punished (killed) in these acts. Note: I am not proposing that the bible is false, but that the verse was meant for a different interpretation. That being The son shall not bear the responsibility of the father according to the law.(i.e. the 613 commandments in the Old Testament). So that if a father broke the law, the son could not be punished for this. I believe this verse was intended in such a way. -God did kill children. In accordance with the story of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, all died for their sin(from birth) and the sins of their father. To think that not one child existed in these examples is rather naive, but for an example we can look towards the story of Moses: Exodus 11: 4-7: \"4. So Moses said, \"This is what the Lord says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 5 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt\"worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 7 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.\" Then you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.\" -I\\'d like to note that there are examples of where God himself killed the innocent and where he ordered the Israelites to do such. There is a difference, but I find that the overall effect the same. [On the topic of Born-Sinners] The Bible repeatedly tells us that we are born sinners thanks to adam and eve. In the first part I opened with the assumption that both parties would accept children as being \"innocent\". I make this assumption based upon the notion that children do not fully understand or comprehend the acts that they do and their consequences. I realize that this can also apply to more mature humans, but for children I think we can agree that \"innocence\" is among them to a certain age. This presents a conflicting view. We percieve children as innocent though the bible does not and from birth gives them the effective sentence of Hell, though they could not have possibly disobeyed god. This is effectively \"the sins of the father\", that father being Adam. 3. Deserving of Hell. I\\'d like to make the point that the verse you listed(1corinthians 10:4) is talking aobut the Jewish religion. I.e. the same \"spiritual drink\" and \"unto Moses\" relate to the Old Testament. Of course within the belief that Jesus was God(the trinity), those who already believed in the Jewish God(i.e. the jews), would have technically been believing in Jesus before he came to Earth. However that leaves us with John 14:6 \"6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" So the original meaning of the Corinthians verse is that the Jews would continue their religion by believing in Jesus. This does not apply to the non-jewish people before Jesus, but ot assure the Jews that Christianity is a continuation of their religion. ============================================= The whole point of 3 was that those who could not know of the Law, Jesus, or of the bible were sent to hell, regardless if they are \"Good\" by moral or even biblical standards. It is in accordance with 2, where they are punished not by something they did, but by the sin of Adam. Meaning: People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. ========================================= In response to your edits on P1-3(I\\'d rather you not since this makes it harder to read through later.) P1-3 1.Noah can be called a preacher and Abraham can plead for Sodom, but that has no effect whatsoever on the decision made by God and what it stands for. In response to your assumption that God \"morally\" executed a killer, I deny that. God committed genocide. (Genocide definition: the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.) This is entirely different from the moral justification of killing a specific person or group. The justification for genocide is non-existent. 2. The good people? The people who are for the most part good. Humanitarian, peaceful, non-violent. I\\'d presume there is a general definition of a \"good\" person we can agree on. 3. It is founded on all the scripture, in fact the entire story of the Old Testament is of the Jewish people. To clarify, I was talking of the time before Jesus. Genesis 17:7 \"7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\" ==================== Note: You did not edit the closing correctly. You left the phrase \"and punishes those undeserving of punishment\" ========= To summarize: 2.\"Sins of Our Father\" - Adam and Eve: mankind pays the price for generations because of their Sin. The are (according to the bible) the parents of all. -God also murdered select groups of people for the sins of the whole. -God did kill children(listed examples). [Children are innocent] -Yet the God has killed them in the act of Genocide. -Yet God condemns them to hell from their birth. 3. People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. P1: God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them. P2: See 3. P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell. C: The system of sin is one that punishes those undeserving of punishment and for circumstances that are beyond a person\\'s control.', 'Hi I\\'ll be on the side of \"Pro\" and will be debating on the subject of Christianity\\'s sin-and-punishment being fair to the human race as a whole. Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. The definition of Hell is: A place where the souls of mankind who enter are eternally tormented/tortured. I base this on the things god has punished for.(i.e. the forbidden fruit, going against his commands, etc.). ============================ If you wish to post something to this or against it, please do so, but I am not hoping for this to be the main topic. ============================= The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity. 1. \"Sins of our Fathers\" -This applies to the concept in Christianity known as \"our fallen world\" -This applies to God\\'s punishment of people throughout the bible for the sins of their father or great grandfather. The belief of paying for the sins or disobedience of our fathers is unfair. We as humans do not in good moral conscience blame the child for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give children death sentences because the father murdered. And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity. 2. Those undeserving of Hell. In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not acquire forgiveness goes to Hell. This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven. P1: God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all went to hell thanks to God\\'s actions. It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture. P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system. P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity. C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents does not present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment.

I\\'ll refute your case in the next round.==Case== FrameworkObservation 1: The primary purpose of punishment prima facieis retribution; rehabilitation is a secondary concern. Crimes are, after all, acts of aggression against victims where as rehabilitation is an act of restoration towards the criminal; it must thus be regarded as fundamentally unjust to put the benefits of the criminal (IE rehabilitation) above the benefits to the victim (IE compensation and retribution). As Michael Moore put it: “We are justified in punishing because and only because offenders deserve it.” Retribution needs to be valued above restoration. Observation 2: Consider only the effects that the implementation of Capital punishment has on the deserving--victims and law abiding citizens (civil socety). Observation 3: Abolish means to do away with entirely. If there\\'s one forseeable case in which Capital Punishment in needed, you negate.Observation 4: Ignore all objections the CP that address issues with the current system (can be reformed). C1: Capital Punishment deters crimeMethodology: We need to apply ceteris paribus when looking at the Death Penalty. We can\\'t compare Texas to New York, or New Jersey to Louisiana for obvious reasons; consider only the relationships between crime and capital punishment in specific places. Empirics: Westley Lowe observed that between 1991 and 1999 there was a 700% increase in the number of executions, along with a drop of 33% in the murder rate. More specifically, in Texas the resumption of executions in 1982 resulted in a 60% drop in the murder rate; within Texas, the Houston area (Harris county, where the polunsky execution unit is housed) the area with the most aggressive death penalty prosecuters reside, experienced a 72% decrease in the murder rate between \\'91-99[1]. This is significant, because it shows not only that nationwide murder decreased but as we get into areas that aggressively impost capital punishment (Texas executes more people than any other state, and Harris county more than any other county) the results are even more substantial! I could bring in more empirical evidence for this, but I don\\'t think it\\'s needed. Academics: Lowes findings on deterrence have been held true in at least three major academic studies, namely: Studies from Emory University stating that each execution prevents between three and eighteen murders. [2] A 2006 study from the University of Houston, stating that the Illinois moratorium on the Death Penalty led to 150 additional homicides [3] A University of Colorado at Denver study showing that for each execution five muders were prevented.[4]. Logic: Of course, not all of the observed decrease in the murder rate is the result of Capital punishment, but there can be little doubt that a just society and \"tough on crime\" laws discourage criminal behavior. A study from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center found that a decrease in violent crime resulted from harsher penalties[5] (specifically defined as \"Increase in, higher probability of, and longer duration of incarceration.\"). The result is you negate since the lives of vicious murderers can\\'t outweigh the lives of innocent civilians. C2: RecidivismCapital Punishment carries with it one incredible advantage, and that is that no executed murderer has ever harmed another individual again. As a matter of fact, of Death Row inmates held in 2009 over 5% committed their capital crime while in prison or on escape, and an amazing 2/3rds were previously convicted of a felony[6]. The last time Capital Punishment was abolished in the United States (1972), dozens of inmates were given sentences of life imprisonment and were later paroled, many of whom killed again, over 25 known victims are the result of these post-furman cases, along with dozens more from escaped or paroled murderers[7]. Two things must be drawn from this: 1. Laws change, parole boards change, rulings change, and people forget the past. The only way to forever ensure that a a murderer doesn\\'t strike again is to kill him. 2. An immediate abolition (as the resolution calls for) would lead to more disasters. To use Texas as an example, life without parole was not implement until late 2005, so all inmates who committed their crimes before then (the vast majority) would be eligible for Parole and one day released[8]. Affirmation leads to deaths by historical precedents. Even behind bars criminals manage to strike again. For example, Clarence Ray Allen, serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole (the likely alternative) still managed to cause the deaths of still more people: he got a paroled inmate he knew to kill one who testified against him, along with 2 completely innocent bystanders[9]. In an uncharacteristic act of justice and logic, the state of California executed this filth in 2006. He will never harm anyone again. C3: Justice.Refer back to my framework, we can only justifiably punish people because they deserve it, to deny this is absolute insanity! I will lay out two hypothetical (although not unrealistic) scenarios where the Death Penalty should surely be implemented. I have little doubt that my opponent will accuse me of making an \"appeal to emotion\" but since Justice is an emotional construct, theres little use in such an objection. One:How should our society respond to evil?Imagine a pedophile. He has fantasies about little girls, and constantly stalks them on the internet and in person. Constantly. Finally one day he snaps, and kidnaps an innocent little child, around age 6 or 7, takes her into a secluded area, pulls off her clothes, and brutally rapes her as she screams in vain for mercy and help. Finally, because he\\'s a sick and twisted animal, he smashes her head with a rock and runs away. Now, we have two options. We can send him to prison for the rest of his life. We can pay to feed, clothe, protect, entertain, and \"rehabilitate\" him for the rest of his life. We can look the little girls parents in the eye and say, yeah your innocent child had to die, but her killer gets to live off of your dime because we dont want to \"sink to his level\". Sorry. What justice is that? The parents will have to deal with the constant nightmare of knowing that somewhere that predator still lives, and can still harm others; he can potentially escape, or they could (God forbid) have to go through to biannual nightmares of his parole hearings because of a change in sentencing laws (as happened in the sickening James Moore rape/murder case[10].). At the very least they know that he will be sitting in his cell watching television and pleasuring himself on the memories of what he did to their beautiful daughter for the rest of his days, all payed for by them and their fellow law abiding tax payers. Wonderful.Or, we could hang/electrocute/shoot/euthanize/gas him and end it once and for all. It seems that anyone with any moral sense what so ever knows which option is preferable. Two: Imagine for this scenario we have a leader of a militant personality cult, convicted of rape and murder. His followers are fanatic and will fight to the death to protect him, and commit suicide on his command. In the Aff world, he\\'s imprisoned and his followers fight to get him out--they kill dozens of gaurds and lesser inmates in the process before they are all shot. In the Neg world, the man is rightfully executed and his followers commit suicide with him This might be a strange scenario, but recall that even one example where CP is needed is enough to negate. Also imagine a war criminal such as Adolf Hitler. My opponent must prove his system outweighs mine in:1. Deterrence2. Justice3. Recidivism preventionAlong with showing compelling reasons to change the status quo. Before then, the resolution is completely negated. The Death Penalty is a just consequence for those who choose a path of evil. http://www.debate.org...', 'I accept.', 'Partly my fault too, but yeah thanks for understanding, and sorry again. >.<', \"Damn it all. I'm very sorry but I won't be able to finish this debate. Very sorry for the horrible conduct.\", \"First I would like to say it is a pleasure to be debating thett3 once again on this topic. Judging from our last debate I'm sure this will be worthwhile. My arguments: Short Overview:I will be using three basic contentions to support my case. The first will show the unnecessary and major risk that will always exist with the death penalty, but does not exist with life imprisonment. The second will show the physchological societal shaping of ones personality and character traits brought about by events in ones life that leads to the fact that certain persons are not at fault for the way they turn out and thus imposing the harshest penalty against them is unjust and we must bend our efforts towards reforming these persons rather than terminating them. The third will show that capital punishment is inefficient in accomplishing the goals of the state, in that there are three main purposes for the state in taking action against law-breakers and capital punishment only performs two of those, while with life imprisonment we have the possibility of accomplishing all three. C.1 As long as the death penalty is in use, there is always the risk of killing innocents. Everyone should agree on the fact that every risk of note existing in our form of punishment aught to be diminished if possible. What about the utmost risk? The risk of the state killing innocent inhabitants of its own jurisdiction? Sadly this still exists through the use of capital punishment. Every time we send someone to their execution there is the possibility that we are sending an innocent man too his death. Why on earth should we allow these risks to take place when there is no need? For there is indeed not much need. Life imprisonment is effective and never includes the chance of killing an innocent man. Those sentenced to life imprisonment have the chance to be proven innocent before they die. Despite what advocates of the death penalty say, innocents being executed are not at all a rare accurance as evidence shows. Well over eighty people in the past quarter century have been condemned but then released before execution. [1] This source shows detailed accounts of eleven innocents being executed. [2] One researcher says he has found at least 74 cases in which wrongful executions have most likely taken place. [2] 69 inmates on death row have been released since 1973 (Source is from 1997 so it would be allot higher now).[3] This clearly shows the risks of the DP. Risks which are completely unnecessary and should be gotten rid of immediately. These men were lucky to escape with their lives. I should add that there have, undoubtedly, been cases in which innocent people have been executed but have not been proved innocent afterwards. After being executed there is not much need for someone to try too prove the innocence of someone who is already dead. So there are undoubtedly instances in the past where we have executed an innocent man but did not know so, and still do not know. With life imprisonment there is zero chance of killing an innocent man. It is a horrible thing for an innocent person to be killed at the hands of the state. It is also completely unnecessary. C.2 Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development theory [9] This theory clearly shows that the way people turn out is based much on their life events. Thus it is not entirely their fault but corrupt society's. Rather than just executing criminals we should realize that one, they are not solely at fault, and two, we have the possibility of reforming them. Now obviously the death penalty is reserved for only the most extreme crimes, and I think it is logical to believe those people who commit these crimes are just products of our corrupt society. This theory demonstrates my argument. Imposing our harshest punishment against those who are not entirely at fault is clearly unjust.Many people are dealt with less harshly due to mental disorders. This follows the same lines. C.3 Those executed cannot be be reformed, or rehabilitated. Capital punishment does not achieve maximum purpose.Why do we take action against law breakers? Punishment Segregation Rehabilitation The ideal form of state action against criminals is one that accomplishes all purposes. This is an obvious fact. Thus whatever accomplishes all three purposes most effectively we must consider superior. With the use of life imprisonment we have the chance of accomplishing all three of these. However with the use of capital punishment the third is impossible, unless they are reformed before they are executed. But it is much more likely they would be reformed if they have their whole life to be reformed. Thus it is safe to conclude life imprisonment is superior too capital punishment. The death penalty deprives criminals of a second chance which SHOULD be given to them. The question is, why would we be using a form of punishment that only accomplishes two of its three main purposes, when there is another option that may accomplish all three? Though it's not completely necessary, here are a few examples. Two murderers, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, were sentenced to life imprisonment, but latter expressed remorse at their actions.[7] If they had been sentenced to death they would never have had the chance to repent. Watson and Atkins, two other murderers, became Christian Fundamentalists after being given a life sentence.[7]With the use of the death penalty the State is not accomplishing what it is supposed too.

Here is what Christ said about Thyatira: \"Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

However, it seems that a majority of his points are new arguments rather than the rebuttals that we had agreed on for round 3. I will, though, respond to them anyway even though the arguments provided by opponent ultimately shouldn\"t be given much weight (due to their not meeting the criteria set for the round). I would also like to note, that my opponent offers no evidence for any of his arguments. [For the purposes of space, I have included only the first and last few words of some of my opponent\\'s longer arguments; the full arguments can be seen in the previous round] 1-\"[I]t\"s glorified infidelity.\" This is not the case. Infidelity is described as \"marital disloyalty; adultery.\"[1] Voluntary polygamous marriage (VPM) certainly does not meet the prior criterion; one partner is never being disloyal to a married partner by being with another married partner of the same marriage; it is the same marriage. The second criterion should probably be defined in its own right. Adultery is \"voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than his or her lawful spouse.\"[2] So, VPM also fails to meet the second criterion of infidelity because a partner would be having sex with someone who is his or her lawful spouse. 2-\"It would be difficult for the government to tax.\" Taxation is already a difficult process, but I suppose my opponent is suggesting that VPM would make taxation even more difficult. I agree that this would likely be the case, but I would also point out that this is merely because it is currently a practice that is not recognized by the state. Marriage reform tends to necessitate tax reform. Introducing either interracial marriage or same-sex marriage into a system that criminalized and discriminated against them would likely force some kind of marriage-related tax reform. My opponent\"s argument here can only be taken seriously if s/he also discourages interracial and same-sex marriage. 3-\"Relationships should be between two people.\" This is entirely without grounding or warrant. To use an earlier example, it could be just as easy to say \"relationships should be between two people of the same race\" or \"relationships should be between people of different sexes.\" Merely stating these things is not a good reason to criminalize interracial or same-sex marriage. 4-\"Couples have to... there\"s multiple people.\" Following my opponent\"s logic here would yield disastrous results. For example, families also have to make decisions and compromises together. It is harder to agree when there are more people. Having children increases the number of people in a family. Therefore, people should not have children. Of course, if everybody did this, it would result in human extinction. 5-\"Polygamous relationships can... is already overpopulated.\" Actually, because the female reproductive system can only create a single child at a time (discounting multiple births), any form of polygamy could not increase the population more than monogyny could (assuming a roughly equal proportion of men and women in the world). 6-\"Polygamy is almost... being owned by men.\" Remember, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. If the woman\"s act is not voluntary, then it is not relevant to this debate. 7-\"Marriage is a... a cattle drive.\" A VPM can also be a partnership and a relationship; it is simply between more people. 8-\"Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women.\" This is true. I fail to see how this is necessarily disadvantageous. 9-\"Most people agree... to older men.\" Again, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. Joel Feinberg classifies the choice of a child as \"substantially nonvoluntary.\"[3] I think many people would agree. 10-\"Spouses can have... it creates tension.\" This is true. Marriage is difficult, but I fail to see how this justifies laws against VPM. 11-\"The established needs... around the house.\" My opponent has offered no evidence to support this. Even if s/he had, it would not provide a convincing justification for laws against VPM. 12-\"In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status.\" This seems unlikely, especially when you consider that there are societies in which polyandry is the predominant form of polygamy.[4] Even if this were the case, my opponent would also have to show that polygamy is the cause of this lower in each of these cultures for this argument to have much weight. 13-\"True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people.\" Even if this were the case, it is not a good justification for laws against VPM because \"true love\" is not a prerequisite for marriage. 14-\"Most North American... or food stamps.\" That is unfortunate, but unless my opponent is suggesting that VPM is the cause of this, the argument does not hold much weight. If s/he is suggesting that VPM is the cause, then the argument seems to be guilty of a cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 15-\"Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices.\" I agree. 16-\"Legalizing polygamy would... on women\"s rights.\" This is completely unwarranted; I could just as easily say \"legalizing VPM would not give more power to religions and would not infringe on women\"s rights.\" Also, in terms of women\"s rights, I would also like to remind my opponent that the resolution deals with VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage and that a woman has just as much right to marry multiple men. 17-\"Legal polygamy would... to such marriages.\" My opponent assumes that nations are obligated to grant citizenship to immigrants merely because they are married to a citizen of that nation. However, my opponent offered no reason for us to accept this assumption. Some final notes: I-While my opponent offered a larger number of arguments, a multitude of arguments should not be confused for acumen. II-Though I have argued against my opponent\"s new arguments, s/he offered them in a round dedicated to rebuttals, and because of this, I was given far less opportunity to rebut them. III-My opponent did not refute my initial arguments. This is incredibly important because it means that my final syllogism, which firmly negates the resolution, stands. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Also, any new arguments against this portion of my initial argument would be incredibly unfair to the spirit of this debate as I am now completing my final round and would be unable to respond to them. So, ultimately, my syllogism has been unrefuted and its ultimate conclusion that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just must stand.

I would first like to address my definition of polygamy, which has gone unrefuted. Talbott\"s definition of legal paternalism is \"the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard).[1] This definition is important because it supports the first premise of my syllogism in C3. Next, my argument in C1 went unrefuted as well. This Millian argument showed that a certain type of legal paternalism (strong/hard) is not just. This argument is significant because it proves the second premise of my syllogism in C3. My opponent also failed to refute my argument in C2. This showed that laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism because they fail to meet the criteria of such forms of paternalism. This argument is important because it supports the third premise of my syllogism in C3. Finally, with all of the premises of my syllogism warranted, my conclusion (that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just) necessarily follows. As a reminder, the following is the syllogism to which I am referring. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) I have already supported 1-3. 4 follows from a disjunctive syllogism of premises 1 and 3. Because laws against polygamy are a type of paternalism, which is either strong/hard or weak soft and laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not weak/soft, they must be strong/hard. 5, which disproves the resolution, necessarily follows because of the rules of identity on 2 and 4. Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism, strong/hard paternalism is not just; thus, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. This relies on the same reasoning that tells us that when A=B and B=C that A=C. [1] Talbott, William. \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism.\" Which Rights Should Be Universal? Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print. (Pg. 53)', 'As far as I can tell, the only mention of polygamy in debates here so far have been in passing, so I hope everyone can enjoy looking at it a little bit closer. With debates concerning same-sex marriage currently taking over cable news channels, quite a bit has been said about \"the sanctity of marriage. \" People have questioned whether marriage should only be between one man and one woman or if it can also extend to one man and another man or one woman and another woman. While a great amount can be said about this subject, I turn my attention instead to a single word used in the rhetoric; that word is \"one. \" It seems that whether groups are advocating same-sex marriage or rejecting it, they believe that marriage is a commitment between one person and one other person only. On some level, this reflects the anti-polygamy sentiment of modern society. In fact, Edward Stein states \"that polygamy has never been legal in any [U. S. ] state. \" He adds that the U. S. Supreme Court \"effectively denied that there is a right to marry more than one person at the same time\" in Reynolds v. United States. [1] In this debate, I will argue that is no just basis for laws against voluntary polygamous marriage. Before progressing any further, it would be beneficial to actually define polygamy. Generally, polygamy can be defined as marriage between more than two partners. Alan S. Miller and Satoshi Kanazawa note that polygamy is often confused with polygyny. They add that \"polygyny is the marriage of one man to more than one woman. \" On the other hand, polygamy can also include polyandry, \"the marriage of one woman to more than one man. \"[2] It should be mentioned that both polygyny and polyandry require that the relationship be heterosexual; I will not give much consideration to homosexual polyamory in this debate because doing so would require even more complex distinctions than those already made and does not even meet the technical definition of polygamy. Additionally, I would no like to define an important term in my arguments, which is legal paternalism. In \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism,\" William Talbott explains that \"[a] law is paternalistic if it is enacted to promote the good of the target audience by overruling their own judgment about what is good for them. \" He adds that \"[l]egal paternalism is the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard). [3] C1-I would like to first explore why some kinds of paternalism (strong/hard) can be considered unjust. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill makes a convincing argument against legal paternalism being just. Mill claims that \"neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. \" He explains that this is because \"[h]e is the person most interested in his own well-being, the interest which any other person… can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has\" and \"with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by anyone else. \"[4] So, Mill suggests that a fully-capable adult is the most reliable judges on what is good for her because no other person is as interested in that person\\'s good as she is. Of course, this means that other people as well as governments are less reliable judges. Thus, legal paternalism is generally not justified. Mill does provide some exceptions to this; such exceptions are weak/soft paternalism. C2-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage do not meet the standards of either major theory of weak/soft paternalism. A-They do not meet Mill\\'s standards. In fact, Mill directly addresses polygamy. He explains that the particular Mormon belief \"which is the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy. \"[5]. Mill admits that he strongly disapproves of the practice, but he concludes that polygamy should not be prohibited. He notes \"that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a wife at all. \"[6] Whether or not the latter claim here represents an outdated worldview, the prior is certainly still relevant today. B-They do not meet Joel Feinberg\\'s standards. In \"Legal Paternalism,\" Feinberg describes a weak form of paternalism. According to Feinberg, \"the state has the right to prevent self-regarding harmful conduct when but only when it is substantially nonvoluntary or when temporary intervention is necessary to establish whether it is voluntary or not. \"[7] Such an intervention is certainly paternalistic, but it is a weak form of paternalism and, as such, is justifiable. Feinberg describes a voluntary act as one that \"represent[s] the agent faithfully in some important way… [and] express[es] his or her settled values and preferences. \"[8] If the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed about the particular circumstances of his or action, that action would not be considered voluntary. So, another person would be justified in preventing the agent from acting if that person believed the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed. However, such an intervener would be justified in intervening long enough to establish whether the agent\\'s action is voluntary or not. Of course, the resolution deals with voluntary polygamous marriage, so laws against it certainly are not weak/soft. In Harm to Self, Feinberg addresses polygamy more directly. He asserts that \"there are no convincing liberal reasons for the\" prohibition of polygamy. Feinberg then makes the slightly stronger claim \"that there should be no such crime [against polygamy] at all\". [9] This seems consistent with his account from \"Legal Paternalism. \" If an act is clearly voluntary, then paternalistic intervention is not justified. C3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. To prove this, I offer the following syllogism based on my arguments so far. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Sources: [1] Stein, Edward. \"Past and Present Proposed Amendments to the United States Constitution Regarding Marriage. \" Washington University Law Quarterly 82.3 (2004): 611-685.

It would be difficult for the government to tax. Relationships should be between two people. Couples have to make decisions and compromises together, and it’s harder to agree when there’s multiple people. Polygamous relationships can end up with too many children. The world is already overpopulated. Polygamy is almost never polyandry. It’s not about women’s freedom to choose who they marry or how many spouses they have- it’s about women being owned by men. Marriage is a partnership and a relationship. Polygamy turns marriage into a cattle drive. Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women. Most people agree that countries that practice polygamy live in an oppressive, abusive society with fanatical, religious men- especially when they marry young girls to older men. Spouses can have animosity, jealousy, etc towards other the other spouses and it creates tension. The established needs are impossible to meet in a polygamist marriage. These needs include- ongoing affection/attention, conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and help around the house. In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status. True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people. Most North American “families” in polygamous situations are on welfare or food stamps. Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices. Legalizing polygamy would give more power to religions, and would infringe on women’s rights. Legal polygamy would turn immigration into a nightmare. An immigrant can claim to be wed to half a nation of women and demand that all these women be brought to, say, the US. Polygamists can arrive at the border and demand refugee status because of persecution. Sorting out these claims would be impossible, since most nations refuse to give legal status to such marriages.', 'I accept.One thing though.Just: guided by truth, reason, justice, and fairness.[1]Polygamy: the practice or condition of having more than one spouse,especially wife, at one time.[2]Sources:[1] http://dictionary.reference.com...[2] http://dictionary.reference.com...;', 'I did not check every state\\'s laws for everything. I searched three reliable sites for \"States that have laws against girls playing American Football\", and I did not find anything against them playing football. The biggest thing against women playing football was that they should find a different sport to play. Others call it \"Abusive\" for a woman to play football. However, I do not find this t obe abusive, and if it happened to be abusive, you could not blame coaches, teamates, or the opposing team, you blame her for getting into this game. This was a very fine debate. Thank you for your time, and good luck.', 'Reading the laws of other states, there is no law that says something like 7B: Women can\\'t play football with men. There are absolutely no laws in other states that say that women can\\'t play football. With my football experience, I have seen girls playing the sport. You know too,we played Atrisco Valley, and that girl who played as well, if not better, than some of the boys we have seen playing. Also, I have seen in a few, but not all of the High Schools have at least one girl playing for their team.There is one girl division The Augusta National division, which is for girls. Also, with some research I have found that there are girl football divisions in Germany. Not the \"soccer\" type football, as they call it in England, but actual American-type football. So yes, there are girl divisions for American football.', \"Many people say that women can not play football. However, I have found that when they say this, they say women are weak. Women are not given the chance to try football past the Young American Football League (YAFL). But if men think women can't play because of politics, they are not familiar with the laws. You can not put anybody under you, all men are created equal. he only league that prohibits women from completely playing is the NFL. So yes, girls have all the right to play outside the NFL.\", \"First of all, Did you read the Youth Football rules for all 49 other states? Also, as the age increase for players, so does the competitiveness among players. When you have read the NMAA rules for High School football then you can rebuke me, but until then your argument on youth rules is invalid. YAFL allows females to play because, although we are competitive, we will not intentionally hurt them unless a player is a sociopath. I'm not doubting a women;s ability to play football I'm just saying that they would be a distraction and would not all be able to play the amount of required playing time. Don't get me wrong, omen can play but very few have the stamina and concentration to compete at the high school level. Let me ask you something, specifically what playing level are we talking about? you started with Professional but then we moved to high school and YAFL. There is another youth football league on the East Coast ( POP WARNER ) that encourages women play the good sport of football, but like I said before there is no platform for women's professional football anywhere in our country....

The main difference however, is the storytelling aspect of dance. Dance exists to tell a story through movement and music. That is something sports simply do not do.

In reality, even reports suggesting a 6.6% gap [28] have had errors pointed out in them. Academic Christina Hoff Sommers [29] writes: \"Economics majors (66 percent male) have a median income of $70,000; for sociology majors (68 percent female) it is $40,000. Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute has pointed to similar incongruities. The AAUW study classifies jobs as diverse as librarian, lawyer, professional athlete, and \"media occupations\" under a single rubric--\"other white collar.\" \"One report from the U.S. Dept. of Labor shows that the pay gap is \"almost entirely\" due to individual choices, and not discrimination [30]. d) Bias in Wikipedia [The Guardian, 2015] Wikipedia were recently forced to ban 5 editors fron Gender-related articles [31]. 7.

But the only thing Obama will do is expand Washington's power and control like WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN OUR 200+ YEARS AS A COUNTRY (with exception to the New Deal, from the socialist democrat darling FDR). Through nationalized health care, increasing taxes, environmental protectionism, business and corporate regulation, and more bureaucracy, Obama's future plan for Washington makes no sense at all with his original claim. If Washington is the problem and we need change, expanding Washington's power and control is the exact opposite solution that we need. His stance makes no sense and is completely irrational.\", '\"Okay, so let\\'s stop taxing companies. Then our government will be even more broken, because it won\\'t be able to pay for anything. Good idea.\" I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms. It is the upper class that runs the businesses that the lower class works. \"And I guarantee you they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes.\" Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \"Taxing to pay for government programs isn\\'t Marxist. And guess waht? The government has the right, BY THE CONSTITUTUION, to tax.\" Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. And for taxes (from the Wall Street Journal): \"Mr. Obama has recently veered sharply left. He now proposes to solve the looming Social Security shortfall exclusively with higher taxes. …Currently, all wages below about $100,000 are subject to a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax. But all wages above that amount are not subject to the tax. Mr. Obama wants to eliminate the cap, but, in a concession to taxpayers, exempt wages between $100,000 and $200,000. …Mr. Obama\\'s plan would keep Social Security in the black for only three additional years. Under his proposal, annual deficits would hit in 2020, instead of 2017. By the 2030s the system would still run an annual deficit exceeding $150 billion. Mr. Obama\\'s modest improvements to Social Security\\'s financing come at a steep cost. …The top marginal federal tax rates would effectively increase to 50.3% from 37.9%, equivalent to repealing the Bush income tax cuts almost three times over. If one accounts for behavioral responses, even the modest budgetary improvements from Mr. Obama\\'s plan are likely to be overstated. If employers reduce wages to cover their increased payroll-tax liabilities, these wages would no longer be subject to state or federal income taxes, or Medicare taxes. A 2006 study by Harvard economist and Obama adviser Jeffrey Liebman concluded that roughly 20% of revenue increases from raising the tax cap would be offset by declining non-Social Security taxes. Assuming modest negative behavioral responses, Mr. Liebman projected an additional 30% reduction in net revenues, leaving barely half the intended revenue intact. Mr. Obama\\'s plan would also dramatically raise incentives for tax evasion, further degrading revenue gains. Many high-earning individuals evade the Medicare payroll tax by setting up \"S Corporations,\" paying themselves in untaxed dividends rather than taxable wages. John Edwards avoided $590,000 in Medicare taxes this way in the 1990s. …The U.S. already collects far more Social Security taxes from high earners than other countries do. Social Security taxes here are currently capped at about three times the national average wage — far above other developed countries. In Canada and France payroll taxes are levied only up to the average wage. In the United Kingdom, taxes stop at 1.15 times the average wage; in Germany and Japan at 1.5 times.\" Barack Obama is a radical leftist.', '\"This fallacy is that the only possible way to fix governmental problems is to limit the government. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems.\" I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem. His solution is to expand Washington like we\\'ve never seen. How does his position make any sense? \"On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people.\" Since when was it the government\\'s responsibility to provide health care for its people? It is no where in the Constitution. Health care is not a right. And dont even get me started on the expenses of national healthcare for 300,000,000 people. \"On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational. The government is \"broken\" here because it is inefficient in protecting the environment. Obama wants to change that.\" a) global warming is a crock of sh**. b) carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Even if you believe in global warming hysteria, the percentage of pollution caused from CO2 (businesses) is minimal. Putting the environment as a priority of the economy is mentally insane. Obama wants to tax carbon emissions from the corporate and business sector which would seriously cripple and hurt our economy. It would be a complete disaster. This is the liberal agenda...ideology over common sense. \"On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot... The government is \"broken\" here because it fails to keep these companies in line.\" Hmm, do you know why companies are outsourcing? MAYBE BECAUSE OF THE IDIOT CONGRESSMAN (ALMOST ENTIRELY LIBERALS AND A FEW FAKE REPUBLICANS) WHO TAX THE HELL OUT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. How do liberals not get it? Do you see what\\'s happening in California? Companies are moving out of CA like wildfire because the legislature in the golden state is taxing the hell of them. Companies are moving to Nevada and Arizona, and California\\'s economy is beginning to suffer. \"On taxes, Obama wants to repeal certain tax cuts on the upper classes in order to pay for these programs.\" Where in the Constitution does it talk about wealth redistribution? This is a tactic right out of the Marxist playbook. Why are liberals so fond of socialism? Have they not learned from history? \"Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational.\" Ya thats a brilliant idea. Let\\'s raise taxes (at a rate we\\'ve never seen in our lives) during a time in our country where our economy is in a recession and our consumer confidence level is at a 26 year low. THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL. How does raising taxes during an economic crisis make any sense whatsoever?', 'First, I\\'d like to point out that my opponent has dropped every point but the point about taxes. So, I will only be focusing on this in the final round, and you can assume that the CON won those points, since he obviously has no response. Right here, since he didn\\'t flow thorugh with the other issues, I should win on a basic cost-benefit analysis. But I\\'ll show you why he\\'s wrong about taxes before letting you get to the vote. \"I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms. It is the upper class that runs the businesses that the lower class works. \" Supply-side economics are no guarantee. You also brought up that taxing more is bad because of the recession. BUt, individuals (both people and companies) tend to spend less during recessions, which only makes matters worse. So, if we get more money to the government for programs so they can SPEND THAT MONEY, it actually helps the problems of the recession. You see, the government is pretty much guaranteed to spend that money. So, it\\'s not making the recession worse at all to tax. \"Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \" You just contradicted yourself. You said that they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes, and then you say taht they outsource because of taxes. Which is it? The fact of the matter is, you\\'re blaming outsourcing on overtaxing (when you haven\\'t even given numbers as to this overtaxing), when they\\'ll do it either way. Things like this are why Obama wants some regulation. \"Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. \" And you missed the point of my original argument. It\\'s not a redistribution of wealth. It\\'s taxing so we can pay for government programs. That\\'s basic. And I\\'m glad that you brought up that Wall Street Journal article, because you obviously didn\\'t read it. It\\'s just paraphrased. Actually, you didn\\'t even paraphrase it, did you? No. You took the paraphrasing from Cato at Liberty, which is the blog of the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think-tank. Here\\'s the page you got it from: . http://www.cato-at-liberty.org... So. .. You\\'re basically taking something out of context that a BIASED THINK TANK took out of context. Here\\'s the real article is: . http://online.wsj.com... It\\'s of course talking about his plan to deal with social security. This is my favorite part: \"His proposal would be a very large tax hike, yet it won\\'t be enough. \" It continues: \"Mr. Obama\\'s plan fixes less than half of Social Security\\'s long-term deficit, making further tax increases inevitable. The Policy Simulation Group\\'s Gemini model estimates that Mr. Obama\\'s proposal, if phased as Mr. Obama suggests, would solve only part of the problem. A 10 year phase-in, for example, would address only 43% of Social Security\\'s 75-year shortfall. And this is assuming that Congress would save the surplus from the tax increases -- almost $600 billion over 10 years -- rather than spending it, as Congress does now. \" I\\'ll let you read the rest of it for yourself. So, you see, the problem isn\\'t that the taxes are messing things up, as you\\'re trying to imply. In fact, the problem is that the taxes aren\\'t enough! If anything, it would require more taxes! Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent only has the point of taxes left going into Round Four, and this doesn\\'t even flow through. He used his sources out of context and wrong, when in fact they supported a point contrary to what he was trying to get across. Even if you want to accept a few of his points, even if you think that Obama isn\\'t the right choice for president, he has, in no way, proven that Obama is irrational.', 'Oh, and just watch the straw man burn... \"I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem. His solution is to expand Washington like we\\'ve never seen. How does his position make any sense?\" No. He\\'s saying that Washington has problems. He\\'s suggesting ways to fix these problems. There are multiple ways to fix these problems, and Obama\\'s plan is one. It\\'s not irrational. In fact, it\\'s very rationally founded. \"Since when was it the government\\'s responsibility to provide health care for its people? It is no where in the Constitution. Health care is not a right. And don\\'t even get me started on the expenses of national healthcare for 300,000,000 people.\" I never said it was in the Constitution. I never said it was a responsibility. I never said that it was a right. And Obama\\'s plan is to get every American on one system, as you are claiming. He\\'s trying to fix it so that those who need health care but can\\'t afford it can get it. Whether it\\'s in the Constitution or not, the government is there because of the social contract. Therefore, it provides for it\\'s citizens. Obama is trying to suggest a way to make the government provide for the citizenry better, whether it is required to or not. This is not irrational. \"a) global warming is a crock of sh**. b) carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.

Obama wants to tax carbon emissions from the corporate and business sector which would seriously cripple and hurt our economy. It would be a complete disaster. This is the liberal agenda...ideology over common sense.\" 1.) I never said anything about global warming. I was talking about pollution. Whether global warming is real or fake, we should protect the environment. Whether global warming is real or fake, I like being able to breathe. 2.) On the whole CO2 thing...

Can you tell me where? Because so far you\\'ve just ranted about how much you hate taxes. Now, look at the resolution and my opponent\\'s original case. He\\'s claiming that Barack is irrational because the government has problems and he\\'s proposing to expand the government in certain areas. What my opponent fails to recognize is these expanisons are made to address these governmental problems. They\\'re made to correct innefficiencies. This has worked in the past. Replacing the Articles of Confederation with the Constitution. The Square Deal. The New Deal. And, as a matter of fact, these solutions are rationally founded. There is no reason why a government can\\'t correct itself, which is what my opponent is implying. It\\'s irrelevant as to whether you agree with Obama or not. It\\'s irrelevant as to whether you think he\\'s plans will work or not. What matters is that these solutions are RATIONALLY FOUNDED.', 'Thank you for starting the debate. My opponent\\'s entire argument reasts on a logical fallacy. This fallacy is that the only possible way to fix governmental problems is to limit the government. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems. Now, looking at my opponent\\'s case against Obama point by point. On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people. On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational. The government is \"broken\" here because it is inefficient in protecting the environment. Obama wants to change that. On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot. Some regulation is a good thing in order to keep these companies in line so they serve Americans as best they can. The government is \"broken\" here because it fails to keep these companies in line. On taxes, Obama wants to repeal certain tax cuts on the upper classes in order to pay for these programs. I realize a lot of people don\\'t like taxes, but the money for correcting these problems has to come from somewhere. Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational. As far as the bureaucracy goes, I don\\'t\\' see any evidence for this. It really just seems like a straw man argument. In order for you to accept my opponent\\'s case, you have to accept that the only rational solution to governmental problems is libertarianism. While I do not negate the possible advantages of libertarianism, it is not the openly rational solution. There is no reason why putting certain governmental programs in place can\\'t correct certain problems. Just because you don\\'t think Obama\\'s plan is the best doesn\\'t make it irrational.', \"Alright. First things first (I'm the realest..gosh that song's old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, let's again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, I'd like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isn't anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up. Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues. After all, what good is trying to organize countries at war?\", 'First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. I\\'d like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldn\\'t be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I don\\'t believe that\\'s a large enough amount to carry any significance in it. As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. I\\'d like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these \"superwars\" that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000). Next, wars don\\'t occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed country\\'s biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesn\\'t take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention. We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also. War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.', 'As for the topic of the debate: I do believe that global warming is not our greatest issue. World peace is an issue of the utmost urgency. Pro states that despite having wars, \"we are still alive and \\'healthy. \\'\" However, I\\'d like to point out that our world is in turmoil today. Global warming only causes fiercer storms, while the agitation in the world produces a much sharper hunger for a reaction.', 'Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the \"point of no return.\" Haven\\'t heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a \"runaway\" in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things don\\'t change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we don\\'t stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the world\\'s economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isn\\'t very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroy\\'s their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?', \"First, this is my first time debating, so apologizes for some mistakes Argument: Hunger you say? That's going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesn't kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years? [1] http://goo.gl...\", 'Global Warming. It is our biggest issue. I didn\"t choose world peace because we were always be fighting. For as long as we have lived, we have fought. And yet, we are still alive and \"healthy\". Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isn\"t going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, it\"s evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that it\"s incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.', 'First I may have the burden of proof but my opponent still needs to prove his case and back it up, and show proof of his claims. opponents first refutation.The roots of my argument is not what he claims. The basis of my position is that pornographic actors are the same as prostitutes. Since prostitution is illegal, and since porn stars are just legal prostitutes. Then pornography(legal prostitution rings) should be illegal. Also Pornography includes child porn witch my opponent never even tackled. Also porn sites easily allow children to break the law and veiw porn. witch is illegal. lastly that pornography Is detrimental. In my case I am not saying that pornography is a direct cause of rape, But that pornography is a major contributing factor, influence,and promotes rape....etc.....he says showing kids watch this stuff is irrelevant......Not true children viewing pornography is illegal. Since were talking about legality this is obviously relevant. Also I don\\'t need to show why pornography should be legal. Thats my opponents job. Also my opponent no where in this entire debate explained why pornography should be legal. He attempted to tackle my case but forgot to validate his own.Also if people in a marriage are curious about sex then get under the covers with your partner. Get in the boat and make some waves. Don\\'t look at porn when you have a perfectly good partner whom your married to and can have sex with. Why fantasise about sex rather than having sex????\" as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image.\"Untrue no wife respects the fact that the husband feels he has to look at porn rather than having sex with him. Because the husband chooses to look at other women this causes the wife to feel unwanted. So viewing porn actually hurts the spouses self esteem........Pornography could make it difficult for your spouse to see sex as a loving form of communication. As a result, pornography can decrease sexual satisfaction within your marriage.my opponents second rebuttalfirst let m prove that pornography is addictive............http://en.wikipedia.org...If you feel that not enough look at the sources cited within my source. So pornography is obviously the cause of porn addiction( just think of the wording). Also if the problem is not enough sex with the spouse. then either divorce them and go find sex or cheat. Don\\'t veiw pornography because its detrimental. especially while married. My opponent says...\" a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. Please lets emphasize on the word A. Yes it is one cause but there is one universal reason people veiw porn. to see legal prostitutes have sex or masturbate. Here\\'s evidence that masturbation decreases penile sensitivity........http://www.medhelp.org.........look at the first couple of comments ..........here\\'s a better source............http://www.articledashboard.com...It affects our country because we have a legal prostitution industry. If porn actors are legal , then prostitution should be legalized. But since its not, and since were a count, based on fairness since prostitution is illegal then pornography should be illegal because porn actors are just prostitutes. Lastly pornography doesnt cause rape but promotes it. Due to the fact that after viewing you of coarse want to have sex. Some cant get a partner. After a while some may get too frustrated and just decide to rape someone because there so backed up.....lol...( my opponent never effectively commented on this).Sex isnt the only thing that porn shows. It shows pictures, masturbation, bondage,masturbation,children,and bestiality. Educating people about sex wont prevent rape. Nor will it change any probability of how porn effects the brain.( just to point this out my opponent calls porn a vile insidious substance, witch supports my case)Lastly if porn is illegal and no one had access to it then people wont have to worry about jail because they couldn\\'t get there hands on it. If I was wrong and they could . Then since its illegal then obviously some legal punishment needs to occur. Are you suggesting that the legal system do nothing if it was illegal??? MY opponents counter to my second argument:My argument is not faulty my opponents counter is faulty though......So since prostitution is illegal and since the person chooses to do it then its not illegal????? This is what my opponent is trying to convince the voter of. Faulty logic.He also says he wants to legalize prostitution. If we legalize prostitution, People who get kidnapped and forced into it may never be found. Since there\\'s no police involvement how will these kidnappies be rescued???? Also in prostitution were to be legalised, we all know there is alot of drugs and gang bang rape. The prostitute may think its just a normal have sex with the john and then go. But behind that dark alley or hotel room door there may be 10 men waiting to rape them. If it was legal then these instances would increase dramatically. Since there would be no police hounding here activity.My opponent says porn reduces crimenot true. His source for his statistics are invalid. To test this hypothesis we would need to know whos going to commit crime before hand. We would also need to find out if these criminals are veiwing porn before they commit crime. The after we know theve been caught and done the crime then we could possibly make a conclusion.....since this experiment is impossible since we don\\'t know who\\'s going to commit a crime before hand this is not valid. In my case I have proven that rape promotes rape or is a contributing factor psychologically. therefore this point shouldn\\'t even be considered.Also about his fifth source a conclusion cannot be made unless we know at what year this study was conducted. Thus not valid.Also I never said that pornography causes rape crimes. My point is that pornography may promote rape and is a contributing factor. Since my opponent cannot successfully rebuttal this, it still is valid.EconomyIf the porn industry was abolished that money could be spent else where to stimulate our economy. Or atleast keep some extra money in our pockets. Also Not all porn has a cost. Most people look at free porn. Lastly we don\\'t have a porn taxabout the first amendmentporn is dissemination. But so is terrorist activity on the web. So in my opponents logic we should allow terrorists to share info of terror via the Internet......... The limit on dissemination is if there is threat or if it contradicts the law. Since prostitution is against the law and since prostitution is the same as porn actors then this contradicts the law.freedom of expression from government interference.........if this is the case then why does the government tax us.Lastly the constitution does not protect porn. Freedom of speech and freedom of action are two different things....prostitution is not freedom of speech it is a obscene act unacceptable in our society and is a action.Also porn is considered obscene and obscenity is not protected by the constitution................http://www.covenanteyes.com...( im out of characters, Please look at my case)Sourceshttp://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://downloads.frc.org......http://downloads.frc.org......http://www.heritage.org......http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org......http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://www.protectkids.com......http://www.covenanteyes.com....http://www.articledashboard.com....http://www.medhelp.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...', 'I will be defending the fact that pornography shouldn\\'t be legal do to some fundamental facts. I will use logic and studies to prove my case.Pornography- is the depiction of sexual behavior that is intended to arouse sexual excitement in its audience. prostitute- a person who receives payment for sexual intercourse or other sexual acts, generally as a regular occupation.porn industry-consists of businesses which either directly or indirectly provide sex-related products and services or adult entertainment. The porn industry includes adult sex-related products and services such as prostitution in all its forms.pornographic actors/porn star- Most notably these performers are not paid directly by their sexual partners for the sex, but both are paid through a studio or Talent Management Agency.I will explain that pornography is detrimental,allows children to illegally view pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Pornographic actors is the same as prostitution,Also pornography includes all of its branches. Witch means my opponent will need to defend child porn,animal porn etc.....1.Pornography is detrimental to societyDaily \"child pornography\" requests---- 116,000Websites offering illegal child pornography----- 100,000Adults admitting to Internet sexual addiction----10%http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com...KEY FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHYTHE FAMILY AND PORNOGRAPHY• Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their conjugal relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Wives notice and are upset by the difference.• Pornography use is a pathway to infidelity and divorce, and is frequently a major factor in these family disasters.• Among couples affected by one spouse’s addiction, two-thirds experience a loss of interest in sexual intercourse.• Both spouses perceive pornography viewing as tantamount to infidelity.http://downloads.frc.org...THE INDIVIDUAL AND PORNOGRAPHY• Pornography is addictive, • Users tend to become desensitized to the type of pornography they use, become bored with it, and then seek more perverse forms of pornography.• Men who view pornography regularly have a higher tolerance for abnormal sexuality, including rape, sexual aggression, and sexual promiscuity. Child-sex offenders are more likely to view pornography regularly or to be involved in its distribution.OTHER EFFECTS http://downloads.frc.org...Pornography, distorts an individual’s concept of sexual relations by objectifying them, which, in turn, alters both sexual attitudes and behavior. It is a major threat to marriage, to family, to children, and to individual happiness.Social scientists, clinical psychologists, and biologists concur.http://www.heritage.org...Effect on the mind: Pornography is very addictive. Some effects of porn addiction are: Escalation/Desensitization: Addicts experience an ever-increasing lust and a craving for more intense porn. Eventually \"soft-core\" porn is not stimulating enough, which pushes them into \"hard-core.\" It is a downward spiral. Dissatisfaction with your sex life: Spouses of addicts are affected as sex does not satisfy the addict as it once did. Men who look at porn are dissatisfied by their wife\\'s appearance and this often leads to dysfunctional relationships. Addiction to masturbation: Those addicted to porn are almost always addicted to masturbation. The sexual urges become so strong that masturbation becomes the easiest way of release. Shame and guilt: Emotional pain is perhaps the most common effect of porn addiction. A deep sense of failure and shame is often experienced. \"Lonerism\" and Secrecy: Porn addicts generally keep to themselves and keep their addiction secret. This often results in dysfunctional relationships. http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org... Pornography affects people’s emotional lives. Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their marital sexual relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Women married to men with a pornography addiction report feelings of betrayal, mistrust, and anger. Pornographic use may lead to infidelity and even divorce. Adolescents who view pornography feel shame, diminished self-confidence, and sexual uncertainty. http://downloads.frc.org... Pornography hurts adults, children, couples, families, and society. Either by promoting overly aggressive,child pornography,Pornography has significant effects during all stages of family life. For a child exposed to pornography within a family setting, pornography causes stress and increases the risk for developing negative attitudes about the nature and purpose of human sexuality. For adolescents who view pornography, their attitudes toward their own and others’ sexuality change, and their sexual expectations and behavior are shaped accordingly. For adults, pornography has harmful and even destructive effects on marriage. Pornography is more detrimental then beneficial thus should not be practiced. 2.allows children to illegally veiw pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Porn sites don\\'t do much to prevent children from viewing. There required by law to ask if your 18 or 21 in some states. On most if not all porn sites you just have to press a button. Yes or no. There\\'s no birthday check or anything like that witch could single children out to disallow access. Porn is very much available to children. Access to pornography is available from early on. The average age of a child’s first exposure to pornography is 11. A total of 90 percent of children ages 8-16 have viewed pornography online. Pornographers use many character names that appeal to children such as “Pokémon.”.........http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com... According to The Kaiser Family Foundation report (found at www.kff.org), 70% of teenagers (ages 15-17 \"have accidentally come across pornography on the Web.\"....... According to one study, early exposure (under fourteen years of age) to pornography is related to greater involvement in deviant sexual practice, particularly rape. Slightly more than one-third of the child molesters and rapists in this study claimed to have at least occasionally been incited to commit an offense by exposure to pornography. Among the child molesters incited, the study reported that 53 percent of them deliberately used the stimuli of pornography as they prepared to offend...........http://www.protectkids.com... W. L. Marshall, \"The Use of Sexually Explicit Stimuli by Rapists, Child Molesters, ,\" The Journal of Sex Research 25, no.2 (May 1988): 267-88. 3.porn actors same as prostitutes. If you look at the definitions there very similar. If you think about it morally they provide the same services for a fee. Since the porn industry advertises these porn stars,(just as pimps advertise prostitutes)and since the workers are offering sex for money,( just like prostitutes). it ought to be illegal as well. Morally atleast. Also this could be under obscenity witch is not protected in anyway morally. the only difference with porn stars is that there under the camera, have a director,its legal,they sign a contract. This is just legal prostitution. Another point I want to make is that pornography includes all branches of pornography. That means child porn, animal porn, etc.......my opponent needs to defend it. So in my case I have effectively proven,That pornography is more detrimental than good, Allows children to illegally veiw porn due to inadequate age confirmation systems, and lastly that porn actors are the same as prostitutes thus should be treated the same as prostitutes and thus pornography should be illegal.', 'My position is pretty obvious. I will prove that pornography is immoral for unobvious reasons.( atleast i think there unobvious reasons....lol) and should be illegal and that the bad outweighs the good. I hope to have a great debate.', 'BOP- My opponent has it as she advocates a chance in the status quo, is an instigator, and is PRO. As she has not specified otherwise I say he has the BOP. --Refutations--My opponents C1:The basis of my opponents argument is it hurts family, and mainly kids through addiction. The argument on who watches the type of video is irrelevant, as if I refute the premise below, then the argument is defeated. The majority of my opponents argument after showing kids watch this stuff (irrelevant), she shows things like it is detrimental to the marriage institution. My opponents only links the cons on a marriage, but does not show the pros and the intermediates. Many people who are really holy holy marriage people may, you know, become curious. But they may think look at this slu*, she does not enjoy her husband. Some people say pornography is good for the sexual imagination, and moderate usage may enhance sex life. Some less committed woman may actually approve of the watching of pornography, as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image. If she thinks she has a good one, it should not really effect her. [1]My opponent then contends it is addictive, causes rape, and they may become desensitized. I will first refute the addiction part of it. There is actually a controversy on whether it is addictive or not, whether it is the porn or some other aspect in life. Many contend it is outside arguments, and things that make it hard to even have a sex life that lead the to this hole. So the problem may not be the porn, rather a non sexual spouse. Others say if you treat them like addicts it may be detrimental to the viewer. [2] The basis of my opponents argument is flawed as there is a high controversy on the issue. He then claims they become desensitized. My question is so what? They get bored they can not watch it, or watch worse why does it effect you or the country? Why is it the governments job to intervene? Also, a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. So the best way to control it may be handing out free books :P. My opponent then claims it causes rape. I refer you to my arguments in C1.My opponents final argument is it changes the concept of the human brain, yet forgets any porn watching is not sex watching or a sex addiction. Sex requires two individuals procreating, or two individuals just doing their thing. Porn would unlikely effect sex life with education programs showing porn =/= sex. Education, not banning, may be a better way to control the vile insidious substance.---> Sex lifesee above.---> masturbation addiction kinda gross, but this does not hold up unless you show its bad. ---> shamecool. So making it illegal and if they watch it (hard to censor the internet) and throwing them in jail is better for the problem? No, legal porn and throwing them in education programs is better.---> Loner^^My opponents C2: The basis of my opponents full argument is the filters are not good enough. Well my opponent may have just conceded the argument right there. He said the filters, not the porn is the problem. Instead of taking away some creepy dudes fun away, mandate a filter, make current filters stronger. This here would fix all of the problems you listed, without abashment. Abloishment is not needed as you added in the words filter. He then says it makes kids rapist. See my C1.My opponents C3:My opponents argument is faulty even if it is correct, as porn stars CHOOSE to get into the job they are in. He also has to prove it is bad, as when you legalize prostitution it gets safer for them. [3] So making it legal not only helps the people, but makes it safer. And again, they CHOOSE to be there, not the governments business. --Case--C1: Porn reduces crime This argument is logically sound either way, as they spend more times watching this crap then grabbing people into alleys. \"The bottom line on these experiments is, \"More Net access [Porn], less rape.\" A 10 percent increase in Net access yields about a 7.3 percent decrease in reported rapes.\" [4]\"Results from the Czech Republic showed, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes have not increased following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. In addition, the study found that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible -- a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan.\"[5] Didn\\'t my opponent say it rose rape and moles rapes, yet I just proved it doesn\\'t without using bsse sources? (my opponent used frc). As I am low on space I must continue. C2: Economy \"The statistics are truly staggering. According to compiled numbers from respected news and research organizations, every second $3,075.64 is being spent on pornography.\" [6]Imagine it though! Banning it would likely be ineffective, but would still constrict this money supply to our economy. Aboloshment would be detrimental. Porn is worth 14 billion per year, that is huge. [7] Banning it woudl likely shrink our economy by 10 billion dollars, and piss off a lot of people. The economy benefits on porn, and banning it is actually counter productive economically. Also I forgot, we could tax it if it was legal ;).C3: 1st amendment the first amdnment-\"protects the right to freedom of religion and freedom of expression from government interference. \"[8]\"Despite popular misunderstanding the right to freedom of the press guaranteed by the first amendment is not very different from the right to freedom of speech. It allows an individual to express themselves through publication and dissemination\" [8]Internet counts as dissemination. [9] With this being said, this now makes it IMPOSSIBLE to ban pornogorphy under the constitution. Now, no matter what arguments in this debate happen if this argument stands I get an auto win. Conclusion: You cannot ban porn, it lowers crime, and it is bneficial to the economy. I think I have proven her arguments wrong or have semi-reufted them. Also to add, my opponent has not fufilled the BOP. Vote CON.http://www.debate.org...', 'I can devils advocate this I accept.', 'Yes, you have the BOP, and I have fulfilled it already, you have not. --First refutation--My opponent mixed the order, but ok. The argument here is they are prostitutes, therefore it should be illegal. My opponent now opens up a huge new debate on the sex laws. Now, the resolution states ought to be illegal, this means this argument too considers the \"ought\" factor. So, my opponent first must prove pornography, and in this argument prostitution should be illegal. Also the majority of his case says this is bad for women. The funny thing is, prostitutes, when legalized, have lower AIDS rates then when it is legal. [1] Now, when we make things illegal it becomes less clean, as we see from the drug war, and it is STILL used. And it would be extremely hard to censor it. The current porn industry has many scans for STD\\'s, one check every 30 days. [2] Now that is illegal, (assume your side prevails in the laws) then the industry WILL form a black market, and make it less safe. My opponents cause now stands defeated here, as the ought in the resolution acts in my favor.My opponent essentially conceded that children watching porn is illegal, which proves my point. It is impossible to ban this stuff, and a ban would to little to lower users, etc. In pakistan, they have a ban on this vile stuff, yet the amount of people watching it within the country is still high. [3] The basis of my opponents argument fails because even if we ban it it just enters a black market making it LESS SAFE, and the same problems with the porn industry live, and get worse (STD\\'s). My opponent then bolds the statement I have not justified my arguments below, which is false. I have explained the benefits of legal porn: Economic and crime wise, then I proved it was impossible to ban via 1st amendment. My opponent must have really not read me saying CASE, which is arguments for porn staying legal. Her bolded statement is false. I think ANY reader can see where my justification is.My opponents next argument is if your interested in intercourse, why not have intercourse. There are many reasons, nagging wives, a refusing wife, you do not want to risk pregnancy again or ever. There are many reasons to have fantasies then procreate with your wive. My opponent also only refutes one of the arguments I presented with the marriage thing. As stated, porn means some things to people, different things to other. [4] So some marriages it will not effect. It also teaches new techniques, discovers your sexuality with your wife, and helps find ways it \"turns you on\", therefore helping you and your spouse. [4] My opponent ONLY refuted ONE of the benefits presented, the it will not effect you if you have a good self image. This is a fact, as if you have confidence you will prevail. His case here is no woman would like a man watching a porn star, the funny thing is some marriages watch it together!! [4] Like: \"With the availability of porn at your fingertips couples using it together is a new phenomenon in many relationships. More and more couples are using pornography to help stimulate their sex life. \" [4]These couples have no problem with this, and my opponents case forgets the upsides to porn in a relationship. --Second-- My opponents argumet here is porn is addictive, \"look as the sources\", and I urge the same. There is actually evidence in that wikipedia article disagreeing with her, and states pornography addiction may not exist. Addiction is a usage of a drug or substance that changes mood, and has adverse effects on the body and mind. [5] Now my opponent has not proven it changes mood at all, just cites an FRC article saying it causes rape. It may not be the porn they are addicted too, but social life and moods make them visit these sites, which implies it is social life, not porn that is causing the so called addiction. [6]My opponents next comparison, again, opens up the debate to prostitution. As I am devils advocating this whole debate, let me argue for that statement too. Prostitution = more things to tax hence more revenues. Also it opens up a new economic market, and as stated lowers AIDS rates from prostitutes, from when they operate illegally, which they DO. My opponent has not proven prostitution \"ought\" to be banned. As this is the case, I win this argument too.My opponent then talks about it shows bestiality, yet he has no facts to prove any of his assertions. Her argument is education and rehab will not prevent rape, although porn already reduces rape numbers, my opponent ha snot proved how rehabilitation and education would not do anything. We can compare this to Portugal, they legalized drugs and rehab the people, it has worked great, and these people are addicted. No reason rehab would fail. My opponents argument then goes people would not have access. I refer to above. Abolishment would not work. --Third--God prostitution is all over this debate. My opponent then claims people would be kidnapped, like they are now. This is funny. Making it illegal causes the kidnaps as they need to get people to do it and convince them the police wont get them. In Nevada, where is is legal in certain areas, this never happens. My opponents argument is a fallacy, when t is sometimes the laws, not the practice that makes the problems. And remember the benefits of prostitution legalization above.__________________________________________________________________________________________________--Crime--My opponent claims my source is faulty, but this is funny as well. It looked at trends, needing to foresee the future is not needed in this case, this means your biased christian source [FRC] is false too as it does not foresee the future. needing to know who rapes is irrelevant, but the overall statistic is needed. We see once porn becomes legal, RAPE RATES DECREASE. \"the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85% in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults [7].\"\"An academic has claimed to RAW STORY that a decline in reported rape of 85% in the past 25 years can be tied to an increase in pornography consumption. \" [8]\"When compared to Disaster Center\\'s figures for forcible rape for the years 1980 and 2000, the four states with the lowest Internet access showed a 53% aggregate per capita increase in rape, while the four states with the highest Internet access showed a 27% decrease in incidence of rape.\"[8]Point proven.--economics--My opponents argument it will be spent elsewhere. That\\'s not how an economy works, you take away an industry the economy collapses. Extend argument. --First amendment-- First, we can only deprive this right if it infringes life liberty or pursuit of happiness. It actually increases all 3. Also the only time they can regulate speech is commerce, if they feel a compelling interest in nuetral speech, or regulation based on the way the message is sent. [9] the argument only works if it hurts people, it does not.My opponent then asks why does the government tax us. This shows little understanding of law. If the state has an interest to do something, as long as its compelling, they are allowed to do anything. There is no interest to break the 1t amendment for porn. My opponent then says it protects speech, not porn. Porn is an expression, 1st amendment protects expression, [10] it is unconstitutional to ban it. My opponents last argument is it is obscene, does it infringe life liberty or pursuit of happiness? No. No effect on life. Increases liberty, freedom of choice. And no effect on happiness, if it is ugly dont watch it. It is protected by the first amendment. Conclusion: 1. pro has not met the BOP2. Porns benefits outweigh the false negatives presented by pro3. VOTE PROarguments - con, BOP not met by pro, and I refuted her argumentseverything else tied or you choose.I enjoyed this debate, literally our of room.http://tinyurl.com...', 'Dear Rose212, I am not talking only about America. I am talking about what is happening globally. And in my opinion, low test scores have nothing to do with how governments influence schools with their beliefs. Students still know things, even with the low test scores and the low literacy rates. And if you still believe that schools and government have no relationship between them, then why some researchers show that people with low literacy rate tend to believe easier what is said to them? so, they will believe what they are told without any second thoughts or doubts about what they have heard. About the wars section. Yes, indeed we have wars but each country tries to make its citizens believe that they werent responsible about it. And like i have previously said, Cypriots learn the cypriot side and Turskish people the turkish side without being sure if what they have just learned is true or not. They just believe it because its their country telling something and they learn it from primary education until highschool or until college! So, in order to keep the government up dont they do it from schools?', \"@Rose212 I dont disagree with you. However, dont you think that governments put students learn what they want them too? For example, in history books, each country shows what they want them to learn and believe. For example, Americans learn that america hasnt done any mistakes and dont know the whole story. Another example is with Cyprus. In their history books they learn that Turkish done horrible thing during the war of 74 and Turkish's in their history books show that they did the war just to keep peace and that the turkish people who were at the island were at risk so they came to save them. So what side is the correct one? no one really knows, except from the governments and those who signed different contracts during the war. So each government provides students with the information they want them to know. To sum up, i still believe that schools keep the government alive.\", 'Some people argue that schools are made up to create nations and to keep the governments alive. Has school played this role indeed? If so, how?', \"The government doesn't fund enough money into schools. School's completely throughout the United States deal with money loss and low literacy rate and low test scores. America hasn't had many mistakes? Then why do we have wars? Why are we owing billions of dollars? The turkish hasn't influenced the United States, why bring it up? The government is made up of politics and power, not schools.\", 'School\\'s don\\'t keep the government alive. Many students lack off in school, and don\\'t do his/her work. According to a study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Literacy, 32 million adults in the United States cannot read. That\\'s 14 percent of the population. 21 percent of adults in the U.S. read below a 5th grade level, and 19 percent of high school graduates can\\'t read. In the dictionary the definition for the word, \"government\" is; the governing body of a nation, state, or community. How do school\\'s keep the government alive?', \"In the context of the free will argument, I meant that those who put Jesus to death had free will. I wasn't referring to the individual dying, I meant those that cause the death. Although, I can see how what said could be misinterpreted. Just for the record. I accept your forfeit. Thanks for the debate. It was fun. I look forward to future debates as well.\", '\"I had no idea that sitting in my car after it stalls on the railroad tracks and letting the train hit me, in not suicide. I only wish the insurance company and the law agreed.\" Well, it\\'s not exactly that simple. The action of allowing the train to hit you in the vast majority of cases essentially takes the away the agency of the train driver. Let me explain further, the train driver often cannot stop in time to prevent the death of the individual. That\\'s why the individual in question would be committing suicide. He is taking advantage of the lack of control a train to end their own life. The only one with free will in the scenario is the individual, as any choice the driver makes will result in the death of person choosing to end their life. Pilate chose to have Jesus executed. Jesus did allow it, but the people who brought him to Pilate, Pilate who ordered the execution, and the people who put him on the cross all had their free will. They could have refused to go any further with the execution of Jesus. Would it have been futile? Yes. Would Jesus have been executed anyway? Definitely. However, those people still chose to end Jesus\\' life. You are the only one choosing to end your life in the train scenario. \"So if I pay you to kill me, it\\'s not my action but only yours?\" Legally, yes. \"I know we are talking about Christianity, but in other religions allowing yourself to be killed for a higher cause is supposed to be a Holy act, isn\\'t it?\" First, we aren\\'t talking about other religions so this is completely irrelevant. Second, even if we were, allowing yourself to be killed is not suicide. I await my opponents final response.', 'I will be arguing that Jesus did not commit suicide. Lets get the definition of suicide first. Suicide : the act or an instance of taking one\\'s own life voluntarily and intentionally Now that we know the definition. Lets discuss. 1. Jesus didn\\'t commit suicide by definition Jesus foresaw his death, yes. However, he did not take his own life. For example, in the hypothetical scenario where I am a cancer patient and I decide to shoot myself, that would be suicide. If I in a different example, had a friend shoot me instead, my friend\\'s actions would be considered homicide. Jesus essentially gave his permission to the Romans/Jewish leader to have him executed. However, he did not take his own life. His death was and still is considered death by crucifixion. 2. Suicide is a sin in the Christian Bible (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) [19] Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; [20] you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17 NIV) [16] Don\\'t you know that you yourselves are God\\'s temple and that God\\'s Spirit lives in you? [17] If anyone destroys God\\'s temple, God will destroy him; for God&\\'s temple is sacred, and you are that temple. I feel as though these verses make it clear that suicide, the act of one destroying their \"temple\" is considered a sin as demonstrated in Corinthians. Suicide is clearly a sin. If we assume that Jesus foresaw his death, then we must also assume (for the purposes of this debate) that Jesus was the Son of God. Now, the purpose of Jesus\\' death on the cross was the be a perfect, and sinless sacrifice for the world. So, since suicide is a sin and Jesus is sinless, Jesus could not have committed suicide. I await my opponents response.', \"Jesus had very free will. He very easily could have gotten out of Dodge and avoided his foreseen and predicted death. Whether it was a ticking bomb or a speeding train or a bunch of servants ordered by authorities under strict control He willingly sacrificed Himself for a cause. Certainly a good cause indeed, but a voluntary submission to be killed. I do agree that Jesus would never have committed suicide without a higher purpose. I'm convinced that Jesus committed martyrdom and not conventional suicide. You win the debate. You don't need to explain to me what a train is, it was my story. I look forward to future debates.----->Face-of-the-deep\", \"I had no idea that sitting in my car after it stalls on the railroad tracks and letting the train hit me, in not suicide. I only wish the insurance company and the law agreed. So if I pay you to kill me, it's not my action but only yours? I know we are talking about Christianity, but in other religions allowing yourself to be killed for a higher cause is supposed to be a Holy act, isn't it?\", 'He must have had intense de-ja-vu to foresee all of the predictions He made. If someone allows their self to be killed, like sitting on the railroad tracks, when they could get up and leave, are they in retrospect committing suicide?', \"Hello.

This is the resolution as proposed by my opponent: Resolved: The US Government should ban guns. My definition of ban is yet to be challenged by my opponent, and I will stand by it. “Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.)” I never specify if this is a total gun ban or not, I use the blanket term guns and I do not specify the type of firearms that would be targeted, and I do not state “all guns” I simply stated “guns.” It would be illogical to think that I would propose an idea such as that given the examples used by both me and my opponent not being complete bans. Australia targeted semi-automatic guns, Britain banned handguns, and other countries that my opponent has brought up have not banned all guns anyway. Thus, if my opponent is truly wanting to debate a full gun ban, then he has not proved legitimate harms from passing the resolution since we both used partial bans in our points. In which case, this debate has devolved into meaningless dribble on both sides. Next, the 2nd amendment is brought up. My opponent states that an English expert stated that the 2nd amendment is an individual one. However, as the said expert explains, the interpretation is purely linguistic and takes into account the exact meaning of the constitution. Next, he cites a YouTube video, under any evidence standard, YouTube videos do not provide information worthy of putting into a case. Remember, video on YouTube can easily be biased in favor of one’s ideology. Also, state constitutions are different based on whether a liberal or conservative majority is in government positions. In places like California, Iowa, and Maryland have no provisions even concerning guns, while certain states allow for the public to be protected from policy that aims to clean up crime (1). My opponent also claims that the newer precedents of the interpretation of the 2nd amendment are somehow more valid simply because they are newer. Remember, the fact that there is such debate over the 2nd amendment’s limits imply that there is grey area where the interpretation of the amendment is concerned. After all, the court has decided other amendments to be limited in some ways as well. For example, in Davis vs. Boheim, the court upheld that defamation of character had to be proved with 4 criteria, but still was a crime. The founding fathers could not have determined the influx of gun crime in the US and certainly would not know that superior gun technology would exist to the point that automatic and semi-automatic weapon fire would exist, given the weapon of choice in the past to be muskets and flint lock pistols. Next, he attempts to attack my point about the fact that over a million children live in a household where a weapon is readily available. He brings up child negligence laws, which he claims that since the laws designed to prevent children becoming injured or killed and are still not enforced, neither would my ban. First, he conflates two different issues that are not in relation with each-other. There is no child negligence law federally that prevents where parents store the weapon if they have children, meaning that there is nothing to conflate to begin with. Also, I have defined the word “ban” with this in mind and mentioned raising penalties, which would deter the number of people who would break this law. Rebuttal 2: Suicides My opponent basically concedes to my suicide point by saying it is someone’s right to do so, and furthers this by claiming suicide to be a victimless crime. This is not the case, many people are effected by the decision to ends one’s life, including family members, friends etc. Not only this, but saving any life is inherently a benefit to everyone, as we affirm the right that people own to life. If suicide is to be legal anyway, it should be administered by a doctor, thus preventing trauma from other family members and friends. Next, he claims that many criminals are scared off from other people owning weapons. He has yet to refute my Boston University example and simply scoffed when I showed the fact that the CDC is not able to show benefits of gun control. Also, regardless of what the executive branch’s opinion is in this matter, it should be mentioned that at the time, and possibly even now, the legislative branch, where actual law gets passed is split on the issue. Also, my opponent claims that the Australia model will not work in America due to different demographics and beliefs held between the two nations. However, the Australian party in charge of the legislative branch equivalent was conservative, many not favoring the NFA (3). My opponent seems to think that by enacting any gun ban, we would guarantee that public violence would spark. The fact that it did not in any other country, despite conservative notions and outrage, points in the opposite direction. My opponent states that Australia’s homicide rate did not lower, even though he never directly states why. I have offered stats to the contrary. His statistic claimed that other crimes not associated with guns increased. Yet, he has yet to link the ban with higher rates of other crime. Also, need I remind you that Australia had significantly lower crime rates as a result? I have already shown you the graph in last round and the fact that homicide and suicide were lowered significantly (4). Also, the fact that crime decrease in Australia despite many people owning guns means that we would still have a decrease in crime, and death as a result. My opponent mentions the fact that there is no protection from tyranny. This is despite the fact that I have not advocated for a total ban on guns, meaning that people can still own some types of firearms, just not certain ones such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Also, assuming that the people of another country come and try to kill us, we would still have superior military forces, technology, and ability. The likeliness of anyone attacking us is slim at best to begin with, and I can assure you that people who have not been trained in combat scenarios will not even put up a fight against other country’s military, making this point non-unique, because in the event that my opponent proposes, there is little likeliness of survival for any civilian. The next example my opponent uses is the fact that gun control can be used to oppress people, using the example of slaves being oppressed by these laws from revolting. This is a straw-man fallacy, since the debate is about the general welfare of the people, and the fact that it “was” used to suppress people does not mean that the moment we pass gun control, the entire government starts oppressing its citizens. Rebuttal 3: Economy Again, the economy can be fixed, but the lives of the people is priceless. Since my opponent makes no argument against the welfare of the people framework, his argument does not stand. May it also be known that the manufacturing of all goods are being outsourced as we speak, meaning that in a few years, this will not even matter as other countries or robots manufacture the guns. Conclusion With the lives of the people at stake, and the obvious coming to light, one must vote in the affirmation. Good luck to my opponent as we approach the end of the debate. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...)', 'Rebuttal 1: 2nd amendment The 2nd amendment does not guarantee the right to own weapons without restriction. The Cornell Legal Dictionary states the exact language of the 2nd amendment as such: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" (1) An individual does not have the right to own a firearm without restriction. In fact, a Supreme Court case has established that the 2nd amendment is fluid in interpretation. The case in question is the United States vs. Miller case in 1934 which dealt with the regulation of a sawed-off shotgun under the National Firearms Act of the 1930s and established the original intent of the 2nd amendment was to establish militias to counter oppression, and that since the sawed-off shotgun had any reasonable relationship with a well-regulated militia, the 2nd amendment did not protect it (1). While other precedents later established the contrary, the fact that the original intent of the 2nd amendment was considered to be for the purposes of a militia still continues. Not only this, but there have been gun bans before other precedents have been set. For instance, there have been Assault Weapons Bans and provisions in the early 1990s that was not struck down as constitutional. However, if you really want a look at how people interpret the 2nd amendment, we need to look at popular opinion. According to a poll conducted by YouGov and the Huffington Post, over 80% of people support not allowing people to purchase guns if they are on the terrorist watch list (2). This, in itself is a gun ban, which falls under the resolution regardless of the type of weapon, or person purchasing said weapon. Thus resolution states “a” gun ban, not a “total gun ban” in which all weapons are confiscated or outlawed. Thus, the second amendment does not apply in this debate. Remember, we are talking about the general welfare of the people, which affirming the right to life does, while the second amendment has only led to people protecting the right of those to shoot others, the right to life is universally upheld by everyone and is more ingrained into society than the 2nd amendment. My opponent also claims that the majority of the gun owners in the US do not actually commit crimes or fall victim to gun accidents. I would be inclined to agree were it not for my framework. My framework states that we only value the promotion of the general welfare, and not the scope of the people affected. Even if I can only prove that the number of accidental shootings decreased, or the crime decreased is minimal, I still win based on the fact that the general welfare of the people is better off. Rebuttal 2: Violent crime rate My opponent is mistaken significantly. Not only have I proven the fact that there has been a notable decrease in homicide and suicide with or without guns used by 1.4% per annum (3), but he cites a questionable statistic that misses the point. My opponent claims that the prevalence of other crimes increased, but has yet to link it to the gun ban. Since the link is never made, the entire statistic is meaningless. This is especially true since the author of the NCPA article was Howard Nemerov, someone unknown to the world of academic publishing and posts articles to the website freerepublic.com, leading me to believe that at best, this source is questionable. I will address the argument that the rate of crime returned to pre-ban rates with a graph modeling the actual decrease in crime. We can look toward the evidence compiled from New York Times for this, from a previously used statistic (4). Also, there have been no mass shootings thus far in Australia since the gun ban, saving precious lives. Next, my opponent brings up Kennesaw, Georgia’s law that mandates gun ownership which purportedly stopped the city from devolving into the “wild, wild, west.” This is likely to occur anyway given the demographics and population of the city. City-Data reports a population of under 50,000 people and an average income about $10,000 higher than the rest of the state (5). Compare this to the millions living in Houston, New York, San Diego, and Philadelphia (6). The cities that are more susceptible to gun violence are in places where there are plenty of people, and poverty. This is because people look toward crime as a means of escape and possibly funding if they are part of organized crime, and that there are more people to shoot at with a greater risk of conflict when people are in close proximity. Regardless, the Kennesaw example simply does not work, and is clearly not representative of all of America. My opponent then calls to action through the policy of allowing teachers, principals, and other school officials to carry weapons. There is a major problem with this argument, and that one is human error. The American Journal of Epidemiology finds significant correlations between owning a firearm and gun violence in the form of homicide and suicide (7). It is not apparent that a teacher, principal, or whatever school official would not just leave the weapon out in the open. I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon, which could mean access to said firearm and resulting in mass shootings as well as gun accidents (8). Ultimately, the gun ban proposal in Australia is shown to have worked by my evidence provided. Also, the counter-proposal to the gun ban could lead to more harm and more of a threat to the general welfare of the people. Rebuttal 3: Defense My opponent first states that guns are used to prevent tyrannical government takeovers, animals that would attack people, and criminals. Later, he cites a report claiming a significant deterrent between gun ownership and deterrence of crime. Live-Science reports that Boston University conducted a similar study and found evidence correlating higher homicide rates and gun ownership (9). Not only this, but I have already linked owning a weapon with the higher chance of ending up dead due to homicide or suicide as reported from the American Journal of Epidemiology (7). Not only this, but the study was conducted in 1995, during a federal weapons ban and higher incarceration rates. In other words, the times were different, and since the criminals were unaware of who had a gun due to said ban, the fear of a gun would be irrational. My opponent also brings up a poll of inmates which, in his own statistic, proves to be unreliable as the lead of the study restricted the sample size to those who had begun their sentences in 1979 or have been out of jail since then (10). It goes without saying that the fact that people were still scared of guns under my opponents estimate during the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that proves despite what restrictions we place on guns; people will still be frightened as they are not rational actors. Not only this, but lowered crime rates as shown by Australia would suggest less of a need to use guns as self-defense as opposed to a knife or any other weapon. The CDC report is not shocking in its results given the fact that, as reported by LA Times, the CDC for the past 20 years have been forbidden from advocating or spending money to promote gun control meaning that the research had to be stopped, despite its truth or fallacious value (11). This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently. In other words, my offensive arguments hold water in today’s debate, meaning an affirmative vote is necessary. Rebuttal 4: Economy First, there are other industries where manufacturing other goods besides guns can occur. Also, given the lives lost by not affirming this resolution, this impact is not as important. I even state in my framework that the economy can be fixed, but once a life is lost, it can’t be brought back. Rebuttal 5: Violence would ensue I never argued for a total gun ban, as this was not part of the resolution. I have only addressed Australia’s model, which was not a complete ban either. I have already shown you that there is support for a ban on firearms sold to those on the terrorist watch list, which would be a gun ban as well, with over 80% of people in favor of the idea (2). In other words, there is no guaranteed violent crime outbreak from NRA supporters. There would be outrage by some, as shown by the fact that conservative officials were in charge of the NFA in Australia, but the saving of people is a bipartisan issue, and I am certain people will see it that way, just like people did after the NFA was passed. Conclusion My burden in this debate is to prove that a gun ban would be beneficial to the people’s general welfare, as stated in the framework of the debate which my opponent has yet to challenge. Thus, this is a victory for the affirmation. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...) 5. (http://tinyurl.com...) 6.

Also, it is imperative that definitions account for the specific language in the resolution. Ban: Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.) Guns: Firearms. Framework We need weigh the impact of the general welfare of the people in today’s debate higher than any other impact. This is due to the fact that lives are priceless and the prevailing theories about debates such as this is that the number of people who are harmed by guns are a much bigger problem than the economy, which can always be fixed. Thus, if I can prove that the gun ban promotes the general welfare of the people, then the judges should feel comfortable to vote in my favor, and vice-versa for my opponent. Contention 1: Gun bans have been successful in reducing gun violence There is significant evidence pointing toward national gun bans to be the best way to reduce gun violence and crime. To see this, we turn toward Australia, the nation that has single-handedly decimated the gun violence in their own nation. This was accomplished by passing the National Firearms Agreement of 1996 as a reaction to the brutal massacre at a Tasmanian Seaside Resort (1). Harvard in 2007 reported that the result was that within 7 years of the installment of the sweeping policy that outlawed the majority of firearms and raised penalties for owning said weapons, the firearm suicide rate was cut in half from over 2/100,000 to 1.1/100,000 (1). This created a major dip in the total suicide rate not relating to firearms, as shown by the Guardian in June of 2016 when it states that the 1996 reforms resulted in the rising rate of suicides non-firearm suicides and homicides from 2.1% a year to 1.4% decline, which researchers attribute to the fact that people were not looking toward other methods of suicide or homicide (2). As previously mentioned, the rate of homicides also decreased significantly after the reforms were passed. The New York Times reports that despite the growing population of Australia, and the conservative nature of the government, these reforms did pass and resulted in the homicide rate decreasing by 50% in the decade after installment and has been on the decline since (3). Again, the rate of total homicide was shown to decrease as well, as criminals did not switch to another weapon to commit the crime they would have intended to have done (3). This can be attributed to the fact that guns are the most available type of weapon with a significant chance to inflict mortal damage. A knife is unwieldy and does not result in the same mortality rate as guns. The Annals of Emergency Medicine Journal in a 2003 report examined 4,122 patients and found that of those who were shot, 1/3 of them died, while only 7.7% died from knife wounds (4). It is harder to approach someone and aim for a vital organ without the victim knowing than it is to simply aim for a vital organ of said victim with a weapon. Given the fact that the majority of the guns used in homicides today are handguns, (as compiled from FBI data,) we can most definitely see that weapons which are small and fit in one’s hand are hard to see from the perspective of an unsuspecting victim (5). By decreasing the murder rate, we establish more peace in cities and suburbs that were fraught with gun violence beforehand, thus protecting the safety of the people and promoting the general welfare. We provide a safe environment for people to live in which ultimately means we protect their right to life without due process, as the taking of a life is in violation of this, which is again, promoting the general welfare of the people. Thus, one must cast a vote in the affirmation. Contention 2: Prevent gun accidents from occurring as well as lapses in judgement Gun accidents are prevalent in the status quo, much to the ire of many people. What is more disturbing is who fall victim in these gun accidents. Slate magazine quoted David Hemmingway in his book Private Guns, Public Health of the University of Michigan Press in 2006 which states that children are nine times more likely to die by gun accident in the US than any other nation in the developed world (6). These are preventable circumstances and should never occur as the children are our future educators, lawyers, and basically our entire job force. Despite the fact that there are training methods for children to prevent accidents like these from occurring, there is significant evidence to the contrary. Hardy MS of the Eckerd College in St. Petersburg FL in a report showed that out of 34 children aged 4-7, even after given the safety program, over 50% of them actually played with a firearm when given an opportunity to do so (7). With over 1 million children living in a household where a firearm is unlocked and not put away, or loaded according to the International Business Times in January of 2016, we can see that the current gun culture has ruined many people’s lives (8). However, this brings us to the question, of whether there is a safe way to store a firearm. The answer is a resounding no. The American Journal of Epidemiology found correlations between owning a firearm and increased chance of homicide, and suicide. Specifically speaking, nearly ¾ of suicide victims lived in a household with a gun, which is the same for 42% of homicide victims (9). What is more disturbing is the fact that a huge portion of the homicides were attributed to family disagreements, making up over 30% of homicides (9). People are simply not rational to be able to be under the stress of society, their job, their family, and their own hopes to own a weapon and assume that they will use it correctly. This is especially true if we look at American Medical News which reports in 2010 that there are about 15 million adults with depression in a given year, many of whom will not receive treatment (10). In fact, a 201 Live-science article reports that half of the depressed population does not get the treatment they need (11). This certainly has a correlation with the suicide rate and shows that Americans simply cannot own weapons in the way we want to in the status quo with millions of guns in circulation. In other words, we prevent the people who need psychological help from committing suicide while providing for the welfare of children and guaranteeing that the American people are not as likely to die from their own weapons. Thus, I am upholding the framework which states that we care about the people that will be effected by the resolution, ultimately leading to an obvious vote in the affirmation. Contention 3: Upholding life It is the sworn duty of the government to uphold the and protect the rights of the people so they do not become slaves to an oppressive and abusive government. By affirming, we do this because we set a precedent for upholding the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as outlined by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence (12). These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, and that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they are represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, and the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law and has the right to life, liberty, and property. These ideas are based on the philosophy of John Locke, an enlightenment figure who inspired the creation of our government (13). This leads us to realize that by not holding up the job of the government, we are suppressing the people’s rights by allowing copious gun violence to continue and thus violating their autonomous right to life without due process of law. In this way, the US has an obligation to fix this problem posthaste and stop the violation of rights in the US, thus promoting the general welfare by giving people what they were promised by the political documents that established our country. Conclusion We need to affirm the resolution and save lives that would be lost without our ability to counter the threat. By doing so we prevent homicides, suicides, accidents, lapses of judgement, and to protect the rights of the American people from further encroachment. I have shown that under the affirmative world, the general welfare is upheld and thus, fulfilling my burden of proof, thank you. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3.

Freedom & Law The confiscation, outlawing, & penalization of the ownership of guns. That is what your definition presented means. That means confiscating people of their weapons, making it illegal to own one, & if anyone that slipped through the cracks & caught later then they will be charged with a crime. The resolution is the US should ban guns, not the US government should ban certain people of having guns. As you also stated in your previous round \"the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away,\" The 2nd amendment is an individual right, an expert on the English language [1] [2] [3] as well as a much newer Supreme Court cases states it to be the case. [4] [5] State constitutions calling it as such. [6] The meaning come even more clear when you also look at the intent of the Founders. Essentially an overturned court case hold no importance at all. Even if it did, assault weapons most definitely would fall under such arguments and therefore shouldn\\'t result in banning them. However this argument regards all guns. \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" \" Samuel Adams. [7] In order for the government to deny everyone\\'s right to bear arms, they can\\'t make the case of the \\'greater good of the general welfare\\', they must make the case for each individual has committed a crime grave enough to warrant that person\\'s right be restricted for the \\'greater good\\', cause due process. This can\\'t be done for 99.99% majority hasn\\'t committed a crime \"I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon,\" I\\'ve already brought up laws already established that penalizes negligence & child endangerment, if that law can\\'t be enforced with only 2 million guilty. There is no way humanly possible to enforce a law on 100-150 million people whom are against such a thing and has already act in defiance of such things. Estimated crime with the use of a gun is at 500,000, the number of cases in defense of a crime is considerably more. Since there already laws established under due process to restrict people convicted of a crime grave enough to warrant a restriction. There are not among the debate like the 10s of millions innocent who are accident, homicide, or suicide free, that would be affected by the definition presented. A person convicted of a crime results in their rights be restricted, not everyone\\'s right. That is due process So again from the aspect of freedom & legality, this argument is done. Suicides Suicide is a victim less \\'crime\\', ultimately the peoples\\' right to do so. A person has a right to their own, hence their right to end it if they wish. Therefore, the act of voluntarily taking ones own life as a reason to remove the vast majority of the peoples\\' right to defend theirs should be dropped & ignored. In my last round I showed that a large % of criminals was scared off before completion of a crime & even prevented a crime from taking place. This mindset for anyone that values their self preservation will exist anywhere in the world, including Australia. After the gun ban in Australia, more people became victims cause they, the criminals, were emboldened, less afraid of their life being taken. From pro\\'s source \"It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States.\" Why? Cause the American people in vast numbers refuse to follow suit with such things as buybacks & registering. The mindset of Australians & Americans are different. There is historic evidence that Americans won\\'t rid themselves the right to bear arms cause a fraction of 1% of the population use their gun illegally & irresponsibly. You think the defiance would cease in the face of forced confiscation? That\\'s wishful thinking. \"This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently.\" Wild assertion, if that was the case, the US government, whom is actively bent on gun control, wouldn\\'t have funded it. My opponents attempt to rebut the facts that despite predictions of Kennesaw becoming a war zone after the law passed didn\\'t come to light. Crime rates reduced across the board after the law was passed, just as crime rates increased in other parts of the the US & world following bans including Australia. The only difference in crime rates before and after the ban in Australia, UK, Jamaica, ext was the ban, [8] so logic dictates that gun ownership is a major factor in the crime rates. Mexico, strict gun control is in a major war with their armed citizens whom are possession of them. [8] The United Kingdom, strict gun laws, regarded my dangerous nation in Europe, worse then the United States. [8] Gun ownership is considered an important crime deterrent. The police force in the United States doesn\\'t prevent crime, they just catch the criminals that commit the crime. Officers arrive after the fact, people must be able to protect themselves when those seconds matter then report the crime afterwards. There are 100s 1000s of animal attacks a year, millions of criminals committing crimes,without a gun every year, government abuse, I\\'ve seen in person, and increase risk of invasion. America\\'s superpower status is waning, China status of becoming a thing, as well as Russia. Tensions rising in world, America\\'s natural defenses of distance and geographic position is null in modern times. It may not happen within the nest 50 years but America wasn\\'t always the most powerful & its not logical to assume that we will away be most powerful. The right to bear arms was also established so that a foreign nation can\\'t invade & subject us to the types of harshness that the Nazis placed on those lands they occupied as well as against their own people. Or Japan\\'s Nanking Rape where national armies abandon the city leaving the people there with no means of defense. America is not immune to tyranny or invasion, the British ruled, they were pushed out but slavery existed, then gun control measures existed to prevent blacks from rising up and dealing with this tyranny. [9] The economic toll on America & whole states would be negatively affected. 300,000+ people would take a hit which can itself result in a desperate act of criminal activity. The voters need to place the affects of banning or not banning on a set of scales. This isn\\'t just a save lives measure cause there are aspects of American life that will be affected. Therefore any legit discussion involves all that would be involved. The people positively affected of gun ownership & people affected negatively. Looking at the facts, you\\'ll see that the positively affected outweighs the negative. The rights of 318 million Americans would be violated, cause of 500,000-1 million whom abuse their right. The former outweighs this here. Gun ownership is undeniably a crime deterrent, criminals will be criminals, removing the innocence ability to use the most efficient means of defense will result in increase crime. This will not protect the \\'general welfare\\' of the people. The economic toll on the US economy that is already $19 trillion in debt would severely hurt our ability to get out of debt faster, our already unemployment problem would get much worse. And peoples\\' ability to provide for their loved ones being negatively affected would result in desperate measure, not in the best interest of the United States or the general welfare of the people. The consequence of a government program to forcibly confiscate weapons from Americans would result in a vast defiance from the people. People would refuse to surrender their arms, as their historic counterparts had done in the past, & any attempt to put the people & the government into at odd in such a situation would, highly likely, result in the death of Americans both citizen & law enforcement in government. This is again, not in the best interest of the US government or the general welfare. [1] http://articles.latimes.com... [2] http://www.constitution.org... [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org...

[10] [11]', 'Freedom \"These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, & that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they\\'re represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, & the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law & has the right to life, liberty, & property. \" That is essentially my argument based on the rights of the people. Americans have a right to life, liberty, & property + pursuit of happiness. The government is constructed & its purpose is to protect those rights, among them, the 2nd amendment. Americans have a right to use their property, in this case guns, to protect their life, liberties, property, & pursuit of happiness. It is estimated that 1/3 to even 1/2 of the population own guns, that is 100-150 million people. [1] There is around 33,600 deaths by guns annually, includes accident, negligent, murder, & suicides. [2] That means that .0003% of the population did something resulting in a life taken, that also means that 99.9997% was accident free, no suicide or homicides. Legally, the other 99-149 million+ gun owners shall be free & the government has 0 reason to attempt to deny them of that right based on due process. Cause they have not committed a crime to warrant an arrest, placed on trail, & certainly not found guilty of trail by a jury of their peers. Furthermore, 90% of the people oppose a complete ban and confiscation. [3] So, from a legal & a freedom aspect, there should not be a gun ban. Gun bans don\\'t work Comparing pre & post gun ban crime rates for the UK, Ireland, Jamaica, & Australia, it tells you that the murder rates increased or was similar to pre gun ban. [4] [5] However, other crimes did indeed increase, the UK is considered the most dangerous nation in Europe, worse than the US & South Africa. [6] However, there is a law in Kennesaw GA, that requires heads of households to own a gun & crime rates have decreased, resulting in a murder free environment for 25 years, despite predictions that that American county would become the wild west. [7] Whereas, other counties enacting opposite laws have seen increases in crime rates. [8] Lets look at the most painfully obvious proof that gun ban doesn\\'t work... At our schools. The law abiding Americans accept this obviously proven mistake at great cost to, as you said, America\\'s future. Instead of allowing responsible people, I\\'m sure we agree that most teachers are responsible, whom owns a firearm to conceal carry, or the principle, or someone there to have access to their gun to defend the school against a potential intruders. Defense There are a multitude of potential threats the American people face. Animal attacks in the 100s of 1000s for just dogs [9], criminals, invasion, & tyrannical government. These threats are real, a ban & confiscation of firearms would result in much larger number of potential fatalities against animals, criminals would be embolden by their victims reduced chances, invasion of the United States could forget about strategic planning for the stiff resistance of the American people thanks to a ban, & the people would be forced to live under a government that controls the monopoly of force which is a very dangerous gamble to take. A famous quote comes to mind when I write this, \"Those that give up liberty for temporary safety will lose both & deserve neither\" Now for a comparison between legal defense gun uses vs illegal gun uses in crime. \" A 1995 study in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology based upon a 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone \"almost certainly would have been killed\" if they \"had not used a gun for protection.\" Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 162,000 such incidents per year. This figure excludes all \"military service, police work, or work as a security guard. \" [10] The estimated number of times guns are used in defense against a criminal range in the low 100,000-millions. Report from the CDC puts the number of times Americans used a gun to frighten an intruder away at about 500,000. [10] The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology estimates that the number of times guns are used in defense is over 1 million. [10] A 1982 survey of felons in prison concluded that 34% was scared off from a gun owner, 40% didn\\'t commit a crime out of a belief that the victim was in possession of gun, & 69% of them knew someone else that were scared off with a gun. [10] The lowest estimates of occasions that Americans use guns in defense is multiple times higher than they are used to murder. Average estimates are about the same number of times guns are used illegally, high estimates rivals or surpasses violent crimes. The CDC also concluded that gun ownership is an important crime deterrent. [11] Bad for the economy A ban on guns would result in a serious problem for the economy, there are over 155,000 workers that are good paying jobs in that industry. Even more workers that revolves around that industry. Those businesses provide near $7 billion in taxes, & near $50 billion to the economy. A ban would cause those people their jobs, assuming they have a families it easily affects 310,000 people not counting real possibility that they have children. [12] Entire states are dependent on the gun industries, the gun industry employs more people then GM. [13] To put it in a little perspective, America\\'s gun industries, if they were a nation, would rank around 82nd wealthiest nation in the world, there are 173 nations. [14] So the gun industry provides America with more money than half of the world\\'s nations can provide itself. Violence would ensue The American reaction towards a call of confiscation would be negative to say the least. As I said earlier in this round, 90% of Americans oppose a total gun ban & any attempt to confiscate them. A large % of Americans refuse to register their weapons. [15] [16] The last time authorities went on a hell bent mission of gun confiscation resulted in the \\'shot hear round the world\\' [17], I don\\'t imagine the reactions of freedom loving people in the United States would respond much differently. The people of the United States having been born & raised understanding that the 2nd amendment is the ultimate line of defense against tyranny, & knowing that when seconds truly matter, cops are minutes away. Americans will not quietly surrender what is considered the most important right the American people have. [1] http://bearingarms.com... [2] http://www.cdc.gov...

Naawwww. If you want to accept, let me know.', 'Thank you for accepting. As a reminder, please do not read this argument until round 2 is over. The positive effects of Christianity are listed below: Christianity is an advocate of human rights. In the Roman empire, infanticide was common, and it was legal to kill a child. [1] Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, was the one to finally outlaw it. [2] Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery. According to historian Glenn Sunshine, \"Christians were the first people in history to oppose slavery systematically. Early Christians purchased slaves in the markets simply to set them free.\" [3] In addition, two thirds of the American abolition society in 1835 were Christian ministers. [4] Martin Luther King Jr. was also a Christian minister, and he is a great example of a human rights supporter. [5] Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates. Christianity has been a leader in education because Bible literacy was so important to Christians. The first law to require education of citizens was passed by American Puritans in Massachusetts. [6] All but one of the first 123 American colleges were Christian institutions. The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible. The idea that all men are created equal is a biblical doctrine. [8] The notion of God\\'s authority is part of the Declaration of Independence and all 50 state constitutions. The preamble of the declaration states, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights...\". Christianity helped to make advancements in science. Many of the founders of modern science were Christians, such as Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, and Louis Pasteur.

When you say \"One nation, under God\" you are not expressing your faith; you are recognizing the Christian origins of the United States. If God does not exist, then the nation was still created under the idea of God. Abraham Lincoln was an atheist. [2] False Hope Using the hashtag #PrayforParis does not create false hope. It makes the people feel better by showing that you care for them. In a situation like that there isn\\'t anything else you can do. Misunderstandings I see even more midunderstandings. Even though you were Catholic, you apparently were ignorant of your religion. 1. The Bible is not what God says. It was not written by God, nor did God teach all of its content. [3] 2. Christianity teaches that if you sin and don\\'t repent, you go to hell, not just if you sin. 3. Thinking that someone is in hell is not false hope, or any hope for that matter. 4. The Old Testament is not considered to be infallible by Christianity. You have contradicted that statement but you have not disproved it. 5. I am not prejudiced against those who are not Christians.

The arguments you claim that I did not respond to All the effects are either one of the arguments I already responded to or something like abortion where the argument only works if you can prove that abortion is not bad.

Literacy/Science I already negated your argument about the dark ages. Declaration/Constitution I also negated that argument. Human Rights I can see a lot of misunderstandings on your part. I will list corrections to them below: 1. The Bible does not have to state that something is wrong in order for Christianity to teach that it is wrong. The Bible is not the \"book of rules\" for Christianity. Christians use the teaching of Jesus to determine what is right or wrong. [1] 2. People are not condemned to hell for sinning. People are condemned to hell for knowing and hating God. Many Christians even believe in Empty Hell Theory. [2] 3. The Old Testament is not considered to be infallible by Christianity. It contains Jewish teachings; Christians only use it as a source for the history of the Israelites, prophecies, Psalms, and some stories with good morals. The books of Exodus and Hosea are not Christian doctrine and are not entirely relevant to Christian beliefs. [3] 4. Two thirds is a lot. Most Americans in 1835 were not Christian ministers, so if most of an organization consists of Christian ministers, Christianity very likely has something to do with it. 5. I never said nor implied that Christianity automatically makes someone a good person, or that a non-Christian can\\'t be good; I actually said that Christianity makes someone more likely to be a good person. 6.

The Middle Ages produced classic literature such as \"Beowolf\" and \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", great architecture such as the many castles and cathedrals, and art such as stained glass windows that rival modern art. The Renaissance depended on the science and philosophy of what was apparently \"the dark ages\". Modern philosophy is built upon the work of medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, who was a devout Catholic monk educated at a Catholic university. In fact, the first universities were created by Catholics who valued education. Historians have even found that \"the Renaissance\" was improperly named; there were in fact three other ones on the Middle Ages. [1] I\\'m not even going to respond to that inaccurate picture you linked from a highly biased, unreliable, random blog. Wars As you have said, many Christians have gotten themselves killed for their faith. That is a lot like soldiers dying for our country. Our country has problems, many of its people die unnecessarily, but it is still a good thing. I and many other people are proud to be American despite the country\\'s corrupt laws and politicians, because it is still a young country and it is still trying to help people. The same could be said of Christianity. It has done bad, but it is trying to do good. That was an interesting link you posted. Let me respond to each part separately. Ancient Pagans Before you say that Christians are bad for killing pagans, first consider what the pagans did. They burned children alive as sacrifice, they allowed slaves to be mistreated, they dehumanized women and made them slaves of their husbands, they raped children, they killed Christians (that was probably their main motivation for killing pagans), and many other things. Being a pagan was rightfully seen as equivalent to being a murderer, a rapist, and a slave trader. [2] Mission Since you only showed two examples here, that shows how rare Christian corruption is. Remember what I said about wars. Crusades This was a war, so of course people died, and Christianity is not to blame. Muslims were oppressing Christians, and the Crusaders rescued them. [3] Atheists and Heretics All the examples here are a few corrupt Christians (although they were not really Christians) going against their religion. Witches This had nothing to do with Christianity. Religious Wars This is yet again Christians protecting Christianity from those who wish to harm it. Jews When Jews were harmed, it was either an unfortunate side effect of a war, a response to Jewish aggression, or a few corrupt bishops acting against their religion. Native peoples All the examples here are used as part of a huge cherry-picking fallacy. Many people believed that Native Americans were violent savages because many of them were, and stereotypes formed because of that. However, he is ignoring the Quakers who made peace with them and bought their land at a fair price, the Catholic missionaries who set up shelters and schools for the natives, and the French (most of them Christians) who traded with them and treated them equally with themselves. Extermination camps This had nothing to do with Christians. The so-called Christians who did this broke nearly all ten commandments in the process. This is also another cherry-picking fallacy; he ignores Maximillian Kolbe, a Catholic priest who was arrested for sheltering Jews and later volunteered to starve to death in place of a Jewish man (the Jewish man survived the camp). He also ignores the fact that Hitler discouraged going to church, and had many Christians killed for opposing him. I could go on and on things like this if I only had the time. Now I will respond to your last arguments: Judgment I am shocked by your ignorance on the subject. Muslims believe in God and we have had an atheist president (Abraham Lincoln). I will ignore everything you say here until you confirm your assumptions. False hope Christians do not think that God will do everything for them. They simply ask for help. Conclusion So far, you have found one negative effect of Christianity (radicals), while I have found four. [1] http://www.independent.co.uk... http://listverse.com...

Since christianity was their motive, that means Christianity is the reason they committed the killing, therefore making it an effect. Witches: People were hung by the judges of the court (who were christians) because witchcraft was seen as an act of the devil. Therefore, Christianity caused the hanging of all those who died in the Salem witch trials. Misunderstandings: Just because you personally know more good christians than atheists, does not mean that's a solid case. You are playing to stereotypes. If someone killed someone you love, would you not hope for them to be punished for it? Sure prison for life and the death penalty would be punishment, but I know a lot of people would want them to burn in hell. But you're saying if they got repent, they'll get a clean slate? That's an injustice in my eyes. The fact they will get to go to heaven after the horrible deed they committed just because they repented, seems very wrong to me. Also, the bible does have God teachings and Gods words in it, written by people who have dealt with God. However, saying God didn't teach all of its content is completely ignorant. False Hope: It is creating False Hope. Their is things we can do, such as donate money, provide help(resources,protection, ect.) to Paris, ect. You never argued against the offering once in any of your arguments. If you did, then I have overlooked it and I apologize, but I have yet to see where you have argued it. It is now up to the voters to decide who made the better case. Good job Pro, and thanks for the intriguing debate.\", 'Thanks for the intriguing argument. I\\'m going to rebut your arguments from Round 3 and 4, so please bear with me if I\\'m jumping from an argument you said one round to one in another. In your argument, you stuck up for the christians actions of war. The killing of people is by no means a positive, and you defending and saying it is dumbfounds me. The lost of any life, no matter the cause or reasoning, is a negative. You also said Christianity had nothing to do with witches. That is a false statement, as you can look at examples such as the infamous Salem Witch Trials. As for my Judgement argument, I shouldn\\'t have said Muslim, but you know what my notion was. Who would you feel to have to stand up every morning and praise something you don\\'t believe in? If that part is what you ask for confirmation, their truly is no need. You should be able to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue. Other than that, I see no other part of that argument that needs confirmation. As far as Abraham Lincoln benign atheist, their is no solid ground for that as many aren\\'t certain what he was. Until you give 100% proof he was atheist, your claim doesn\\'t stand, and mine does. In the false hope argument I stated that not all christians rely on God, but many do. They ask for help, but some rely to the point where they hope for a \"miracle\". I\\'m going to use the Paris attacks to help explain my case. What happened to Paris is completely inhuman. Many people from all around the world have showed their support. A trending hashtag for the last few days has been #PrayforParis. However, when people say this, what are they truly doing? Saying I\\'m praying for you is practically the same as saying I hope everything works out. You are not truly doing anything. By saying you are praying for them, you are relying on God to answer your prayer and to help the people of Paris. But unless you(or anyone else) don\\'t do anything, it won\\'t help them, therefore you have created a false hope. As far as me having misunderstandings, I\\'m afraid I have to disagree. I was a catholic for 16 years, and I thought I had a pretty good understanding of christianity. From what I\\'ve learned, the bible is how we are suppose to live our lives off. It\\'s teaches us about our creator and what he says, and I figured we should live off what he says. As far as not going to hell for sinning, I\\'m almost positive you do. By saying you don\\'t go to hell for sinning, that\\'s saying serial killers go to heaven with their victims. That\\'s ludicrous. Murder is a sin, and if you\\'re saying they don\\'t go to hell for committing sins(no matter how big or small), then what\\'s the point of having it? This would also add to my false hope argument, making the victims Families think the murdered will spend eternity in the depths of hell when actually they get to spend eternity with God. As far as the Old Testament being infallible: If a man murders a family, but is now a \"changed\" man(church going, compassionate, giving, charitable), he\\'s still a murderer. Even though he has changed, the murder and his past stay with him. Therefore, things from the Old Testament christians are trying to forget about are still with their religion. Saying that \"christianity makes someone more likely to be a good person\" is completely prejudice. Just because someone isn\\'t a christian doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t be a good person. By what you said, you\\'re saying atheist and other religions consists of not so good people. Considering you\\'re a christian, then I\\'m going to assume you got your views because of your biased belief, meaning christianity has given you prejudice beliefs, which is a negative. Once again, just because a person is christian and does something good, doesn\\'t mean you can give a positive to christianity, I stated several people who were successful who were atheists. Isaac Newton could have been an atheist and still made the discoveries he made, his religion had no affect in it. In addition, there is 45 more negatives on the site I listed below of my arguments that you completely ignored. Therefore, I would have presented more than one negative claim like you previously stated. http://www.patheos.com... In counting, I have presented atleast 43 negative arguments(I have presented more, but you have rebutted them and it is up to the voters to see if they think it\\'s a negative or not) as you agreed the offerings caused hardship to families, hurt scientific growth, and takes away from others, and then the 40 negatives on the site. Good luck to Pro in his concluding round. http://www.patheos.com...', 'I will rebuttal those claims in the next round, and rebuttal your arguments from the second round this round. Here are my rebuttals to arguments posted by pro in the second round: *Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates and *Christianity helped to make advancements in science Both of these claims are false. The time christianity ushered in greatness and superiority was the Dark ages, where we actually went backwards in advancement and became illiterate. As far as the scientists, their religious beliefs play no affect in their contributions to science, as it would not matter if they were atheist or a different religion. *The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible This just proves my point of how the United States is favoring Christianity and breaking people\\'s first amendment right AND the separation of church and state. *Christianity is an advocate of human rights In your very own words you stated that, \"Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery\" In the Bible, the most prestigious book in a christians view, talks about owning a slave. If slavery was wrong, the bible would say it is wrong and anyone who did it was condemned to hell. However, it does not, and actually informs us what to do with the slave. Therefore, it does not think slavery is bad, and actually guides us to be better slave owners. Now it is possible some christians set them free, but if they were truly devote christians they would follow what the bible says, and the bible says, Exodus 21:20-21 \"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money [property]. \" You went on to say how 2/3 of the American Abolition society were Christian ministers. What about the other 1/3 then? Just because you are christian doesn\\'t mean you are automatically a great person. An atheist, Muslim, Jew, Buddist, ect, can be as good and even a better person as a Christian. You also talk about infanticide, and how the Christian Roman emperor finally outlawed it. In the Bible, God talks about slaughtering children. \"The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open. \"(Hosea 13:16) You can find more verses, like God ordering moses to slaughter babies, at this site . http://www.patheos.com... agree.

This time was called the Dark Ages\" -Richard Lederer The Dark Ages referred to the period of time ushered in by the fall of the Western Roman Empire. This took place when the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by Odoacer, a barbarian. AD 476 was the time of this event. This era takes on the term \"dark\" due to the backward ways and practices that seemed to prevail during this time. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Men and women sought after God; some through the staid rituals of the Catholic Church. Intellectuals view religion in any form as, itself, a type of \"darkness.\" These thinkers assert that those who followed religious beliefs lied to themselves, creating a false reality. They were dominated by emotions, not fact. Religion was seen as contrary to rationality and reason, thus the move towards enlightenment -- a move away from \"darkness.\" Science and reason gained ascendancy, progressing steadily during and after the Reformation and Age of Enlightenment. As you can see above, religion hindered are progression in science,literature,math, and other subjects that if we avoided this we could be extremely more advanced than we are today. This link goes to a picture showing the drop in technology during the Dark ages http://3.bp.blogspot.com... 2.Wars While many believe Christianity promoted peace, it actually has brought great damage. Not only has it affected it\\'s followers, with believers and even his disciples being crucified, burned, ect. for believing in Christianity, and even today with 100 millions christians being prosecuted for their faith. It has also impacted other people, as it has brought wars and slaughterings. Tons of examples can be found at this site http://articles.exchristian.net... Also, at this site, http://addictivelists.com... it list 10 biggest religious wars ever fought, and Christianity and its denominations(catholic) are involved with around 5 of them. 3.The offering At church(Atleast for Catholic Churches) they go around asking for offerings(money donations). The church wants you to give 10% of your works pay that week towards the church. Some people aren\\'t wealthy enough to just give 10%, but some will do it anyways. This could lead to a financial burden to the family/individual. Also, the donations do not count as tax deductions, so no benefits go to the donator in that sense. Think about the money donated. If all of that money was donated to a charity how many lives it would impact. Think about if it was given to St.Judes or another organization similar to that, how many lives it would save and help further medicine. Church taking the offering is putting a burden on struggling families and the growth of medicine/well being of others. 4.Judgement Let me ask you, what is the ... Amendment? It\\'s the Freedom of Religion. However, it is no secret we support Christianity. With 77% of our citizens being Christians, it is the most dominant religion by a extravagant margin. Because of this, our nation has put christianity and made it part of our society and government, breaking our amendment and the separation of church and state. They put in our currency and in our Pledge of Alligence. Tell me, how would you feel being a Muslim having to say \"One nation, under God...\"? You would feel like a minority. With everything around you, including your government, supporting a religion, you almost feel obligated and self conscious about your own personal belief, and feeling as if you need to change. This is violating a persons belief and amendment. Also, another demonstration on how Christianity runs our government is how no atheist have been President of the United States. On this poll http://www.gallup.com... it shows how people will less likely vote for an atheist than any other option. An atheist, no matter how good a politician, is less likely get elected, taking away their job opportunities. Christianity is making the land of the free every judgmental. 5.False hope For many, christianity is hope. It\\'s assurance that no matter how tough the times are, things will get better. Yet the harsh reality is, it\\'s uncertain there is a God. And if there is no good, then chances of your situation getting better become more slim. Take, for example, a man who just lost his job. He prays for everything to get better, and for God to help him. He is hopeful as his omnipotent omnibenevolent God will surely help him, yet he is devastated as loses his house. His hope turned into false hope, which led to no hope. For some, they rely too much on this hope, and won\\'t do anything as they feel God will do it for them. Along with that, I found a site listing 40 harmful effects of Christianity http://www.patheos.com... So in total, that is 45 negatives to Christianity.

The presence of a gun can turn a petty or small situation into a lethal one When a teacher needs to diffuse a uncontrollable situation they have to call the school police officer.

The school is a gun-free zone for a reason. http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com... (This source is linked to police shootings but can easily be applied to any situation) 2. Intimidation Students may feel intimidated or threatned with the very notion of a gun near them. I am a high school student myself and lockdown drills (Drills where a shooter is in the school) make some kids very scared, one even passed out. Now make that a gun in the classroom and you will see my point. Not only this but this will make teacher to student interactions a lot more tense. http://www.huffingtonpost.com... 3. Talking can be a greater weapon than a gun If a student or an intruder comes into your classroom pulling your gun will not only endanger you but the children as well in the classroom. Pulling guns on people makes them even more enraged and can lead to a massacre if you aren't the fastest trigger puller. Talking someone out of it is not only easier but is widely used by teachers to defuse situations. Here is a story of a teacher who defused a situation really quickly with just words. http://www.theguardian.com... 4. Guns just make things worse Guns are 22 times more likely to be used in suicide than for self defense A gun in a petty situation can make it lethal and not even for the defender.

It is Unsanitary This link states that \"To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others\" (https://en.wikipedia.org...). In other words, if getting in close contact does these things then it is dangerous for a person to even consider having sex with a dead person. These diseases could then be further spread when the necrophiliacs encounter with other people. 2. It is Immoral Not only does this disrespect the dead (when they have permission or not), but it is a practice that is highly immoral. Having sex with the dead does absolutely nothing good. It only causes harm to the necrophiliacs mental state and it causes diseases to spread. The only thing it does is satisfy some creeps desire to have sex with a dead course. I can guarantee that the majority of people will not be interested in allowing some creep to have special privileges especially since the practice causes harm to society. 3. If you legalize this for the reasons mentioned you could also legalize pedophilia (https://www.google.com...). Are you aware that there is a movement for pedophiles to have the same rights as homosexuals (http://www.greeleygazette.com...)? These ideas about legalization are so bad that I couldn\\'t have made it up. Your arguments could literally be used to support pedophilia. As long as the children agree to what happens and as long as it is deemed as safe, it should be legal. Don\\'t you understand how messed up your argument is? The line has to be draw somewhere. Most of the time we make decisions on what benefits society. Since Necrophilia and pedophilia only (sort of) benefits some creeps and not the society as a whole, it should not be legal. Refuting your arguments: a. Economic Benefit? You make a huge assumption with this point. You assume that there are enough people out there that want their bodies to be molested by some creep after they die. I can assure you that most people don\\'t want this to happen. The business\\' would fail because the majority of people wouldn\\'t want necrophilia to be legalized. Normal people don\\'t want to have sex with dead people. You also need to provide some evidence that this would benefit the economy. b. Happiness Benefits? This sure wouldn\\'t make me happy. The only people it would make happy are the lunatics that want to have sex with dead people. But legalizing it would cause unhappiness to society since it causes diseases to spread. And furthermore, the governments main focus (if at all) is not on the happiness of the people. Governments have to think of the society as a whole and not just on the very few people out there that want special privileges. You also make the assumption that there will be many people would be willing to pay for such a service.', 'I have a feeling this is going to be a fun one.', 'In order to win this debate, I have to prove that necrophilia should be legalized. I do not have to prove that every instance of necrophilia should be legalized, just that it should be under certain circumstances. Outline: Under my plan to legalize necrophilia it will be legal under the following circumstances: 1-Permission was given by either the dead person prior to their death or by their family to be used for sex after they die. 2-The body is preserved, the same way bodies are before burial and thrown out if deemed unusable. (1) Now that has been established, I’ll enter my arguments. C1-Economic Benefits This is simple. The majority of people who would be willing to have their or their family’s corpse for sexual reasons would need some sort of incentive. Incentive wise, this will probably be financial. This means that a business will probably have to be formed dedicated to necrophilia and people would have to pay for it. This will create economic growth, because it will create jobs needed to preserve the body and could be a quite profitable industry. The extent to which this will create economic growth is unknown, but it likely will occur. C2-Happiness Benefits Legalizing necrophilia would increase happiness. If people are willing to pay for necrophilia, it is clearly something they want. Governments obviously want their people to be happy and necrophilia can bring pleasure to people (while not harming anyone). Everyone knows people like sex and necrophilia can be an easy way to get sex, for people who may otherwise have trouble doing so. Plus, many people have sexual fantasies of various types and necrophilia opens up the opportunity for that. However, even if some people don’t understand it, it need not be understood to know it increases happiness for people paying for it. If anyone wishes to pay for something, they deemed it worthwhile. Pretty much everyone values money (to at least some degree), so anyone willing to part with it felt that they would receive something better. Thus, anyone who would pay for necrophilia would see it as worthwhile way to spend their money and believe it is a positive impact and therefore it increases their happiness. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *This argument was pretty short and to the point, but I imagine Con will have a lot to rebut with, so I’ll have more to say in rebuttals and defense.* Source: 1-http://www.afif.asso.fr...', 'Resolution is self-explanatory (necrophilia being sex with a human corpse). Rules:1. No forfeits2. No new arguments in the final round3. First round is acceptance only4. No trolling5. No kritiks6. Violation of rules results in automatic loss.', 'Ok! Thank you for your answer once again. The information seems to be quite interesting. I\\'ve watched some videos about Kristina Golovchenko. Though I believe this case has nothing to do with The Body Positive Movement - Kristina just requires some medical and psychological help. She doesn\\'t even love her body, right? Thus, the case represents a perfect example for my first argument, which was health. Besides, I agree with you that \"there is something in us that needs to be accepted\" though I\\'ve already mentioned it above claiming that \"self-acceptance is a long road.\" Like self-acceptance, tolerance is something that need to be learnt.However, let us go back to the Body Positive Movement. And here goes my third argument, which is FASHION. I explain it below. I will try to be as brief as possible.On the one hand, there are some people who like to show off. On the other hand, there is social trends (such as The Body Positive) that provokes a disruptive social reaction. As a result, people who aim at drawing public attention use these social trends in their own selfish way. For instance, some girls cease shaving their legs and armpits only to post the hairy body parts photos on Instagram etc. People sometimes do stupid things just to show off. The Body Positive Movement here works as an instrument of crime. I do not want to say that showing off is a crime (an instrument of crime is just a figure of speech). Still, we should be careful with such peculiar trends and shouldn\\'t cross the line of prudence unless we want be freaks of course. Besides, people shouldn\\'t follow all the trends blindfold. Fashion changes but a bit of critical thinking is never too much.Considering my third argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'To begin with, thank you for your answer. I find your arguments quite curious. I agree with you that The Body Positive was meant to serve for solely positive goals. Still, as I\\'ve already said above something went wrong. Thus, I can\\'t agree with you completely. So here goes my second argument, which is JUSTIFICATION. I suggest to take a look at the argument, considering two major aspects of each person\\'s life: self-acceptance and self-improvement.Firstly, I insist that self-acceptance is a long road. Even Rome wasn\\'t built in a day therefore it may take you years and years to make the skin you\\'re in better. Self-acceptance is a winding road. It requires direct action including physical exercises, medical intervention, psychological training and so forth. No one disputes that perfection is unreachable. Still, it doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t try. They say practice makes perfect. I say action makes perfect. Self-improvement is a continuous process that shapes our personality, making us stronger and boosting our confidence. Conversely, The Body Positive Movement claiming that \"Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL\" may serve as a justification for inaction.Secondly, there is a well-known fact that some people are lazy, weak or simply indifferent. They simply lack initiative or boldness to take action. Therefore, some Body Positive ideas including your argument \"The <...> movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities.\" may serve as a justification for indifference. Such concept make you calm down, sit down and be happy with what you get. Personally I suppose that people should not stand still. Conversely, I suggest that self-improvement constitutes an essential part of every person\\'s life. Unlike self-acceptance, self-improvement is a road without an end. Seneca once said that Vivere militāre est which meant to live is to struggle. Now let me paraphrase it saying that to live is to develop as self-improvement is a struggle as well. Considering my second argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'Perhaps, many people have heard something about the recent trend - The Body Positive Movement. At first the movement seems to be completely healthy. What could be wrong with accepting your body as it is? Still, the question is not as simple as it may seem. The concept of the Body Positive is often misinterpreted. Such misinterpretations are fatal not only for a single person, but also for a whole society. Therefore I insist that the movement can\\'t be called positive. And here goes my first argument, which is HEALTH.Firstly, you can accept your body as long as it\\'s healthy. I believe there are some things that can\\'t be accepted. Moreover, there are some problems that can\\'t be solved by simple acceptance. For instance, health problems. The thing is that by chance particular health problems affect our appearance, thus causing lack of self-confidence and making the unhealthy person disgusting for other people. To solve the problems person should consult a doctor, which sometimes represent another problem due to psychological and economic factors.Secondly, I\\'m convinced that one can\\'t make himself or herself love his or her body simply saying \"Ok, I accept myself as I am because each body is perfect\" It\\'s a delusion. It\\'s a self-suggestion. It\\'s a placebo. Time spent on worthless declarations and exclamations may negatively affect your condition leading to the health aggravation. On the contrary, to love your body means to respect your body. To respect your body means to take care of your body.Finally, I believe The Body Positive Movement represents a radical reaction to another recent trend which is plastic surgery. While the 2nd variant helps you achieve fake perfection with an operating knife, the 1st one denies perfection as it is. And as a result, it cuts both ways. These two variants only create the illusion of self-confidence. The Body Positive, just as plastic surgery, works for those who refuse to take direct action. Besides, both are unhealthy. People tend to see things in black and white. Why couldn\\'t we see the shades of grey? Or - what is even better - why couldn\\'t we mix them up with more vivid colours?Considering my first argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'I understand you perfectly. I share your opinion that it is necessary to work on ourselves. and we must do this, so as not to justify our flaws in appearance. But what about those people who, for example, have burns all over their body, the most terrible form of acne, which can not be eliminated even by the beauticians of Hollywood, or a psychological dependence on food in connection with a child trauma due to rape (for example - Kristina Golovchenko). Sometimes there is something in us that needs to be accepted, because people are not almighty - they are sometimes really powerless.', 'MEDIA makes us believe that there is something wrong with our bodies. After all, companies and organizations gain greatly when women waste millions on diet fads and untouched gym memberships, when those women could save hundreds by being comfortable in their own skin. The body positivity movement is about health, identity and self-respect. Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL. The appreciation of curves and physical diversity reduces fat-shaming, bulimia, anorexia, depression and bullying among women everywhere, based on the fact that it\"s about acceptance. The body positive movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities. A great way to talk about what body positivity is, is to talk about what it isn\"t. It isn\"t about eroticizing or sexualizing, nor is it about tolerance\" it\"s about softening the frown of superficiality, and revisiting points in history where women were praised for curvaceousness outside of a subgroup.', 'YO LISTEN UP NIGGAZZ MY ESSAY IS BOUT TO DOW DOWN YO.... http://www.youtube.com...1, 2, 3, on the page I write my poetry,This is meant ot be an essay but I structure it stupidly,The writer of the worst essay is me that\\'s too easy to see,It\\'s like a mystical, beast that came in the midst of a bunch of sexy... mother? sister? grandmothers?... sh!t dude...

This fear is not illogical. Plane/drone collisions are possible (though not frequent, if existent), and have lately come closer to colliding than other times. [1]However, the Pro argues that drone should be completely and utterly illegal, which I strongly disagree with. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sets rules and regulations as to who and what are allowed in the big blue sky; and they are seemingly coming closer to an agreement on approving drones above. [2]As the Con, I am arguing that drones should not be illegal in the USA, but rather that the FAA aproves drone use with the given rules and regulations. I do believe there are limits to what drones should be able to do, however, they are generally beneficial and should not be outlawed in this country.[1]: http://www.washingtonpost.com...[2]: http://www.usatoday.com...', 'I want to start off by thanking the Pro for the debate.Also, because there are only three rounds in this debate, I will go ahead and lay out my main points.I will be arguing that drones should not be illegal, and here are my reasonings.The definition of a \"drone\": \"an unmanned aircraft or ship that can navigate autonomously,without human control or beyond line of sight:\"[1]This includes all drones, including UAVs (figure 1.) and camera drones (figure 2.) Figure 1. UAV Reaper Drone [2] Figure 2. Camera Drone. [3]Because the Pro does not specify which drones, I will argue for them all. Despite what Pro states in his opening thesis, drones can actually be extremely beneficial in many ways.1: Drones aide in saving lives. Immediately after natural disasters in which the damage is not yet determined, drones can be used to easily assess the amount of damage and find out the level of danger, and acts as a safe alternative to sending in first responders.2: Drones help in agricultural management. Farmers can use drones specifically to manage crops and pinponts areas that need special attention. This way saves time by only providing care exactly where needed, and improves crop yield.3: Help safely in architechtural maintenance and inspection. Drones can obviously go places where humans cannot, and can also do it without risking lives. For example, drones would easily help inspect places of infrastructure such as below bridges and high buildings.4: Drones give the media access to places: They can film places never reached before, for news and film production. This can be done easily, efficiently, and safely, thanks to drones.Because of my limited time, I will limit my arguments to those above and wait for the Pro to present his. I look forward to this debate and the rebuttals along with it.

Personally I would be freaked out if a drone hit a plane I was on and the pilot had to turn it around because the engine was failing or if the plane fell. Planes carry dozens of people and it would be a serious tragedy if all of them (or most) had lost their lives to some guys joyriding their toy drone for amusement.', 'I believe that drones should be illegal.

I knew it would be something like that. You don't even know what you're saying, do you? You're a lost mind in a simple world. That's why I like debating with you, sir. I always win, because you continuously fail to provide any sources. We are not going to kill 350 million people for the polar bears. It would be roughly the population of the United States and Australia. But if we killed that many people, the United States and Australia would have far less people and we would be worse off because we would have labor shortages, the people would rebel against their government for killing all the depressed people, and the like. There are cheaper, more humane, efficient ways to deal with global warming, like solar, wind, nuclear, and so on. We do not need to kill everybody to stop global warming. Humans are not the problem, the problem is how we produce energy. If you actually cared about global warming, it would be nice. But you don't you just use global warming as a way to express how you hate 95% of all the people on Earth. Actually, though, we could kill all the white supremacists and hate groups. That would help. I ask you, sir, in the comments, to give me just ONE source, one graph or chart which shows that global warming is brought about by the farts of pessimistic people. I doubt you'll be able to.

Many great comedians have low self esteem, that's why they became comedians. Stand up comedy is a kind of mental therapy. Everybody has low self esteem at some point in their lives, we should not have to hide our emotions. When emotions are suppressed, and people only feel happiness, and the happiness is being forced, then that person is not happy. Many people with depression have jobs, stupid, boring jobs, and that's why they're depressed. They're depressed because they're contributing to society. We should change society so people are less depressed. We should make life more fun. Then they wouldn't be depressed anymore. We should allow more pay, shorter work hours, more career diversity. We should make life better for them, not worse. What kind of sick monster ARE you? You said that 350 million people suffer from depression. Killing them would be killing a lot of people. Then more people would be depressed about the people they killed. Sadness is a part of life. We cannot eliminate it. We can only turn our society into a smiling utopia by embracing sadness as a reality. To Hell with your polar bears. Polar bears are not affected by overpopulation, they're affected by CO2 emissions. We need to stop emitting CO2. Then polar bears would be fine. I'm sure some polar bear scientists have depression. And what about the penguins of the walruses? Do you care about them? Or just your stupid POLAR BEARS WE ARE NOT GOING TO COMMIT MASS GENOCIDE UPON ALL MINORITIES TO SAVE ONE ANIMAL What do you think about grizzly bears? Do you hate them for the color of their fur?

They are no different from African people. All grizzly bears do is play basketball and eat fried chicken. 350 million killed is a huge favor to the polar bears. Polar bears did nothing to deserve this evil, yet humans contribute to overpopulation and global warming. That is the population of the United States and Australia combined. Think about it: if the United States and Australia never existed, there would be much more polar bears in today's world. People who are depressed are always paranoid and sad. Paranoid and sad people are always pessimists. Statistics have shown that pessimists fart too much, which is also bad for the environment.

People with low self-esteem are useless people who achieve nothing and are useless to society.

Below are some statistics about depression: https://www.healthline.com... 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression. 350m/7b=5% So 1 in every 20 people suffer from depression. To put this into perspective, only 1 in 200 people are redheads, so depression is much more common than you think. America is the 3rd most populated country in the world, currently at a population of about 324 million. So if we kill off all the depressed people in the world, it is equivalent of killing off everyone in America.

Here is how it will work: Round 1: Acceptance Rounds 2/3: Debate Here we go! Number 4!', 'Thank you as well for offering the topic - I enjoyed it!', 'My opponent’s argument breaks down at step 2. The Taylor expansion for ln(x) has a radius of convergence of 1, around the point x = 1, such that 0<x<2 (as opposed to 0≤x≤2) as I will show below, meaning that the Taylor expansion of ln(x-1) likewise has a radius of convergence of 1 around the point x = 0, such that -1<x<1. By inserting x=1 into the Taylor expansion for ln(x-1), he is causing the series to become divergent, thereby inducing the error in the proof that appears to make 2=1. Proof that the Taylor expansion for ln(x+1) fails at x=1: 1) Differentiating ln(1+x), we have: d/dx (ln(1+x)) = 1/(1+x). 2) Trivially, 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-(-x)) = 1/(1-y), where y≡-x. 3) Taking the Maclaurin expansion of 1/(1-y), we have: 1/(1-y) = 1+y+y^2+y^3+y^4+… 4) Note that the result in step 3 is the expression of a geometric series, which has limits of evaluation at |y|<1. Since y≡-x, |y|<1 is equivalent to |-x|<1. Substituting 1 for x, we have |-1|=1<1, which is false, since 1=1 (again, note the difference between 1<1 and 1≤1). For example, substituting x=1 into the previous expression yields: 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-y) = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+1+(-1)+… This expression is divergent, resulting in the error that causes 2 to appear to equal 1. This concludes the proof.****************************************************************************I greatly enjoyed this debate; you’ll have to challenge me to another some time!', \"I accept this challenge - it'll be nice to actually be able to argue mathematics on here for once, since I've tried starting quite a few math debates before.

Extend this out as a reason why drone strikes aren\\'t working, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.My opponent also never responds to the second Blum et. al card talking about how drone striking terrorist leaders hurts our intelligence gathering abilities, which harms out abilities to stop terrorist plots long-term. Extend this out for why drone strikes hurt our ability to fight terrorism, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.She also never responds to the Hunter card talking about how drone striking terrorist leaders actually doesn\\'t significantly hamper terrorist activities. Extend this out for a reason why drone strikes don\\'t actually work, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.Also, extend out the Speigel Online card talking about how killing one terrorist with drone strikes took sixteen attempts and cost 321 innoncent lives just to get one terrorist. She responds to this by just saying that it\\'s \"collateral damage\" necessary to stop terrorism, but a) we don\\'t even need to be fighting terrorism right now, refer back to the Mueller evidence which says that more people die from drowning in their own bathtubs than from terrorist attacks, and b) just brushing off the deaths of 321 innocent people as \"collateral damage\" doesn\\'t actually justify the use of drones. We shouldn\\'t be contenting ourselves with a faulty method of offing terrorist leaders. We need a method that takes out the man we want to take out and only the man we want to take out on the first try. If it\\'s taking sixteen tries and costing hundreds of innocent lives just to take out one leader, that\\'s not #worth, that\\'s inefficient and ineffective. We need to stop drone striking and come up with something better, not justify the murder of innocent lives as \"necessary for the safety of America\". All of these independantly work to show how Drone striking doesn\\'t work and only makes things worse for us, which shows that we shouldn\\'t be using drone strikes for modern warfare. If we shouldn\\'t be using drone strikes for modern warfare, they certainly aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare. Then, my opponent doesn\\'t respond to a single claim I make in my second argument. Extend out the Mueller evidence which is showing how terrorism really isn\\'t something to worry about right now because more people are dying from drowning in the tub than from acts of terror, showing how unnecessary drone strikes are right now. She also never responds to my alternative to drone striking, which is to send a small detachment of US special forces to support the local Pakistani military to limit cross-border travel and to help train local forces to better combat terrorism. This a) works to stop terrorism over the long-term, which means it\\'s going to work better than the ineffective drone striking, and b) meets her criteria of not letting American soldiers die because it\\'s putting them in a supportive role, meaning they won\\'t be in the line of fire. This means that my alternative is better by my criteria as well as hers. So, to put it simply: my opponent doesn\\'t really respond to anything I said in the last round, rather just restates her own points. My points are a direct counter to her points. Extend them out. I win.', 'Thanks to pro for starting this debate. I intend to attack the resolution from two different angles:1. That targeted killings are actually effective. If they\\'re ineffective, then there would be no reason to employ them in modern warfare, thus making them not necessary.2. That drone attacks are necessary to conduct modern warfare. If there are other avenues of waging warfare other than using UAVs/Drones, then they aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.With that let\\'s dive right into things.Argument One: Targeted Killings don\\'t actually work/make things worse. Killing a terrorist leader causes more to grow and retaliate. Hezbollah empirics prove. Blum et. al(1) \"eliminating leaders of terrorist organizations ... may ... effect, the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace them. The decapitating of the organization may also invite retaliation by the other members and followers of the organization. ... when Israel assassinated ... Mussawi ... a more charismatic and successful leader, ... Nassrallah, succeeded ... The armed group then avenged the assassination of its former leader in two separate attacks, blowing up Israeli and Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, ...\" Targeted killing which relies on intelligence hurts the ability of the government to gain intelligence on terrorists. Blum et. al(1) \"Targeted killing may also interfere with important gathering of critical intel ... The threat of being targeted will drive current leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their ... activities ... difficult. ... if these leaders are found and killed, instead of captured, ... counterterrorism forces lose the ability to interrogate them to obtain potentially valuable information ...\" Really big and strong terrorist groups are not affected by targeted killing empirically. Hunter(3) \"attempting to reduce a group’s operational capabilities through targeted killing is of limited utility when posed against groups practicing advanced security measures. ... to ensure al Qaeda’s operational effectiveness, the group stresses the need to maintain internal security, dividing its operatives into overt and covert members functioning under a single leader…al Qaeda’s global network has survived by its members strictly adhering to the principles of operational security. the continued “success” of al Qaeda (measured in its ability to conduct major terrorist attacks worldwide despite international efforts to eradicate it) is a testament to its members’ adherence to operational security. ... this ongoing viability is evidence of the ineffectiveness of targeted killing (as practiced by the U.S. in this case) ...\" In trying to kill one man, drones killed approximately 321 people, from Spiegel Online(5) \"What is the cost of rendering a terrorist harmless once and for all by killing him? During the course of 14 months, the CIA used unmanned and heavily armed small aircraft known as drones to stage 15 strikes against the presumed locations of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. On Aug. 5, 2009, on the 16th try, the drones finally managed to kill Baitullah Mehsud. ... and 11 others were killed. ... But the hunt for Mehsud cost the lives of far more than 11 people. According to estimates, ... 321 people died in the course of the 16 attempts to eliminate Mehsud -- and it is certain that not all of them were Taliban fighters.\" Argument Two: Drone Attacks aren\\'t necessary/Other avenues of warfarePost 9/11 Terrorist attacks are overrated – more people die from drowning in bathtubs. Mueller(2) \"Two publications ... have independently provided lists of violence committed by Muslim extremists outside of such war zones ... whether that violence be perpetrated by domestic terrorists or by ones with substantial international connections. ... The lists include not only attacks by al-Qaeda, but also those by its imitators, ... as ones by groups with no apparent connection to it whatever. ... the total number of people killed in the five years after 9/11 in such incidents comes to some 200-300 per year. ... it hardly suggests that al-Qaeda\\'s destructive capacities are monumental. ... over the same period far more people have perished in the United States alone in bathtubs drownings ...\"Alternative to Drone strikes: Support and Cooperate with Pakistani security forces, Innocent(4)\"A better strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is for the United States to focus on limiting cross-border movement by supporting local Pakistani security forces with a small number of US Special Forces personnel. To improve fighting capabilitiesand enhance cooperation, Washington and Islamabad must increase the number of military-to-military training programs to help hone Pakistan\\'s counterterrorism capabilities and serve as a confidence-building measure to lessen the Pakistan Army\\'s tilt toward radicalism.\" As such, I\\'ve shown that not only do drone strikes not work, not only that they make things worse, but also that we have no need for drone strikes right now and that there are other options for combating terror outside of drone strikes.

For some at least one factor was the consideration of the hundreds thousands of Iraqi and Afghanistan people died and suffered over near to the length of a generation. These same people could also be expected to be angered by the death of our own sons and daughters, friends and family, who sacrifice their lives, physical and mental well being, to serve the Country's interests. The majority though lose sleep over the death of the innocents not counted as our allies and brethren. They are collateral damage, necessary to keep America and our children safe. That what we are told, not just by Fox News, but by the other major networks as well. Imagine a world where people who had the same financial interests in the military industrial complex were also heavily invested in the mass media. Welcome to it. The drones remove a large number of our soldiers from harms way to carry out certain missions, or executions, as the case may be. This is good, we don't want our soldiers to die, and could any ethical or moral reason be good enough to surmount that? It depends how the drones are used of course, but those who control them are those in power, and those in power usually, historically speaking, probably don't have the best interests of the people at heart. Not really. Not the people beyond the sphere of their family, friends and co workers, or their bubble, to be precise. They might believe they do, but that to better sleep at night. Argument 2: Drones are always necessary. Its a more effective way to destroy our target then actually going out there and risking there life's. You say if we had drones that we wouldn't have soldiers, in fact they could be National guard which is almost the same thing but instead they are in their hometown helping out,\", \"I would like to start of by just saying I have great respect for our military and we have lost many soldiers due to man-to man war. More soldiers die fighting face to face then actually drones that due the job. So why send our troops into war and risk their life's when sending in a nuclear drone, which wont take our soldiers life's but take down the target.\", \"Kids should definetly have cell phones.

What if your at a movie with some friends and an adult comes and starts walking around you and acting creepy. Without a phone you can't call somebody to pick you up you will just have to deal with this strange adult. This is just one of many scenarios of an emergency. Kids need to be social in order for them to develope correct social skills and learn how to act around people. With cell phones kids can talk to each other whenever they want and can arrange hang outs much easier. Cell phones teach kids responsibility.

REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human Again, all my opponent has argued here is that the potential life inside the woman’s womb is part of the species homo sapiens, and that it will evolve and eventually become a human being. But again, is this enough to justify on illegalizing abortion? No. My opponent dismisses my ‘sentience’ argument because it is a failed theory and unnecessary. It isn’t, that’s why embryos/fetuses have no rights in the first place. I will focus on the sentience and consciousness, which the embryo has not. My opponent states that my theory of the embryo having no sentience relates to a person in a coma. Two things, first, embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because personhood is defined by the state). Second, a person in a coma was obviously already born, and with legal rights thus making him a human being. Let’s take a look at the ‘bear’ scenario my opponent gave in R2; where one man mistakes a person for a bear thus shooting him and killing him accidentally. Now, even though we can say that the benefit of the doubt will go life, we still wouldn’t consider this action to become a killing of an innocent person (i.e.: murder). Why? Because the man thought he was shooting a bear (which can be a danger to him), rather than a real, sentient human. Relating to abortion, if we outlaw most abortions, and when a woman and her doctor think they're killing a non-viable being, they would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, but it’s hard to judge someone criminally negligent for not personally believing that a pre-sentient embryo is a viable person when we don't actually know this to be the case. There isn’t any sufficient evidence to prove that an embryo is a human being in mind. If we’re following PRO’s logic on embryo being humans, then abortion would be tragic and lethal and should result to murder in all cases, there should be no exceptions, meaning that this will result to many bad consequences. As for it being just and moral, I will address my opponent’s Spiegel argument and morality rebuttal in my Utilitarianism defense below, but to his statement saying, “To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust.”, If I may ask, dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? I’ve already addressed this issue and my opponent hasn’t fully accurately backed this claim up. Please extend my previous rebuttal and the arguments regarding the advantage of abortion and the disadvantage of back alley abortions on the economy. Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. Re: Hippocratic Oath Violation 4 Issues: All arguments from this source {10}. 1) This oath is obsolete and irrelevant since it is historically taken by physicians. This oath is also invalid since it’s a stretch to even argue it. 2) This oath is not binding by law, there is no law required that forces doctors to take this when performing abortion. So what if they break it? 3) Non-doctors perform abortions too. ‘Nuff said. 4) Quoted oath is false. The quoted statement my opponent cited is from the original version, which has already been modernized. And performing an abortion isn’t stated in it. ERGO) This argument is false, invalid and irrelevant. DEFENSE/CASE De: Morality My opponent dismisses this argument stating that it is irrelevant and that I have the BOP. But please note that PRO made this argument first (but forgot to put it in R2), so it’s already proven that killing innocent humans can be morally permissible, and that an embryo is NOT a killing of an innocent human being. Now, to address his rebuttal: Okay, let’s say that contraceptives failed, thus the woman woke up pregnant. It was the woman’s intention to use birth control and wished not have a life attached her, but it failed. Thus making this Utilitarianism argument very much valid. There are also cases where women are morons, they are promiscuous and do not know the outcomes of having sex, we shouldn’t let the woman and the baby suffer. Actually no, there are different kinds of pregnancies {11} which can complicate and danger the woman’s everyday life, like Ectopic pregnancies, RH negative diseases, Group B Strep, Gestational Diabetes, etc. These illnesses limit the woman’s ability to do things, work, shop, take care of stuff. De: Fetus =/= Legal Human I’ve already proven why a fetus is not a human and that the ‘coma’ argument is blatantly false. I’ve also argued why fetuses shouldn’t receive or be considered human. Extend. De:Fetus not really innocent This relates to my morality argument. De: Violates Rights OK, I apologize. I haven’t read the definitions accurately. But the ‘rights’ I’m talking about here are not only legal, but moral, universal or God-given rights that are being violated. In a Utilitarianist view, we need to consider on what is morally permissible and we must consider what the best interest of the mother and child is. Right to choose & to have dignity: Women should have the right to be respected by society, if they do not want children that should be respected. Again, there are cases where birth control fails, where women do not know the outcomes of having children. Most of these women are mostly in poverty where they couldn’t economically handle having a child. {12}. Mothers are responsible for their children, we need to value their right on what they think is safer and right for their children and environment. Do you want children to live in the streets, to suffer and live with abusive parents? De: Crime Yes, this is a US-only debate. I’m introducing the NYT source as pattern evidence. My opponent counters this argument by citing a source from a book, thus must be considered unreliable, I don’t normally attack sources that way but it’s crucial to what we’re arguing. Now, to further clarify abortion=crime correlation; I will quote what I said in the previous round; Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {9}. That source also states that and I quote, “Many women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to self-induce their abortions or going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. During this time, hospital emergency room staff treated thousands of women who either died or were suffering terrible effects of abortions provided without adequate skill and care.” Now, obviously, illegalizations have no effect due to that source, also this that statement wasn’t accurately refuted by PRO. About my NYT source, please note that the WHO did a research (in countries where abortion is illegal) where they found out that 20 million unsafe abortions are performed per year & 67K of those women die, and between 2 -7 million of these risky abortions result in long-term damage or illnesses. This is only a pattern or what might happen to the US if we illegalize abortion due to back-alley abortion {8}. My opponent needs to prove that illegalizing is more beneficial to society regardless of back-alley abortions where criminals profit more than the state, where mothers have more health risks and are endangered. CITATIONS http://www.debate.org...\", \"Thanks for responding. REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human My opponent first noted that he’ll focus on the fetus because most abortions happen in the fetal period. This is false, since he didn’t give a source, I’d like to point out that 9 in 10 abortions in the US occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy {1a} {1b}. That means that the fetus isn’t fully developed yet {2}, which means that the pregnancy is still in its embryonic period {3a}. An embryo is not (yet) a fetus and it’s also not a person and therefore doesn’t have rights. The embryo is not viable or sentient, it cannot survive outside the uterus/womb {3b} so it would be ridiculous to grant them rights. As for his argument on fetuses being human, as you can see, all my opponent has argued that a fetus has life and that it will eventually be human, this is insufficient. It needs more concise evidence, PRO needs to prove that a fetus is conscious, that it is sentient and is aware of its surroundings, existence, thoughts, sensations. But still, this fetus = human argument isn't enough and doesn't entirely mean that we should illegalize abortion. Considering that I’ve shown that the vast majority of abortions occur in the embryonic period, this argument pretty much falls. Furthermore, PRO must prove that an embryo is still as equal as a fetus or a human being, he also needs to show sufficient proof that it is enough to ban them. I’m expanding my rebuttal on this in my contentions below. Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? My opponent seems to be confusing us with calculations and claims that the USFG could have saved 21 trillion USD if Roe wasn’t decided because 50 million un-aborted people could’ve lived by now and each would have earned an average of $42K. This is utterly ridiculous and misleading. Out of those 50 million, how can you say for sure that they didn’t migrate to other countries, or if they even have a decent job, or if they died or have an illness. How can you say for sure that if Roe was overturned by then, this won’t affect 50 million abortions? Women will still abort nevertheless, since they have the means and free will to do whatever they want, regardless of the rule of law. Overall, this argument is a shallow attempt made by PRO which is ambiguous. Next, abortion costs vary {4}, but it isn’t necessarily $350 since there are private orgs funding women and helping them on family planning. There are clinics that provide cheap abortions for women who are poor. There are also state-funded clinics that operate on these practices. So this just means that the state has some profits. Also, since an average of 1.21 million abortions happen each year {1a} and if we multiply that to the costs ($300 to $1000 approx.) {4}, the total would be over $1B profit. Seriously an economical advantage. But let’s look at the downside, if we illegalize abortion, back alley abortions will happen anyway. Would you want the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state? CASE These are my contentions for now, I reserve the right to drop or add more arguments & references later on. C1: Morality This premise actually irrelevant to the topic since this is too broad and controversial. Morality and religion has nothing to do with the legislature and that the government has no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. Furthermore, my opponent failed to show that killing innocent human beings (in this case, the fetuses) are wrong. It seems he forgot, but nevertheless, I will show you why this is not always the case. Utilitarianism A simple definition of Utilitarianism is that it determines the moral worth of an action only by its resulting outcome, and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences {5}. Now, a moral philosopher, Judith Thomson offered a thinking experiment {6} {7}: Imagine waking up one morning and find yourself attached to a famous violinist by means of a long tube, that violinist is unconscious. Doctors tell you that if you remove this tube, the Violinist will die. Doctors also tell you that you have to limit your time and you have to eat more. Also, because a parasite-like being is attached to you, you can’t go to work because you cannot concentrate and may suffer from public humility. What if you are poor and you need to work? Is it permissible to kill the violinist? What would most people do? This argument theory proves that even though fetuses/embryos have the right to life, it’s still morally permissible to abort them. Thomson argued that it is. She says that the right to life does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something—the use of your body—to which he has no right. This moral argument relates to women’s rights and why fetuses shouldn’t have rights. See below. C2: Fetus Argument Since the vast majority aborts during the embryonic period, I’m not sure why we need to debate the fetus’ biological form since it has no relevance to the illegalization of this practice, but I’ll proceed anyway. A fetus being human is highly a controversial issue and it will probably never end. Fetus not legally human. Though a fetus can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens, it is not a sentient human being that is a full-fledged member of society. It is neither conscious nor viable. Thus making it not have rights and must not receive the same rights as fully developed humans. If we declare abortion murder should we declare miscarriages manslaughter? Furthermore, as I said, my opponent needs to provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being. ‘Having a life and eventually being a human’ is NOT enough. Fetus not really innocent Addressing the theory presented, J.T stated that even if the embryo/fetus has a right to life, it does NOT have a right to use the pregnant woman's body, so technically, the fetus is not at all innocent as it invades the woman’s privacy and violates women’s rights. Ergo, abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. C3: Illegalization Downside I’m running out of characters, so I’ll make this brief and continue next round. Violates Rights The mother’s right to life is essential, and if we illegalize abortion, we are violating that right. There are many scenarios where the mother’s life is at risk unless she aborts, if we deprive them of aborting, we are not only killing the mother, but also giving society a bad name. It also violates dignity and respect. Women who are raped should not suffer 9 months of carrying a child she did not want, especially if she is poor. A woman should not suffer or be forced to carry a fetus for months. This is a breach to human dignity. The government has the obligation to protect its citizens from harm, if a doctor knows that the baby is ill in the womb, he should advice the mother for her to make a decision. Criminalization also deprives women on the right to choose and healthcare. Since I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion violates rights and that it poses a danger to women, this practice should remain legal. Esp. in the circumstances of rape, incest, health risks, medical need, etc. Crime Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {8}. The NY times also showed statistics that abortion whether legal or not will not change society {9}. CONCLUSION In other words, I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion is very much a disadvantage to economy and society and does more harm than good. I’ve negated my opponent’s premises and made my arguments. I await PRO’s response. Good luck! CITATIONS http://goo.gl...\", 'I apologize for the delay. Thanks for instigating, good luck and happy holidays!', 'C1:Fetus=HumanMy opponent dismisses my argument that the fetus/embryo is part of the H. Sapiens species without any valid justification. Also, my opponent has dropped one of my most important points which is that the fetus/embryo has all the human DNA that will ever be developed in its lifetime. Biologically speaking, the embryo is not a potential human life, it is a human life. Coupled with the facts that is it from the H. Sapiens species and has all human DNA, there is no valid justification for not considering the embryo to be a human being. My opponent tries to dismiss my \"coma argument\" by saying that a person in a coma already already has legal rights and is not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights. Legal Rights The argument is moot and invalid from Round 1. Current legality is not of a matter of concern in this debate. Therefore the fact that the person in the coma already had legal rights is dismissed. Not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights I quote from my opponent:\"embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because person hood is defined by the state)\"The second part of the argument can be dismissed. How the State currently defines person hood is irrelevant. My opponent states that there is a distinct differentiation between supposed rights of a human being outside the womb and inside the womb. First of all, he has not provided any valid justification for why the human being inside the womb should have less rights than the human being outside the womb. Second, if being inside/outside the womb makes so much difference, then what is the difference between a fetus ten minutes before birth and immediately after birth? Except for the surrounding environment, there are absolutely no differences between these two circumstances. This point of my opponent is therefore refuted. C1: Bear ScenarioIt seems as if my opponent has misunderstood the bear scenario. First of all, the point isn\\'t whether or not the person who shot the gun was doing it accidentally. The point is that it is not worth it to take the risk when there could be a real human being behind the bushes. The man did not think that he was shooting a bear. He knew that it could have been a bear or a human, a 50/50 chance. Whether or not society condemns him is irrelevant. C1: Spiegel\\'s Argument My opponent has virtually dropped this point and he untruthfully proclaims that he will rebut it in the morality segment. His only defense was \"dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? \". Death is natural, but that whole argument also hinges on pregnancy having special social value and being the precondition to society. Death does not have any special social value. In fact, if everybody was immortal, and therefore without death, society would be able to function. But without pregnancy, the precondition for society in our world, we would all die out. My point is that even though death is natural, it is not the indispensable means by which society is created nor does it have any special social value. C2: Economical Disadvantage My opponent has done literally nothing here nor in the previous round to rebut my points. I have shown them to be valid under average statistics. I have also left out the fact that many abortion are taxpayer funded which adds to the economic societal detriment. He states that \"Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. \" However, he has nothing to back up his assumption. Black market profits are still economically beneficial as the provider obtains money which he can spend on various societal goods. The people who illegally performed the abortions still spent the money back to society. C3: Hippocratic OathI will address each of my opponent\\'s concerns:1) This oath is not historically taken by physicians; it is still taken by physicians. This also an appeal to novelty. Just because something is old, does not make it any less valid.2) This oath focuses on morality, instead of binding legality. Not only does this debate have nothing to do with current legality, but just because something is not binding, does not make it any less valid.3) False. In the US, only physicians can perform abortions. (8)4) False. According to the National Library of Medicine, that is the original oath. (9)C4: MoralityJust because I did not put it in Round 2, does not mean that I concede that killing innocent human beings is acceptable. Not only is this common logic, but also backed up by my Round 3 rebuttal. My opponent has provided two examples of when he thinks that my case would fall apart due to technicalities. I will rebut both of them. It is highly unlikely that both birth control and physical contraceptives would fail when used together. Anyways, it is possible. My opponent has completely neglected the part where I previously said that by engaging in the act of coitus, the participants are automatically taking up a risk. Contraceptives might reduce the risk, but they don\\'t eliminate them. Whether sub-consciously or consciously, the risk has already been taken and the blame is put on the people engaging in the act of coitus. To put the blame on the baby is absurd and illogical. When a woman\\'s life is threatened, abortion is permissible, as stated by our rules. Also, even if the woman\\'s life is not threatened but she is somewhat temporarily disabled, the killing of the baby is not justified simply because of a temporary \"disability. Would it be justified to kill your child if he would not let you go to work? No. C5: Fetus =/= Legal HumanAgain, the term legal is irrelevant to this debate. You have definitely not proven that the coma argument is invalid. Readers can refer back to \"Fetus=Human\". C6: Fetus not really innocentRefuted as part of Utilitarianism last round and Morality this round. C7: Violates RightsMy opponent mentions \"moral, universal or God-given rights\". He has introduced these so called \"rights\" without any proof of them even existing. My opponent\\'s introduction and statement of these so called \"rights\" absurd and rendered moot. Right to choose and to have dignity- Nobody is forcing women to have children. If they really don\\'t want to then they can abstain from having coitus. Just because birth control fails, it does not automatically give the women the right to abort. As previously discussed, a certain level of risk is accepted simply by engaging in coitus. Just because someone cannot economically handle a child, does not give them the right to kill it. Many different approaches can be taken such as adoption. Also, having lived is better than never having lived. C8: CrimeMy opponent\\'s evidence is not based in the US and therefore is nullified and moot. There is no proof that these patterns would have been replicated in the US. I provided a source which stated otherwise, but apparently my opponent automatically thinks that a book source is invalid with no justification whatsoever. Also, President of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Mary Calderone pointed out in a 1960 American Journal of Health article that Dr. Kinsey showed in 1958 that 84% to 87% of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing. Dr. Calderone herself concluded that \"90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by physicians. \" It seems that the vast majority of the alleged “back-alley butchers” eventually became the “reproductive health providers” of our present day. (7)Conclusion Embryo is a human. Immoral to kill humans. Abortion is an economical detriment. Women do not have a right to abortion. By having coitus, they are exposing themselves to the risk. I hope that my opponent does not introduce any new information or sources in the next round. Sources:. http://goo.gl...Great debate.', 'Before I proceed, I would like to point out that I made a mistake. Most abortions are in fact performed in the embryonic Period and I will slightly change my argument according to this. This should cause no problem to my opponent as all of his arguments will apply this also. Fetus=HumanA human is defined as (1):A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. SapiensBelonging to a species is determined from the DNA of an organism. From the moment of conception, the new organism is a member of the H. Sapiens species. The organism has all of the human DNA that will ever be used or developed in its lifetime that is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. My opponent has failed to address perhaps the strongest point of my case, the fact that an embryo has all human DNA that will ever be obtained in its life. If a human is a member of the H. Sapiens, then a embryo is a human. My opponent has stated that sentience and awareness are necessary for human life. This is obviously not true. By my opponent\\'s theory, a person who is in a coma is not a person, even though he is. Coma patients cannot feel anything outside of them and are unconscious, yet they are still human. This proposition that human life depends on sentience is absurd. Also, pregnancy is an essential tool in the building of society. It is responsible for the development and growth of mankind. Not only this, but it is also a natural cycle by the human body. To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust. Consider an alteration of this argument made by Jim Spiegel:(2)1. Pregnancy is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.4. Abortions which seek to terminate and reject a pregnancy constitute a rejection of the special value of pregnancy.5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.6. Therefore, abortion is unjust. My opponent has also asked me to prove that if a embryo were a human, abortion should be banned. This premise is self-explanatory. It is immoral to kill innocent human beings that have done nothing wrong and are coming into existence because of a natural cycle called pregnancy. Economical DisadvantageI used average statistics to determine the calculations. Some people people might have had a worse job, some better. Some might have lived longer, others shorter. These are averages. Some people might have migrated to other countries, but there are no concrete statistics. Even if an unlikely 10% migrated, it would still be an economical detriment. Also, about 14% of all abortions in the United States are paid for with public funds, virtually all of which are state funds. 17 states pay for abortions for some women. (6) This adds on to the detriment. Also, the average abortions costs about $350. (6)My Opponent\\'s CaseC1:MoralityMy opponent is stating the government should have no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. However, the concept of human rights in it self, requires a certain set of morals to recognize them such as not murder, stealing, etc. .. Again, my opponent is stating that it is not necessarily immoral to kill millions of innocent human beings. He has the massive BOP to back this up. C1:UtilitarianismMy opponent has brought a seemingly irrelevant argument into this discussion.1. The person who randomly woke up with a violinist connected has not been previously aware of any sort of risk that this might happen. It simply happened. But this situation does not happen in a pregnancy. Unless CON can show me a woman who doesn\\'t know that sex might lead to pregnancy, the woman has taken the risk upon herself just by having sex. Whether it be subconsciously or consciously, by knowing the possible circumstances in which the sex might result in, she has subjected herself to the risk. When somebody chooses to be subjected to a risk and the risk happens, the blame should only be on themselves, not the innocent human being inside of them. The only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in Round 1. 2. The circumstances of the attached violinist and pregnancy are highly different. Pregnant women can still work, earn a salary, go to school, and our society does not condone embarrassment of pregnant women. C2: Fetus not legally humanI already partly addressed this argument in the \"fetus=human\" rebuttal. What I have to mention is that in Round 1, it was explicitly stated that \"This debate is about the future legality of abortion, therefore all present legal arguments for abortion are currently not valid. \". My opponent has accepted the definition as this point is not only violating the rules, but also an invalid point as was mentioned in Round 1. This point should automatically be thrown out, but I will provide a brief rebuttal. My opponent has stated that because an embryo is not conscious, it should not be granted rights. This is false. People in a comatose are given rights are not conscious nor viable. My opponent stated that I need to \" provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being\". This has already been done. An embryo or a fetus has all the possible DNA that a human can ever obtain in its lifetime. DNA makes an organism part of a specific species. The embryo cannot be described as \"can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens,\" (by my opponent). The embryo is a member of the H. Sapiens. C2: Fetus not really innocent1. By having sex, the women is taking the risk of pregnancy. If the woman allows the sex to happen on her own will, then she is allowing the embryo to be inside her. My opponent also has not stated why the embryo or fetus does not have a right to use the pregnant women\\'s body. If it does not have a right to do this, then all pregnancies should be aborted as it is a violation of the rights of the female.2. My opponent has stated that abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. I agree. This was addressed in Round 1 rules. In circumstances in which the female is at the risk of dying or has been raped, abortion is permissible. C3: Violates RightAgain, this has all been addressed in the rules of Round 1. Abortion is permissible in cases of when the women has been raped, incest, or when her life has been threatened. This point is again a violation of the rules and should be disregarded. C3: CrimeMy opponent and I have previously agreed that this debate applies solely to the United States. My opponent\\'s sources are flawed. If you take a look at his #8 source, it applies to worldwide trends in the legalization/de legalization of abortion. It doesn\\'t mention the US and instead talks about Eastern Europe, Uganda, and South Africa. This source and information is invalid. In fact, \"a reasonable estimate for the actual number of criminal abortions per year in the pre legalization era [prior to 1967] would be from a low of 39,000 (1950) to a high of 210,000 (1961) and a mean of 98,000 per year. \"(3)Compared to the 1.5 million+ abortions per year after Roe v. Wade,(4) we can conclude that the legalization/de legalization of abortion causes massive differences. Case:My opponent has given me a chance to post another small contention:The Hippocratic OathAs all abortions today are performed by doctors, all doctors must take the Hippocratic Oath. (5)It states that:\"I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion\". An abortion is clearly a violation of the Hippocratic Oath and cannot be deemed to continue. Sources:. http://goo.gl...', 'Now onto mine. The fetus is a humanMy first contention is that a fetus is human. I will choose to focus on a fetus, not a zygote or an embryo because most abortions happen during the fetal period. A fetus is simply the combination of the male sperm, and the women’s ovum. Combining the two creates an entirely unique organism, not alike to its mother or father. There is no doubt that the fetus is biologically alive. It fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life: (1) metabolism, (2) growth, (3) reaction to stimuli, and (4) reproduction. (1) A fetus will, in no doubt, become a human being. There is absolutely no question about it. A fetus will turn into a living, breathing, and thinking organism like you and I. So why deny it the same rights that are given to us? Lets take this for an example: You are a hunter out in the woods. You see something rustle in the bushes. You aren’t sure whether it’s a bear, or a human. Is it worth it to take that shot, knowing that there could be a human there? That directly relates to abortion. Even if you aren’t sure whether the fetus is a human, is it worth it to take that risk? Benefit of the doubt should always be given to life, not death. One very important point is that the entire biological and scientific communities agree on one common definition for human life: one human individual’s life begins at the completion of the union of his father’s sperm and his mother’s ovum, a process called \"conception,\" \"fertilization\" or \"fecundation. \" This is according to the one of the only embryology textbooks used in medical schools: Langman’s Medical Embryology written by Thomas W. Sadler PhD(2) Continuing on with the point that a fetus is a human, we have to realize that not only is the fetus being created by the human’s natural processes, it is a unique human individual, just as each of us is. Resulting from the union of the female gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes) and the male gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes), the conceptus is a new—although tiny—individual. A fetus has all of the basic components needed for human life, so to kill it with an abortion would be equivalent of killing a human. It has its own unique genetic code (with forty-six chromosomes), which is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. From this point until death, no new genetic information is needed to make the unborn entity a unique human individual. In fact according to biology, human development begins with conception. From the moment of conception, the being is complete. Nothing else — no bits or pieces — will be naturally added from this time until the old man or woman dies — nothing but nutrition and oxygen. This being is programmed from within, moving forward in a self-controlled, ongoing process of growth, development, and replacement of his or her own dying cells. To argue the fact that this is not human goes against any scientific and medical standards, which is what our current society is based upon. (3) According to Keith Moore in Essentials of Human Embryology: \"Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). \"Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being. \" To summarize the first contention: I have concluded that a fetus is a living being, is a unique human individual, and is simply a stage of development in the human process. Abortion is economically harmful Abortion is, in fact, economically detrimental to society as a whole. Lets look at some stats. Since the legalization of Roe V Wade in the United States, there have been about 50 million abortion. (4) Abortions cost about $350 dollars to the average citizen. (5) Therefore, over the years that abortion has been legal in the US, the private sector has received 1 750 000 000 000. In other words, one trillion seven-hundred fifty billion dollars. That seems like a large amount, but the amount that the state lost is more. The average US salary is 42 000 per year. (6) The average life expectancy in the US is 78.1 years (7). Abortion was legal from 1973 to current, or 38 years. Since we can assume that every person who wasn\\'t aborted would live to this day, the calculations are relatively simple. Multiply the number of abortion (50 000 000) by (42 000) the average salary per year and then multiply it by 78, the average life expectancy. We receive the number 2 100 000 000 000. That is the amount of money that the State could have gained by not performing abortions. That is considerably larger than the money gained from abortions. Therefore, abortion is a societal economic detriment.

Even the terminator would be killed by an internal explosion. Although this and almost all of the examples are comic relief, he can assumingly use these powers at will. Unlike Roger rabbit rules. (He can only use them when it would be funny.) (2): In an episode where Squidward is describing a murder (Nickelodeon material, right)Spongebob imitates it by chopping off his own arm and grasping it regrowing his arm and cutting off the opposite hand in a wash rinse repeat fashion. I can liken him to a silver terminator right now. (3): Although he is not physically destroyed, in a bullying episode an extremely schwarzenneger-esque fish repeateadly punches him with not a single wince of pain or a drop of sweat. This proceeds for a period of over 24 hours and the fish eventually passes out.

He has the ability to run cartoonishly fast to the point of creating a tornado and burning himself into nothingness. He still sruvives of course and is fully able to gain these superpowers again but never does. (2): In an extremely creepy episode when he is locked in a cave and trying to eat a freind as cannibalism he uses a few lures and traps but manages to last a long time without food. Although the terminator does not need food this could help in the case of Bikini bottom turning into something similar to the deserts and wastelands in Terminator 4. Mentality: (1): When spongebob is fighting a co-worker over a promotion, he goes into a military attitude similar to that of patton and lays elaborate predator style traps to prevent him from going to his workplace. These are so ingenious and cartoonish they would no doubt alone defeat a terminator easier than a pool of molten metal. As an added note for stamina he runs extremely fast to beat the opponent he runs to the workplace for a long point of time although not a supernatural amount. (2): As he is constantly practicing karate with a freind he has (I am serious) trained himself to be aware for any sneak attack and even has Karate gloves handy. Strength: (1): Spongebob has over the past been trained in Karate, Wrestling, Olympics and even has a spatula which can shoot patties as projectiles with shotgun force. I am not making this up. (2): As a phenominally bad driver, it is a running theme to have him destroy the town, buildings and all unintentionnaly. He would be great in a drive by. Over all spongebob wwith no holds barred would be a perfect opponent for anyone out there and might even compare to a silver terminator.', \"I believe that it is a little known fact Spongebob Squarepants is a BAMF. Anyone with a reply may answer and for the time being I will not give away spongebob's powers.

I look forward to this most epic of battles.\", 'Apologies for forfeiting the previous round. Certainly Christianity is the largest single organization for healthcare in the world, but with over a billion members there aren\"t many organizations that could offer that level of service, but that\"s not to say they wouldn\"t if possible. This has nothing to do with Christianity, this is a want to help your fellow man, an instinctive drive that all people and societies need in order for us to survive and evolve. To dispute your point on the church starting the orphanage movement I will direct you to this piece from the writings of Plato, many hundreds of years before the church was helping orphans, by the way, no doubt they were orphans due to some war funded by the church. Plato (Laws, 927) says: \"Orphans should be placed under the care of public guardians. Men should have a fear of the loneliness of orphans and of the souls of their departed parents. A man should love the unfortunate orphan of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child. He should be as careful and as diligent in the management of the orphan\\'s property as of his own or even more careful still.\"(1) Furthermore, you mention Jane Addams, but a recent study of her found that Jane Addams \"had come to epitomize the force of secular humanism.\" Her image was, however, \"reinvented\" by the Christian churches.(2) Here we can see that you have fallen into a trap laid by the church, claiming that one of the brightest lights of humanity belonged to their ranks, when in reality Jane Addams was agnostic at best and indeed a secular humanist. Now to quote you directly: \"He (god) wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves.\" Now this argument is heavily flawed to me, why should this apparent god receive praise for all the good humanity achieves, yet when something bad happens it\"s the humans who are at fault, now to me that seems to be a slight double standard. Now I will leave you with this. In mathematics a positive multiplied by a positive equals a positive, but, a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative. So if we take all the negatives Christianity has done and all the positives and multiply them together, it is still a negative. To put this in more simple terms imagine a serial killer with 50 innocent victims. Should he be forgiven because he did some charity work on the weekends? The answer is of course no. Christianity is not a force for good in the world. The hatred found in Leviticus and the pedophilia dispersed in the places of worship are enough to see this on their own. Not to mention the other points I have raised. People are good and just enough already to need a bronze-age book dictating their lives. (1)http://www.perseus.tufts.edu... (2)Christie, C., Gauvreau, M. (2001). A Full-Orbed Christianity: The Protestant Churches and Social Welfare in Canada, 1900-1940 McGill-Queen\\'s Press - MQUP, Jan 19, 2001 pg 107', 'When I observe the horrors in the back catalog of Christianity, it seems fitting that the image chosen as their earthly symbol, is one of most abhorrent forms of bronze-age Middle Eastern execution. In order to fully understand the role Christianity plays in the world today we must first look back at the terrors conducted in its repugnant name. Here I will name but a few of the achievements of Christianity: The crusades, the inquisition, the persecution of the Jewish people, the forced conversion of indigenous peoples, the African slave trade and the deafening silence during Hitler\\'s Final Solution. A list of accomplishments, which perhaps, would not be towards the top of ones curriculum vitae. Now to look towards the modern day, the Christian church remains a patriarchal establishment. The injustice to women is institutional. That is half the world\"s population who are doomed to be listed with the livestock. On top of the patriarchy there is of course anti-homosexuality, these are people who are being punished by the church, not for what they believe, but for who they love and how they express it. This cannot be good for the world. Love is so desperately lacking in life, love needs dispensing not suppressing. Another unforgivable aspect of the modern day church is the idea that AIDS as a disease is bad, however, not as bad as condoms. Millions dead, for whom? And for what? It certainly wasn\\'t for any force of good. Finally in this opening statement I will briefly touch on the most reprehensible part of Christianity in recent times, the long-standing institutional child rape. I do not think I need to expand on the point of pedophilia and why it is wrong. A force for good? Well, unquestionably not a good that I would fight for. No one can argue Christianity doesn\\'t have some wonderful morals, however, these morals are not exclusive to Christianity, and the works of charity done by Christians are not exclusive to Christians. The force for good is already within human beings, Christianity, perhaps not intentionally, but undoubtedly persistently, distorts it.', 'I will be arguing against the premise. The debate will go as follows. 1) Acceptance 2) Opening statement 3) Rebuttal 4) Closing statement', \"Ultimately the question being asked is if Christianity is a force of good in the world. IS it a force for good, not HAS it been a force for good. And ultimately even when you look at it from two different angles, it's apparent that indeed our God is a God of love. He wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves. Thank you.\", \"While you are correct about the crusades and other battles fought over Christianity, remember that while the humans may not always make the right choices, the religion governing them wants them to. The bible itself is indeed a strong force for good, and there are countless major benefits from Christianity. The church is the single largest provider of healthcare and education in the world, especially in the poorest countries where it is needed most. Christianity also pioneered social work. The first American woman to ever be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize was Jane Addams. The church also co-founded the first settlement house in the US, hoping to bridge the gap between poor and rich. The London society for the prevention of cruelty to children, or the London SCCP, campaigning from the wider church, was the first force to stop cruelty towards children, and from them the first UK law about child neglect and cruelty was created. Churches were also the first orphanages, opening their arms in the Middle Ages to unwanted children that were left at the Churches' doorsteps. This practice ultimately started the orphanage movements we have today. I could go on for hours listing the countless things Christianity has done for the world.\", 'Hello, thanks for putting out the challenge. Shall we hear the opening argument against the matter?', \"My opponent hasn't responded to any arguments. I extend all arguments. xxhellogoodbyexx I had a great time debating with you. Thank you for making this debate possible.\", \"The excuse does not revolve on capacity to consume. It deals with the human values we believe are fundamental to mankind. We are more important. Selfish as it seems, a human's collective thinking would contradict. Would you seriously consider killing a man before killing a chicken? This is why it is legal to kill an animal for eating. It is not, however, legal for someone to kill a human, especially for cannibalism (crime against humanity). It is undebatable that human nature leads us to believe that we are more important than any other animal. Why so? That is irrelevant to the resolution. It is only used for comparison. On the other hand, with my opponent's logic a person should die in place for a chicken. That said, I would like to add that I believe cruel treatment of animals is wrong. However, my opponents alternative is clearly contradictory to most beliefs. If a couple of chickens have to die in order to create a cure for cancer, so be it. I extend all my arguments made in the previous round. I have voided all rebuttals and await any further argument in round 3.\", 'Hello. The reason my opponent votes negative on Animal Testing is because animals do not deserve the cruelties put upon them. However, my opponents alternative is flawed for the following reasons. 1. It is essential in scientific and technological advances. As long as pain and suffering for the animals is minimized, I believe that it is acceptable to use testing on animals as opposed to having humans go through the same process. That said, it is very impractical to have humans endure these tests. 2. It would prevent any harmful side-effects had the testing been done on humans. The ethics is questionable. However, it is widely believed that the value of a human is MUCH greater than the value on an animal. It is undebatable that we, as people, would rather have someone else do something. As long as everyone accepts this fact, there are no ethical dilemmas. In summary, I believe that animal testing is VERY desirable and the ethical issues are outweighed by the benefits of using them as opposed to human beings. My opponents argument is loose and the alternative is impractical and may cause danger to human beings.', 'no further arguments..... thank you opponent for your participation. I still believe there should be a better alternative to animal testing and hope we solve soon into the future.... thank you! Thank you, best regards!', \"Why is it so impractical for humans to endure this? what makes them so different than animals? why are animals more greater and more important than animals, they are larger and consume more? that i believe is no excuse. we basically already test the products ourselves. Would you look at a bottle of body lotion, body soap, makeup and say iam going to put it in my mouth..... probally not... so why would you force down someone else's throat. If you think its alright and just natural to do so..... we should shove you in cages and shove tubes down your throat, force foreign objects down your throat and beat you senslessly. And you still have the heart to say thats okay?\", 'Why should animals have to suffer for our society to make medicines and makeup for humans. just because they dont have a voice to speak, makes them an easy target to take advantage of for their own uses. Its very selfish and unnesscary. Why dont we make people get tested on these prodcuts, what makes animals the target for being abused in such unbelievable ways. What makes animals different then humans? every year 100 millon animals are killed just so your hair stays in place?', \"Sometimes I like to dress up in women's clothing and eat turkey.\", '1) I don\\'t think that a prom that you explain will not be taken seriously later in your argument will help the cause of improving DDO members\\' views on females. Moreover, the concepts of \"Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping?,\" \"getting laid,\" and \"dropping a baby eight months later\" don\\'t seem like very gender-equal principles. The opponent states, \"Prom on DDO isnt supposed to be as serious as the one on real life, its supposed to be a fun hook up game.\" This doesn\\'t really correspond with the actual concept of a prom. This is more like the parody of a prom, which is not addressed in the resolution or in the initial argument. Guys will hook up with guys, and then the anti-gay marriage people will be offended and violence will ensue. Let us remember that 33% of DDO is anti-gay marriage [1], so this would not be the most gay-friendly event. 2) Regardless of how they act, many DDO members are beyond high school (and prom) age. Take RoyLatham for example [2]; he is married and probably has no interest in finding a date for an online prom. This prom idea excludes many important members of the DDO community who are married or whose partners are not interested in joining them in a virtual prom. And I\\'m posing the idea that this would make younger DDO users more vulnerable to predatory attacks by pedophiles who lurk all over the internet, including DDO. 3) I don\\'t know if this prom thing would even catch on, so I wouldn\\'t emphasize the gossip argument too much. And if the event fails, then the gossip will simply be negative (i.e., how moronic imabench is for coming up with this concept.) 4) ...What? So basically it consists of baseless voting from anyone on DDO who chooses to vote? This has nothing to do with the traditional concept of Prom King and Prom Queen, which actually typically involves votes from people who actually know them. 5) Well, that really has little to do with the actual concept of \"prom,\" but all right, then. 6) \"Hook up\" with anonymous people on an online debate site? What would that even entail? Where would the gossip arise from, by the way? From what I see, this whole idea would be forum-based... ... So, uh, in conclusion... Um, in conclusion... Why the **** am I debating this? ... [1] http://www.debate.org... [2] http://www.debate.org...', '1) There is no indication that girls are not treated well by guys right now. And it is not plausible that a virtual prom would lead to a strong increase in conduct; in fact, I think trolling would spike. The anonymity offered by the internet allows for people to not take this \"prom\" thing as seriously as they would in real life. On the point that \"the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls,\" it will be likely that many guys will be left without prom dates and therefore be vengeful, leading to a number of prom-crashing attempts; hence, the opponent\\'s theory that there would be an upswing in conduct is nullified. 2) Many of the males on here have already completed high school, but for those that have not, it would be risky for them to attempt to contact \"prom dates\" on this site, which consists of many anonymous members whose true backgrounds are unknown to us. Having adolescent males staying in contact with people who state that they are males on this website is not a good idea. 3) The opponent hasn\\'t proven whether or not the gossip would benefit DDO or not. Moreover, the whole \"acid in the punch\" and \"getting laid\" stuff seems to be a little.... Uh, how would this prom even work? 4) What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen? It would most likely just be based on debates, because that\\'s how most of the people on here know each other... So what is the use of incorporating the \"prom\" concept in their names? 5) This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it. It is not germane to the resolution (whether or not DDO should have a prom.) --- 6) Feasibility: How would this happen? I kindly ask the opponent to define \"prom\" in a context that would suit what he is trying to argue.', \"DDO shouldn't have a prom. Let's see your arguments.\", '1) \"the concepts of \"Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping? ,\" \"getting laid,\" and \"dropping a baby eight months later\" don\\'t seem like very gender-equal principles. \"I can see why girls completely degrading a man for dropping a baby eight months later might not be gener equality, but that happens to women to so your argument is invalid\"This doesn\\'t really correspond with the actual concept of a prom.

Prom on DDO isnt going to involve actually meeting people in real life, it is only going to be on the forums, it will just be a community activity for people to gossip and chat about, and will be harmless. People ask people to Prom and thats about as serious as it will ever get, from there you simply announce who your prom date is and participate in all the prom games and gossip that comes with the event. Older people can stay out of it, People dont have to go, its all for fun.', '1) Respect towards women\"There is no indication that girls are not treated well by guys right now\"RoyalPaladin and Rogue both briefly left the website because of how sh*tty guys (one in particular who shall for the sake of this debate remain anonymous) treated them. Also look at the treatment that Gabbie222 got from guys on this site who trolled the hell out of her when she spammed a couple debates. Girls are treated poorly in some cases and a DDO prom might help them be respected more on DDO. \"The anonymity offered by the internet allows for people to not take this \"prom\" thing as seriously as they would in real life\"Prom on DDO isnt supposed to be as serious as the one on real life, its supposed to be a fun hook up game that everyone does for maybe a few days or so, then they announce who their prom \"date\" is, a couple of other Prom things are done and then thats the end of it. A DDO Prom would basically be a little populatiry stunt done once a year like Gender Change Week, Avatar Week, or something like that. DDO Prom is designed to be more like a 1 week fad then a serious thing. \"it will be likely that many guys will be left without prom dates and therefore be vengeful, leading to a number of prom-crashing attempts\"1) And wouldnt that be funny as sh*t?2) Guys can hook up with guys if they want......3) You wont get chastized very bad for not having a Prom Date on DDO......2) Guys need this\"Many of the males on here have already completed high school\"And many of them act like they are still in Middle School, and I proudly can say I am one of those people depending on what I am debating (See Poop has DNA Debate)\"Having adolescent males staying in contact with people who state that they are males on this website is not a good idea.\"Well im against online gay pornography rings too but the DDO Prom wouldnt be in real life it would just be on the forums where everyone posts who their date is and what they do during the prom and stuff like that.....3) The Gossip\"The opponent hasn\\'t proven whether or not the gossip would benefit DDO or not\"DDO sure lights up everytime somebody gossips about something. Look at any trial or any case where one person accuses another of cheating, votebombing, voting unfairly, yatta yatta yatta and people eat it up. This gossip though would be harmless since its just a bunch of people having fake hookups....4) Prom King + Queen\"What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen?\"It could be the cutest couple, the surprise couple, the weirdest couple, its a popularity contest and the winners are just chosen by voters who vote for any couple for any reason. 5) Prom Mafia\"This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it. It is not germane to the resolution\"DDO Prom would be 1/2 anouncing who is with who on one forum and then 1/2 fun prom action stuff in the game forum with other things sprinkled in. 6) How would it even work?Prom will be held on 1 week every year, and it would be the same week each time. In the time leading up to it people would \"hook up\" with others online and then when the time comes simply announce who their prom date would be. Then as the week progresses Prom activities and games are done as people discuss who hooked up with who, who got stood up, and gossip while a host of Prom games are held in the game forum which will be based loosely off of other mafia style games. At the end of the week a contest will be held to determine the Prom King and Queen, along with a few other awards for other things, and then after that Prom ends, the site goes back to normal, gossip dies down, and in the end everyone becomes a little more friendly with each other in this website that over time has already grown into its own warped definition of a community. The next year at the same time the same thing happens again and a few tweaks are made to fix problems seen last year, etc etcThat is how Prom would work on DDO :)', 'Very Well then, reasons that DDO should have a Prom 1) It will make everyone more sociable and appreciative towards the females on DDO. It is a well known fact that the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls on here (at a rate of 2:1). If DDO had a prom then guys on DDO would in theory become more sociable and act more gentlemen-like towards women on DDO. Such a spike in conduct here on DDO among its members would also be welcomed to offset the usual amount of d*ckish behavior one normally sees between members in the forums and debates. 2) Guys need this Lets face it, people who spend a disproportionate amount of time on DDO most likely do not have as much luck with the ladies as they would like. A prom on DDO though allows those men to exercise their age old pickup lines, learn how to talk to women, and learn how to get the courage to ask a girl to prom, something that could benefit them later in life when their actual high school Prom comes around. 3) The gossip This is the biggest part about why there should be a prom in my opinion.... All the gossip that would be started once it was realized who showed up with the prom to who, it would be awesome! Does inferno get a date? Who is lucky enough to show up with Danielle as a date? Who does Royalpaladin choose to go with? If Jimtimmy gets a prom date then HOW THE HELL did he pull that off? Who was lucky enough to show up with Rogue or Mirza? Who will Thaddeus and FREEDO ask to Prom? Who will Innomen go to Prom with? Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping? Does somebody have a prom-night-dumpster-baby? Who tries to put acid in the punch? Who wakes up the next morning with a guy she doesnt know? Who gets laid that very night? Who drops a baby 8 months later? The gossip it would cause would diffuse all of the usual feuds we see going on in the forums, allow everyone to cool off, and have a bit of fun just gossiping over stuff. 4) Prom King and Queen This would be the biggest election on DDO next to the presidential election of DDO, Prom King and Queen would hold their title for an entire year (longer than the president would hold his) So if prom were to be held on DDO then a great honor would be given to the winning couple, and a tradition could form out of it, giving DDO some swagger and class. 5) Prom Mafia Yes you heard me right, Prom mafia. A game where everyone makes strategic moves against one another at Prom for personal reasons. During such a game one may \"accidentally\" spill their drink on someone they dont like, change the song midway through the dance, hit on somebody else\\'s prom date in an effort to try to catch them all (Pokemon!), or even to start dropping it like its hot and showing off some wicked dance moves. Such a thing would make Prom way more fun both for those who socialize on here and for those really into the gaming culture here on DDO.

Surprise! We sent over 3rd and 4th rate players to play against foreigners. The results were a joke. Here are some highlights: America 77-0 over South Korea and 33-7 over Germany. http://wc2007.info... It's no wonder my opponent has not heard about it. It sucks. The games are blowouts, not exiting, and quite frankly no one cares. There just isn't enough demand for American football when soccer is so popular over the world; it's embedded and people's culture and serves are a symbol of a nation's pride. It's for the same reasons soccer has failed in America that football fails over seas. There is no reason for it when other nations have soccer and we have football.

The only exception is media perception in the US is that other countries don't want to play, but that's not a reason that Football shouldn't have a world cup. The Current World Cups have been successful, and the Junior world cup currently be held in Dayton, Ohio is having huge success. Vote Pro.

For the sake of debate, we should be debating if this would cup \\'should\\' exist, or the con would say that its useless. My oppenents, and everyone\\'s for that matter, is that no other countries beside the US would be interested in playing, however (http://www.ifaf.info...), \"American football is a fascinating sport and its popularity has grown in more than 50 countries on six continents. American football began in the United States, but the sport has generated fans in other countries as diverse as Australia, South Korea and Finland.\" Football ball is being played all over the world, by all kinds of people, in all kinds of countries. A championship to highlight each countries skills wouldn\\'t be bad, it would be great because the game would gain exposure. The whole problem we have in America is that we assume that noone else plays this game so we fear even trying to expose it. IF we just expose the game more and more people will play it. My opponents other argument revolved around saying that, even though we have a world cup it is not \\'exiciting\\' enough. Well, ok, first of all you didn\\'t look at all the score: The Championship game saw the US winning in double overtime against Japan 23-20 (http://wc2007.info...), and all of the games except the prelims involving Japan and the US (Where they both won there two prelims games handily) the other games remained very competive, especially the 3rd/4th place game and the 5th/6th place game which was 7-0 and 3-0 respectivly. Anyway, Americans don\\'t care if the game is close, hell they encourage a blow out, as long as its for the Red, White, and Blue. Look at the Olympics, the \\'Reedem Team\\' (Named so because the US actually lost a basketball game in the Olympics and World Championships and didn\\'t walk away with a gold) walk away from Bejing with an 8-0 record, a gold medal, and a 21.5+ Scoring Margin. No game was close, even against Spain and Argentina (Ranked the highest in the world) the US still won by 11 and 20 points respectivly. After not being tested in the Olympics, the Redeem Team returned home as hereos for restoring honor to the US by winning their sport. A football World Cup would be no different, at least not for a long time. If IFAF would just simply market they\\'re product then people all across the US would openly watch and watch enthusiastically. No in the heat of June/July is going to turn away from Team USA playing a football game no matter how lopsided it is because 1) Its they\\'re country 2) They haven\\'t seen anthing but a few spring football games in six months. Once we convince Americans, I don\\'t think we\\'ll have to do to much to convince the rest of the world http://en.wikipedia.org...) For the \"2007 [World Cup] the total number of teams in the competition exceeded 20 countries\" including qualifications. If you already have 20 countries activly participating, and 50 countries showing interest in the sport, the competion is only sure to grow. They\\'re is plenty of competition out their for the US, we just have to be willing to accept it. Quiet Simply, all America has to do is embrace the World Cup that already exists and then the Sport will propel into a new era of international football. With the biggest proponent of Football behind it, the World Cup would be able to expand and grow just like soccer has untill it truely an honorable international championship.', \"The world is changing. With faster communication, satellite television, and air travel. Any one anywhere can communicate with people all over the world about sports, watch sporting events from all over the world, and even fly to any sporting event anywhere in the world. The ultimate winner from this has been the World Cup of Soccer (To simplify this debate I will use Soccer for the international game of Futball and Football for the American game of football.) What happens there? Countries send teams from all over the world, that spend the two leading up years trying to qualify, to the world's biggest stage, with the game's biggest stars, competing in a tournament with team as well as national pride on the line. FIFA (The international soccer organization) rakes in the money on their ideal invention, Qualify countries rake in money and international exposure and pride for winning. The world stands still and the entire sports world turns to one event that is seen all over the world. In America, we have long dis-enfranchised soccer, we set out to make a new and better sport: We call it football. And to America's credit, we have certainly embraced the sport. Developing it to a level of local pride and power that no use leagues or even our own US national teams can compete with: The NFL. The world stands still for soccer, America football. The problem with the American dream to create a sport to compete with soccer is that they actually have to compete with it not hide in their own corner and pout. Football, like soccer, has to become an international sport, contended on a world level, that does not limit its to the confines of the US. The will to play the sport is constently expanding, the sport itself is perhaps even expanding faster then American perception. The fear is that if we let other people play our sport, they might get better at it then us. Though the US may not be able to keep its dominance in the sport forever, like in Basketball, a little competition isn't that bad is it? What I'm proposing is a World Cup, or International competition of Football, where teams from around the world send national teams to advance the game to its highest level. The Format of the Cup would depend on the number of teams participating, obviously if to many want to participate then the issue would arise for regional qualifying and such, but the simple truth remains the need exists. The goal and orginal purpose of Football was to contend with soccer, and the only way to do that is to take the competition inter-national. The main American resent is that no one else plays, so why bother? If you build it, they will come. http://pointme.to... Illustrates numerous international Football sites and leagues (though some outdated) which Play Football. The obvious initial entries would be the United States, Canada, Mexico, Great Britian, Germany, Japan, and China. Several other European countries show interest, and small countries would probally jump in at least at first just to fill numbers and get international exposure. Yes, it is true the competition could get lopsided if NFL plays all go in on the side of the US, but playing gap would thin out and competition would increase. Even international Soccer competition outside of the upper crust is extremely titled to the bigger teams who's talent alone allow them to crush their opponents. Though constents blow outs wouldn't be fun, some games would be close. If not necessarily the US's games, the other competition would be on the same field. International Basketball has grown even with the US as a dominating leader in the sport really unbeaten when they try, however through time and exposure of the game, the sport has been able to grow in ways previously unimaginable. http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com... The sportsbusiness Journal reports the NFL in 9 Billion dollars in debt, that was over a year ago so no it probally a lot more. The NFL despite its huge popularity and selling out its games is running a defecit due to the few amount of games played and the large stadiums they build and then allow to sit empty most of the year. Cities could bid on having the world cup of football and thus bring in money, and if the NFL was smart they could create the world cup and thus add to their revenues with very little actual cost out put because the Stadiums are already built so just play in one of them. The World Cup could even be played in the Spring/Summer to give football fans, going through off-season withdrawl, the abiality to see new live football action with some of their favorite stars. The enjoyment of the Nation watching the redeem team this year capture the gold in Beijing could be seen on a football field. The Cup could be stage ever 2 or four years, but probally 2 since they won't add it as an Olympic sport. Having international games in the off-season would allow fans to get tastes football all year round, and also promote international fans with a taste of the NFL drawing in more viewers and potential markets for the NFL to dive into. A Football World Cup would be very profitable to anyone who hosted, I mean if Colleges can bring in 60,000 for their spring games (which are inter-squad), I think a little real competition would go over with the public quiet well. The Purpuse of football was to compete with the world, and untill they do that its purpose will not be achieved.\", 'Challenge Accepted!', 'I have no response for my opponents argument. points to con for his outstanding rebuttal.', \"My opponent… “The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people's rights.” Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women). You stated that you were pro sex-education and the main point of sex education is abstinence and sexual awareness so what is expected of the sexual education teacher to teach? Sex is just fine no matter what age? Only protected sex is okay? Abstinence is the best way of preventing pregnancy unless you feel differently? The main reason society looks down on or even rejects promiscuity is because many are taught abstinence from a young age and they are taught abstinence from a young age to help women from being thrown into a situation they never planned to be in. “Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society.” Again, a big point teachers make in sexual health classes is the fact abstinence is the best choice until marriage. If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. “Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girl’s appearance or behavior.” The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. My arguments First of all I would like to clarify that promiscuity in both males and females is wrong but for the sake of this debate I will argue how and why it is wrong in females. Unexpected Pregnancy One major social issue our society deals with is abortion. While some are pro-life and some are pro-choice I think it is clear we can all agree that abortion should be at least the last resort. The most effective way to prevent abortions is not getting pregnant and the most effective way to not get pregnant is abstinence. Effects of Unexpected Pregnancy The majority of the women who get pregnant before they are married will not end up getting married. This of course leads a huge burden on the mother having to deal with. According to the U.S Census Bureau %27.3 of single parents live in poverty. Also, the effects of children growing up without a parent can be drastic… Drinking problems.Teenagers living in single-parent households are more likely to abuse alcohol and at an earlier age compared to children reared in two-parent households Suicidal Tendencies.In a study of 146 adolescent friends of 26 adolescent suicide victims, teens living in single-parent families are not only more likely to commit suicide but also more likely to suffer from psychological disorders, when compared to teens living in intact families. Disturbing news:Children of never-married mothers are more than twice as likely to have been treated for an emotional or behavioral problem. Expelled:Nationally, 15.3 percent of children living with a never-married mother and 10.7 percent of children living with a divorced mother have been expelled or suspended from school, compared to only 4.4 percent of children living with both biological parents. College odds:Children from disrupted families are 20 percent more unlikely to attend college than kids from intact, two-parent families. Criminal Behavior:The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later criminal behavior. In the case of a teenage mother, the absence of a father also increases the risk of harshness from the mother.Seventy-two percent of adolescent murderers grew up without fathers. Sixty percent of America's rapists grew up the same way. As you can see promiscuity can lead to unwanted pregnancy which leads on to abortions and fatherless kids which carries out to more drastic measures such as the statistics mentioned above. Spread of STD’s Another result from promiscuity is the spread of STD’s. Often enough promiscuous women having unprotected sex will contract an STD. The woman could have it without knowing which is putting potential future partners at risk. Sad but true... A woman who is sexually promiscuous is more likely to be raped then a woman who is not. I am not saying that all rape victims are promiscuous or victim blaming in any way but a woman who dresses sexually provocative is more likely to be targeted by a rapist. Although it is not the victims fault in any way, women should make sure to be away and use protective measures to reduce the chance of falling victim to predators. I have proved that promiscuity leads to terrible things such as unexpected pregnancy, STD’s, and even rape. It is obvious that in today’s society men and women are held at double standards but I feel it is fair to say promiscuity is harmful regardless of your gender. I look forward to my opponents rebuttal :) http://www.policymic.com... http://www.photius.com...\", \"My proposed debate is based on the social paradigm that women shouldn't indulge in casual or frecuent sex, and those who do be frowned upon by society. I will be arguing CON, which means I will defend women having the right to practice sex freely without being discriminated or condenmed.\", 'My opponent stated:\"Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women).

If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. \"I believe there has been a misunderstanding regarding the terminology. The point of sex-education is not abstinence. The point of sex education is to reduce risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, and equip individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexual activity. What my opponent is referring to is called abstinence-only sexual education, an obsolete approach that focuses solely on abstinence as a tool to fight unhealthy sex practices. What I am proposing is called comprehensive sex education, which also adds the options of contraceptives, safe sex and non vaginal sex practices. Of course, at first glance, abstinence seems like the better choice, for it is a 100% certain way to avoid pregnancy and STD\\'s. Nevertheless, it has been proven to be very inefficient as an approach to sex education: Abstinence-only sex education has been found to be ineffective in decreasing the HIV risk in the developed world. [1] Abstinence-only sex education has also been found to increase unplanned pregnancy. [2] The concept of no premarital sex is evidently flawed, for it completely neglects the issues for individuals to whom marriage is not valued or desired, not to mention those for whom it\\'s not allowed (specifically LGBT). It distorts information, revealing only the failure rates of contraceptives and not their high success rates and benefits. [3] The whole approach is focused on a compulsory dogma of chastity, rather than an informed decision taking methodology, unsuitable with our free thinking society. Why should abstinence be regarded as the one and only way to prevent sex related problems? Why not tell teenagers that the average condom has a 98% success rate when used correctly, or that the contraceptive pill has a 99.7% success rate? [4] Why should they be discouraged from practicing non vaginal sexual activities such as anal sex, mutual masturbation or oral sex? If there are efficient ways to practice sex with relative safety, the social paradigm is pointless. The truth is that \"slut shaming\" is not a matter of public health as much as it is a matter of sexism and socio-religious principle. My opponent claims:\"The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. \"My case is not against prevention. It all depends on how the advise is presented. Of course women should not get in strangers\\' cars or accept beverages handed to them by unknowns. We must accept the fact that sick individuals exist, and they should be handled as the threat they are. We must raise consciousness the same way we would advert a kid against a pedophile. What I find offensive is when females are told they shouldn\\'t dress in a particular way, or that they should build up an image of chastity for themselves in order to reduce the risk of rape. This is almost like endorsing the animalistic instincts of some degenerates, treating them as poor souls tempted by desire instead of the degenerate criminals they are. As to my opponent\\'s arguments, they all derive from pregnancy and STD\\'s, let us go deeper: Undesired Pregnancy. I share my opponent\\'s opinion on the disadvantages of this issue. However, I don\\'t see how it\\'s a valid reason to indulge in hatred and discrimination of promiscuous women. As it\\'s already been discussed, there are ways to live an active safe life and avoid pregnancy. It is absurd to condemn someone over the mere possibility of pregnancy. Why should a girl who has successfully avoided pregnancy by the correct use of contraceptives be victim of bigotry in the hands of society? It is not fair. Similarly, there are women who accept the responsibility of their mistakes, and become caring and loving mothers. These brave women shouldn\\'t fall under the judgemental eye of society either. A group can never, ever be judged based on the behavior of some of its individuals, this means all promiscuous females should not be judged on the behalf of their irresponsible peers. So, instead of judging promiscuity, society should put the pressure over irresponsibility. In other words, as long as the woman is not causing the social damages of giving birth to an unwanted child and neglecting him or her, she has no reason to be criticised. Sexually Transmitted Diseases. This is even less of a reason to endorse \"slut shaming\". Again, people who are promiscuous but have taken measures to remain clean have no reason to be frowned upon. Assuming people received the appropriate sex education my case is arguing for, there should be no doubts concerning the risks of sexual acts. If one party decides to engage in a sex act with another party, he or she does it in full understanding of the risk that implies getting infected. Contrarily, if a person unknowingly contracts a disease it is not a problem of promiscuity but of sexual ignorance. Finally, I will address the portion of the debate where my opponent argues promiscuity is a cause of rape, and should therefore be rejected. Let me reduce this un-cited argument with an example. It is known that middle and high class citizens are more likely to be targeted by kidnappers. Do we ask them to stop earning money? Do we judge them for having large amounts of money? No, it would be illogical, they make money because they obtain pleasure from it. The same applies to our issue: women should be careful, the same way affluent individuals take safety measures to prevent kidnapping, but they should not be told to give up an active sex life just to prevent rape. Moreover, this debate is not about promiscuity being right or wrong, or about the pros and cons of abstinence versus promiscuity. This debate is about women having a right to practice sex freely, without being discriminated. It needs to be understood that the mere fact of having frequent and casual sex has no immoral value on its own. It\\'s an issue of the tolerance and acceptance (not necessarily approval) that these women deserve. Sources:[1] Underhill, K; Operario, D, Montgomery, P (2007 Oct 17). Operario, Don. ed. \"Abstinence-only programs for HIVinfection prevention in high-income countries\"[2] Kohler, Pamela; Lafferty, William (2008 Apr). \"Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy\". Journal of Adolescent Health[3] Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006[4] \"Planned Parenthood IUD Birth Control\" - Mirena IUD', 'Thank you for accepting my challenge, I hope it\\'s an enlightening debate.To clarify what i am debating against, I will introduce an unofficial but popular term that describes my case perfectly: \"Slut shaming\" is defined as the act of making a woman feel guilty or inferior for engaging in sexual behaviors that violate traditional expectations. [1] Observe:In its declaration of sexual rights, the World Health Organization (the public health branch of the United Nations) states:Sexual rights embrace human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other consensus documents. These include the right of all persons, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, to:the highest attainable standard of health in relation to sexuality, including access to sexual and reproductive health care services;seek, receive and impart information in relation to sexuality;sexuality education;respect for bodily integrity;choice of partner;decide to be sexually active or not;consensual sexual relations;consensual marriage;decide whether or not, and when to have children; andpursue a satisfying, safe and pleasurable sexual life. [2].Let us examine some particular points, like \"right to decide to be sexually active or not\", \"right to consensual sexual relations\", and the \"right to pursue a satisfying safe and pleasurable sexual life\". The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people\\'s rights. This means that if a woman finds it sexually satifying and pleasurable to lead a promiscous life style, she should be allowed to do so without any form of discrimination or social disproval, for she is only excerting the sexual rights mentioned above.Please note that I am not advocating for a society that encourages promiscuity, less one that promotes unprotected sex or other unsafe sexual practices. I am in favor of sex education (in fact, the delcaration states that as a right). My debate only rises from the common conception that a promiscuity in women is something rejectable and that deserves social criticism (whereas promiscuity in men is usually admired and even encouraged.) Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society. Why should a woman who choses to have sex automatically be relegated to a lower social category? Why should sexually active men prefer virgins over sexually active women? It is unfair, and should not be accepted under any circumstance.This phenomenum causes many social illnesses, like rape culture, victim blaming, sexual bullying and objectification, based on the belief that a woman who choses to live an active sex life is not worthy of respect, and just represents a source of pleasure for men. Not only are women judged on their sex lives, but also on the clothes they wear, the places they visit, or the partners they engage with. This constitutes an essential violation of human rights, for no person should be discrimintaed on the basis of gender [3]. Women should be allowed to chose how they dress, what places to visit and how many times they have sex without being frowned upon or objectified. Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girls appearence or behavior. Women should not be told to dress conservative in order to \"get respect\", respect should be inherent, and men should be expected to respect any woman, regardless of her looks.Sources:[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://www.un.org...[3] http://www.upsettingrapeculture.com...', \"What you're arguing about is completely off what the title suggests 'Both Christianity and Islam encourage excessive cruelty to animals' means that the ideology that the person follows encourages the follower to torture animals, and be excessively cruel towards them. Thus far, all you've proven is how many farms are owned by Christians / Muslims, and statistics shown about how much meat is consumed by people who follow Christianity / Islam. You haven't proven how each ideology promotes excessive amounts of cruelty to animals, you've only shown how much meat is eaten and how many farms are owned by people who follow each religion. There has been no evidence about the Bible or the Quran, no criticism of the ideology, and nothing about excessive cruelty. You've only criticized the people, of the religion and not the religion itself. Needless to say, your statements have only been promoting veganism, and only proves about the excessive amount of meat eaten, which is an entirely different topic from this, and not a single word about how each religion promotes animal cruelty. Christians work in factories + Factories are cruel to animals = Christianity promotes cruelty. This is your logic and reasoning behind it as far as I can tell, which only adresses the people, but not the ideology. You also mentioned how the factory farming industry is cruel. Yet, this doesn't equate at all to how Christianity or Islam promotes excessive cruelty towards animals, and have strayed completely off topic. You said that referring to the text for each religion would result in bias. That means that you haven't argued the topic AT ALL. For the part about turning Christians into vegetarians / vegans, you're doing nothing more than forcing your own ideals onto other people, which obviously doesn't work, and losing your faith over such a thing. Like how people complain about Christians shoving Christianity down their throats, you have been doing the same with veganism.

Thanks for debating.\", \"I fully know what you are trying to say, that to this day, christians and muslims are putting animal sacrifices into practice though it has been abolished for centuries. This may be the case for Islam, but what about Christianity? In your example, you didn't give any direct quotes from the bible, or any real life cases about the topic related to Christianity. The bible doesn't encourage EXCESSIVE cruelty to animals, it says to end them quickly. And animal sacrifices for Christianity have been long put out of practice, by the bible itself. And your comment on looking at the actions of people rather than the belief. Since in the title you are criticizing the ideology (christian / Islam) rather than the people (christian / muslim), the statement made about looking at the people's actions is irrelevant, considering this is a conversation about an ideology, rather than the people. By the looks of what your statement said, a more fitting title would be 'Muslims encourage excessive cruelty towards animals'.\", 'Though I am extremely anti - Islam (due to the fact they encourage violence to all non believers rather than just non - innocent people), I can\\'t find evidence relating to how they are cruel to animals.

So for both religions (Keep in mind im anti islam), the mindless cruelty towards animals is not justified by either holy book. However, if you it is taken into context about killing an animal just for a sacrifice, I get where you\\'re coming from.', '\"or any real life cases about the topic related to Christianity.\" I\\'ve talked about factory farming in r1. It is well known that Christianity is around 70% in the USA and factory farming is rampant the USA. [3]99% of animals are raised on factory farms in the USA. [4] The majority of USA citizens are Christian. 99% of animals raised in the USA are from factory farms. Factory farming is infamous for its terrible cruelty. Therefore there is a strong positive relationship between Christianity and factory farming. I can only come to the conclusion that Christianity causes animal cruelty. As for other religions, this may also be true, but is a red herring. If religion x causes cruelty to animals, this won\\'t change the fact that Christianity causes cruelty to animals. As for judging a religion by its religious texts, I\\'ve already gone over this in this debate any many others. Religious texts have many contradictory passages. Since people are self motivated they often select the passage that benefits them the most, using conformation bias to ignore the contradictory passage. \"Gee, God says animals don\\'t have souls, gave us souls, gave us dominion over animals, Jesus ate fish, and Jesus said it was moral to eat meat.\" Completely overlooking the anti-cruelty passages. If I had to point to one event that turned me from a Christian to an agnostic it is this.Nevermind that the body is a temple of the holy spirit. That if you defile your body God will destroy you. Oh no, Jesus ate one fish so then we can rationalize every single misdeed we perform to animals based upon this. I just found it was impossible to convince Christians to turn vegetarian. I honestly lost my faith arguing vegan issues with Christians on this debate site.

You can make point A and then complete opposite from a different passage in the same religious texts. Which then leads to confirmation bias. A reader will then pick which side of the topic to follow based upon his/her person agenda and bias. Therefore, we must judge how a religion treats animals based upon the actions of its followers. As already seen in r1, Christians an Muslims tend to treat animals horribly. Note this same train of thought could be made for violence. That religion x states in part A of its religious texts peace and part B war. That means a person following the religion will pick whatever benefits him/her the most. Finally, to really determine how a religion treats animals, we must compare the actions of followers of various religions. That way we can see how they stack up. Overall, Christianity and Islam treat animals much worse than Hinduism and Buddhism. Also, note many animal rights activist gravitate towards atheism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Which also shows that these religions have more respect for animals. Thanks for debating.', 'More and more I am seeing little use for either of these religions in modern day. Perhaps in a past era these ideas were necessary to survive. Yet, with no evidence of God I am beginning to question a religion who claims a supreme being created these morals, yet is very cruel to animals. I think it is well known about the Christian capitalistic factory farms. The old testament Kosher slaughtering of animals. That Christians can morally use animals for food, clothing, and experimentation. Yet, what about the newcomer to the western world? Is Islam any better? No, in many ways Islam is just as bad if not worse. I. Ritual slaughter\"Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law.

Discrimination against dogs. \"Muslim countries, in particular, are rife with unimaginable cruelty toward animals. Walid Shoebat has been chronicling horrific cases of Muslim animal abuse. Below are two recent examples:#1: In Iran, government gets rid of stray dogs by injecting them with acid. Acid is chosen because it is the least expensive poison, but the method is cruel because it consigns the dog to a painful and slow death, as the acid slowly corrodes the dog’s guts.\" [2]This is heart breaking for anyone who loves animals.

If we followed your suggestion on forgoing the extra rounds, the opponent would get to give a response, but for what purpose? The debate is over.

Thus, a person cannot be voted for unfairly if the opponent has encountered some emergency.\", 'But I would argue it does. If the supernatural is either impossible or meaningless, it cannot exist. If it is impossible then it is impossible. But what does it mean to say \"the supernatural exists\" if one accepts it\\'s meaningless? It means nothing. Thus as it means nothing the supernatural lacks any possibility of being true. Yes we have limits on our knowledge, but one would need unlimited knowledge to make an appeal to magic when confronted by seemingly inexplicable events. It is an argument stemming from our lack of knowledge. A reversal of the theist claim that I would need to be omniscient to rule out the supernatural.', 'Thank you for your response. If supernaturalism is only meaningful in the context of negating natural causes and it is impossible for us to know that natural causes have been negated. It follows that supernaturalism is impossible and therefore false. A theist could take the defence of stating that the supernatural is meaningless and therefore not even false, but whilst that may be open to the theist position it hardly seems to improve it. Apologies if that was not clear from the premises. Is it clear now or do you believe I have missed a step here? P1 is probably the premise to attack.', 'To rule in the supernatural, we need a transcendent knowledge base precisely because our knowledge is limited to begin with. And since supernatural effects can only be deduced if one has no limits of knowledge, then naturalism is absolute. We can express both lines of evidence in this way: P1) Supernaturalism is only meaningful in that it is a negation of material causes. P2) Negation of material causes would only be possible if one had no limit of knowledge. P3) Human knowledge is limited. C1) Supernaturalism is impossible. (from P1, P2 and P3) C2) Naturalism is an absolute. (from C1) P1) through P2) Human knowledge is limited. Naturalism and naturalistic causes are assumed in each and every example of human experience, through a process of induction and an appeal to the simplest possible explanation. Supernatural explanations are always more complex as they invoke mysterious, un-knowable, mystical agents. There is a 3 step approach we can consider: Step 1) if we see a potentially supernatural event we first question of the validity of the observation, equipment, method and approach. If this completely rules out a natural explanation we go to step 2) Step 2) we question as to whether a new area of science has opened up and look to establish repeatable observations, and assess them through an explanatory natural framework. If we can rule out this possibility we go to step 3) Step 3) we are left in a meaningless position because of we can only rule in a supernatural explanation, anything could be happening to our sense and reasoning and there is no way to determine truth To overturn this and rule in the supernatural, we need a transcendent knowledge base precisely because our knowledge is limited to begin with. And since supernatural effects can only be deduced if one has no limits of knowledge, then naturalism is absolute. We can express both lines of evidence in this way: P1) Supernaturalism is only meaningful in that it is a negation of material causes.

You appear to contradict yourself in stating: R1) \"Well, congratulations on proving it is not meaningful. However, you didn\\'t prove it was impossible...[snip]...\"; then R4) \"...[snip]...All we proved is that super-naturalism isn\\'t a definitive cause. That doesn\\'t show it\\'s meaningless...[snip]...\" To summarise the debate, I have tried to argue that the Supertnatural is impossible - because it is not possible for humans to ever know whether it applies. Humans are obliged to argue for naturalism as an absolute. The challenge presented in R1 - R3 was that one could argue that the argument only concludes the supernaturalism is meaningless, but still possible. I have to conclude that if the supernatural is meaningless, then in a sense it is in a worse position of being \\'not even possible\\'. Thanks again for the exchange.', 'Yes of course I see your point. But I struggle to make sense out of your analysis of this. Impossibility would presuppose a zero chance of being possible. Being possible would presuppose a likelihood. A likelihood would presuppose there being something with attributes to be likely. But, meaninglessness entails that the attributes of something are without meaning, they/it mean nothing. If something means nothing it has no attributes that make it ikely in the first place, if it has no likelihood it has no possibility, and is therefore impossible. I suppose a simpler rejoinder is what does it mean to say \"the supernatural is meaningless, but still possible\"?', 'Still, this did not rule out the possibility of supernatural existence. It just showed it was not possible to prove definitely. You said it yourself. We have limits to our knowledge. We can not rule out anything as impossible. We can say on is more likely, but not impossible.', \"Well, congratulations on proving it is not meaningful. However, you didn't prove it was impossible. Just we have no way to detect it. You did not affirm the resolution.\", \"I thought that you meant meaningless as in it is impossible to prove, not that it is impossible. All Pro has done is prove that it is impossible to know if a cause was supernatural. How that translates into supernaturalism being impossible is a mystery. In fact, Pro's own reasoning is his own downfall. Since we don't know the cause, we can't rule out supernaturalism. Somehow, we are obliged to still say that naturalism has to be the answer. It may be the likely answer, but without proof either way, it remains a 50-50 chance.\", \"Wait, I think we have a confusion. All we proved is that super-naturalism isn't a definitive cause. That doesn't show it's meaningless. It is in the sense that it is an unproven answer, but not that it serves no purpose.\", \"Precisely since it stems from our ignorance is why it can't be disproven. If this debate was if I it was impossible that I am holding up four fingers, then you would lose. You need to prove 100% that it is impossible. You have yet to show that it is impossible. Meaningfulness has nothing to do with this debate.\", 'My opponent has made no arguments. As Instigator and Pro he has the burden of proof. I have given six well-documented reasons why the legislation is not justified. The resolution therefore fails.', 'My opponent made no case and no rebuttal. The resolution is negated.', 'Pro picked a good topic, because cap and trade legislation is said to be next on Obama\\'s agenda. It\\'s a shame that Pro had nothing to say about the subject. Pro failed to define \"justification\" or to offer any proof that the legislation passed by the House meets any standard of justification. I will assume that \"justified\" means having \"having benefits outweighing its costs.\" 1. The theory of global warming crisis is at this point proved largely invalid, so there is no climate justification. CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, so that increased CO2 causes some global warming. The physics of carbon dioxide are such that doubling the present amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would produce about 1.5 degrees of temperature rise. That\\'s comparable to past prosperous warm periods like the Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was named for its greenery, and the Holocene Optimum, about 6000 years ago when civilizations rose in the Middle East. Global warming crisis theorists claim secondary effects in the atmosphere multiply the CO2 effect to crisis proportions, causing not just 1.5 degrees of warming, but 4.5 degrees of warming or more. The claim was based upon the warming that occurred from 1970 to 1995. Crisis theorists claimed that there was nothing else going on affecting climate: no solar effects, no volcanoes, no ocean cycles ... nothing except the rise in CO2. Therefore, they argued, there must be a multiplying effect for the CO2. The disproof is that even the UN now admits that there has been no global warming for the past 15 years, yet CO2 has continued to increase. If there is nothing else going on, as crisis theorists continue to claim, why have the predictions failed? Clearly there *is* something going on that is at least as important as CO2 effects. In fact, it is probably a combination of several factors such as multiple ocean cycles adding, a lack of volcanic activity (that causes cooling), and lower cosmic ray activity (that provides cloud seeding). In addition, analysis of \"natural experiments\" where CO2 has increased locally shows that the effects of CO2 are as the physics predicts, and are not multiplied. http://www.junkscience.com... Also see the book \"Chill\" by Peter Taylor for a discussion of the recent science. 2. Let\\'s assume for debate purposes that there is a CO2 crisis, and also that the legislation will work exactly as proposed, an extremely unlikely outcome. Even under those assumptions, computer models developed by the Government for the purpose of justifying the legislation show that the reduction in temperature rise would be only 0.05 C. http://gwswindle.blogspot.com... It is in the realm of a symbolic act to appease climate gods. If one believes in climate crisis, the right approach to fixing the problem lies in climate engineering. Climate engineering solutions could provide and actual cure, and do not pose all the international challenges and disastrous consequences posed by cap and trade. http://www.newscientist.com... 3. Cap and trade is not justified because it formalizes a system of payoffs. The system takes money from people who need to heat and cool their homes and from industries that provide jobs and gives it to a vast enforcement bureaucracy, to politicians who use it to dispense favors, and to middlemen who make a fortune trading the credits. Politicians control who suffers and who gets the riches. It has been tried in Europe, with widespread corruption the result. http://online.wsj.com... The system makes the middlemen trading credits rich. It the US, a prime trading beneficiary would be General Electric. http://thecommonconservative.com... GE has given huge support the Obama and the Democrats. They will be paid off handsomely for their support. The corruption is inherent. \"The cap-and-trade system being touted on Capitol Hill would create a multibillion-dollar playground that would, once again, create a group of wealthy traders benefiting at the expense of millions of average families—middle to low-income households that would end up paying more for food, energy, and almost everything else they buy.\" http://www.usnews.com... 4. Cap-and-trade will have an insignificant effect on global CO2 emissions. Europe has had both cap and trade and subscription to the Kyoto Protocol. The US has neither, but the US emission history is better. \"In recent years, despite all efforts following the Kyoto Summit, CO2 emissions have been rising more steeply in Europe than in the U.S.A. Like it or not, those are the hard facts.\" http://www.leonardo-energy.org... 5. Cap-and-trade causes industry to shift out of the developed world into the lesser developed countries, so even the tiny reductions in CO2 promised will not be achieved. In Europe, a third of their CO2 emission are transferred out. http://www.theecologist.org... In the US, California has its own green energy initiatives that dramatically increased energy costs. The result so far is that half the industry has moved out of the state. Nationwide cap and trade legislation would punish energy-intensive heavy industry in America, moving it China, India, and other countries that refuse to destroy their economies with exorbitant energy prices. http://hotair.com... \"According to an analysis of climate legislation performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the cap-and-trade system favored by President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats could potentially damage the U.S. manufacturing sector and force jobs to move overseas. ... s the EPA states: \"A cap-and-trade policy increases the price of energy-intensive goods. The majority of this price increase is ultimately passed onto consumers. … [L]ower income households are disproportionately affected by a GHG (Green House Gas) cap-and-trade policy because they spend a higher fraction of their incomes on energy-intensive goods.\"\" http://www.cnsnews.com... 6. In an odd twist, cap and trade may actual increase CO2 emissions, by making conversion to natural gas uneconomic. Improvements in technology have made supplies of natural gas cheaper and more abundant. Gas burns producing less CO2 than coal, so initially it seems that cap and trade would benefit the gas industry. However, to win approval in coal producing states, Democrats included special dispensations for the coal states. (It\\'s like the Pope giving out indulgences in the Middle Ages.) In a free market for energy, cheaper natural gas would displace coal over time, reducing CO2 emissions. But under the proposed legislation, carbon credits go to coal and not to natural gas, keeping coal viable where is would ordinarily be displaced. Cap and trade is unjustified because it would have no significant effect on global warming and might even increase it; it will dramatically increase energy costs to consumers for the benefit of the politically favored, and it will drive jobs and industry other countries. \" ... estimates of job losses attributable to cap-and-trade range in the hundreds of thousands. The price for energy paid by the American consumer also will rise. The studies reviewed showed electricity prices jumping 5-15% by 2015, natural gas prices up 12-50% by 2015, and gasoline prices up 9-145% by 2015.\" http://www.usnews.com... There is no justification. The resolution is negated.', 'Sorry about the forfeit KFC', 'I will let my opponent go first. \"resolved that the cap and trade legislation of 2009 was justified\" may the force be with you', 'Your argument is good, your points are well made, and I have just realized one thing. That is, that each of us agree that education and punishment should be balanced, right? Now that I have isolated the things that we agree on, we can look at more concerning matters. Harlan: \"I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring.\" Can I just say, that criminals decide to donate their organs, as with the case of the gang leader in Singapore. He said to his wife and mistress that he wanted to donate his organs. After he was hanged, the organs were given to needy people, saving at least 5 lives. Harlan: \"You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life.\" Harlan, do judges really put them in for life? Face the reality, they will not be put in for life. After another 10-20 years, they\\'ll come out and kill more. \\'One-third of the nation\\'s executions take place in Texas—and the steepest decline in homicides has occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which together account for nearly half the nation\\'s executions.\\' That is a good point made by whoever made that. Harlan: \"\\'Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\\' Well, too bad. It\\'s their job.\" I can point out that people can find new jobs. Harlan: \"Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness.\" If everyone was as narrow-minded as Harlan, people would kill more openly, knowing that they won\\'t be jailed up for long. Knowing that they will be out soon. To do it all again. Thats usually/always the case. \\'Two gun\\' Crowley: \"Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do no body any harm.\" And when Crowley arrived at the electric chair, did he say: \"This is what I get for killing?\". No. He said: \"This is what I get for defending myself.\" Al Capone: \"I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" So I would like to conclude, that I reckon that education and punishment should be used together with greater effectiveness and greater efficiency. The death sentence will be used in appropriate situations. But if possible, be deterred. Therefore, the death sentence should stay, and be used under certain circumstances. Also, alright has one L.', 'The Contender has many flaws in his argument. Firstly, \"Harlan\" says \"I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear.\" This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases. The other half of his point tells us that he would like to see more \"education\" rather \"than fear\". I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose? A famous gangster and killer called Al Capone once said \"I have spent the best of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" Yes. Thats the word of the most feared gang leader in Chicago. As you can see, criminals don\\'t see how they are wrong, and they won\\'t see how they are wrong through \"education\". Men like Al Capone think like that. There is no way of escaping that fact. Secondly, \"Harlan\" doesn\\'t get the point of a death sentence. Here are his words: \"Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs.\" So what \"Harlan\" is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \"kill more people in order to get organs\". Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment. The organ donation is just a way of a \\'repayment\\' of the people they\\'ve killed etc. And also, only healthy organs will be chosen (I would also like to add that healthy blood can also be donated). And as \"Harlan\" said:\" I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized.\" This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person. Why doesn\\'t \"Harlan\" feel sorry for those who were killed? Why, \"Harlan\"? Thirdly, \"Harlan\" says: \"The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one.\" This proves that \"Harlan\" does not understand the point. I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues. And as \"Harlan\" says: \"Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution.\" Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe. And also, \"Harlan\" still doesn\\'t get the point. The death sentence is a fair punishment for a an \"attrocious\" crime. \"Harlan\" is relating the death sentence as a way of getting rid of people. That\\'s not my point! And even more important, isn\\'t a \"mental institution\" just another phrase for \"jail\"? They do have rehabilitation places in prisons you know. And lastly, \"Harlan\" says: \"There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary.\" This proves again that \"Harlan\" does not understand. We are not trying to get rid of people. We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood. We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population. We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done. And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument.', \"There once was a man who killed a couple of people, went into jail, came out to kill more people, went back in again, and killed more people after coming out. There wouldn't have been so many deaths if a death sentence was introduced. This may seem inhumane, but since when did killing people become humane? In some countries, there is no death sentence, and since there isn't, it should be introduced. First of all, death sentences reduce the number of cold criminals behind bars. They carried out serious offences, now they have to pay the price, it all seems pretty normal. Secondly, the organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them. This is a good way to repay all the lives that the criminal has killed. Thirdly, a death sentence introduced could decrease the number of murders every year. When pre-criminals hear that a death sentence is being introduced, they usually stop. This is a good way to stop serious assault and murder and a way to save lives. Thus the death sentence should be introduced to countries who don't have such a law.\", 'You know you don\\'t need to put my name in quotation marks. Allright, my opponent\\'s rebuttal was quite lengthy so I will answer each of his points in turn. \"This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases.\" This is false. Punishment does not necessarily mean death. Punishment can mean exile, jail, a fine, or even public service. You have twisted my words around so that the punishment means death. That\\'s a cheap card to play, man. \"I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose?\" I would like to clarify that I am in no way suggesting that education will completely eliminate all crime. And likewise, the fear of being punished will also (and does) not eliminate all crime. By citing a single incident of education failing to discourage a man from crime in no way proves that education is completely useless in the effort of decreasing crime. If I so pleased, I could do the same thing with your method of decreasing crime via fear, by citing incidents of people going on killing sprees despite the fact that they will almost certainly wind up in prison or in the electric chair. But regardless of the effectiveness of education when compared to fear, it must be acknowledged that education is a better foundation for society than fear. It creates a healthier atmosphere, and makes the populace moral people, rather than immoral people who are scared to act out their immoral ideas. And once more, I am not saying that punishment should be completely eliminated, I am saying that a balance should be made, with alot of emphasis on education, and less emphasis on punishment. \"So what \\'Harlan\\' is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \\'kill more people in order to get organs\\'. Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\" Here you go again twisting my words. I never said that the death sentence is in place for any purpose. This is a hypothetical debate (see resolution), and has nothing to do with any death-sentence policy that exists in real life. I was merely responding to your hypothetical death-sentence ideas, which you happened to justify on the basis that \"organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them\" (see round 1). Those are your words, not mine. What you have done in the above quote is completely changed your argument to \"The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\", while completely ignoring my rebuttal to your original point (the one you just pretended you didn\\'t make), which was that the felon\\'s organs could be used. \"This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person.\" It\\'s not so much a matter of \"feeling sorry\", as you have twisted my words to say, as it is honoring every Human being\\'s fundamental rights, regardless of their personality. Once more, 2 wrongs do not make a right, and with that in mind it can be said that it is not justified to deny a fellow Human being of his rights, no matter what the scenario is. I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring. \"Why doesn\\'t \\'Harlan\\' feel sorry for those who were killed?\" Where could you have possibly made this conclusion out of anything that I said in round 1? Now you are simply making up stuff that I said. \"I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues.\" Once more, this is a problem that has a simple and practical solution: don\\'t release them. You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life. \"Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\" Well, too bad. It\\'s their job. \"We are not trying to get rid of people.\" Neither of us said this. \"We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood.\" Those were your words, not mine. \"We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population.\" I never said this either. \"We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done.\" Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness. \"And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument.\" Fine, if we ARE playing that game, then I guess I\\'ll play too. In the above quote, his first sentence did not need a comma and should have had a quotation mark instead of a period, since it was phrased as a question. Also (I wasn\\'t going to say anything, but I suppose I will), he misquoted Al Capone earlier. -Harlan', 'My opponent has 3 main parts to his argument. I will answer each of these in turn. 1. That the Criminals have to \"pay the price\". It is a commonly accepted moral concept that two wrongs do not make a right. Basicaly, immoral acts are never warranted, even when the victim of said acts is inhumane and immoral to the extreme. The moral aspects of this ideology are obviously flawed. The only practical aspect of this is idea is that it may discourage people from performing horrible acts. I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear. 2. The organs of felons could be harvested and put into the bodies of other people. Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs. Furthermore, I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized. Or at least consent from the family. It also seems unlikely to me that the sort of people who end up getting the death sentance are people who are very healthy. 3. It would decrease the # of murders. The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one. And even if this were a genuine problem, the most serious of prisoners (that might have people on the outside who could break them out), could simply put in a higher security prison, such as alkatraz. This seems like a practical and humane solution to the same problem. Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution. There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary. And while it would be more efficient, it is inhumane. It is not absolutely necessary, and therefore it should be avoided, considering the matter at hand.', 'Health care is a hot topic right now. I would love to have debated whatever facet the instigator offered. He refused. 1. I asked for definitions and Con refused. 2. I asked for clarification on broad terms and Con refused. I cannot debate the Pro side of a topic the instigator refuses to define and clarify. When a new debater offers a debate with vague terms, I generally attack whatever premise can be culled and I ask for definitions and sources. This method allows for a solid round 2 and a chance to offer a conclusion. I was more than fair in this debate. I am sorry to voters that Con insisted on using broad terms so as to move the definition when challenged. The best method to deal with rhetoric is to force the user to provide definitions for the offered terms. Con simply refused to define his position, so I had no need to present mine. He formed the debate; he posts the requested information. I was not asking for much, just some support and some definitions for the terms he decided to use so I could clash with them. I challenged the few positions Con offered and none deal with \"health care\". I recommend Con try much harder next time. Con offered nothing but rhetoric and hot buttons words, but still finds the need to compare me to a politician. Con is experiencing psychological projection here as politicians avoid direct answers and, generally, refuse to define terms. The Pro/Con here is not relevant. Con instigated a debate and refused to clarify the resolution or provide some context and meaning to the used terms. I cannot be forced to support a burden for a position that the instigator refused to define.', 'I thank Con for his response and I want to be clear that I am not trying to be difficult. I ask for definitions so I can see your full point and I can avoid misunderstandings. At this point, Con has only used hot button terms like \"big government\". I enjoy debating not punditry. Television personalities like Hannity and Olberman enjoy throwing out vague terms so they can change the definition when a guest responses well. I have no time for such nonsense. I asked for definitions and Con refused to provide them. I asked for sources and Con made little effort to supply them. Am I asking too much? I will try to deal with Con\\'s response. Con agrees the government has run the military efficiently so the statement referencing the government\\'s inability to run anything is refuted. Con then moves the goal posts on me and now claims, \"There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military.\" Ok, I don\\'t use the word \"absolutely\" in reference to future outcomes unless I am dealing with math, and even then I am cautious. If you would tell me what you mean by a government take over then we can talk. Do you mean regulations? Hospitals becoming government owned? Do mean government ran health care competing against private carriers? Are you talking about Medicare? How can I address such a vague point? The statement is simply rhetorical and has little meaning. Con follows with a statement referencing less government in healthcare right now. Well we do not have a universal health coverage plan currently so are you referencing current regulations? Medicare? Do you see the problem here, Con? You chose hot buttons \"big government\" and \"government take over\" and then referenced the present day situation. He states: \"The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way.\" \"If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to.\" This must be present day so how does it apply to current legislation in Congress which has not passed? Now if this is the case we can avoid any discussion about health care proposals, but Con goes further and asks for tort reform. He states: \"If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform.\" I thought you wanted less government involvement. Tort reform in reference to malpractice cases would require MORE involvement from the government, not less as tort law and damages is generally left up to the states, not the federal government. http://www.settlementcentral.com... This is one of the problems with allowing interstate commerce with insurance companies. Your proposal involves more federal control, not less. Why would you remove state involvement in torts, by claiming the federal government should step in and reform torts at a federal level all the while claiming you want less federal government? At this point, your rhetoric is contradictory so how can I debate an issue you refuse to define and go against a contradictory position? All I can do is point out the flaws in your position as I still have no idea what the Con position is saying. Con states: \"I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american (sic) but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true.\" This is an argument from ignorance and yes claims need support. If you are unwilling to support your arguments, don\\'t present them. I have no need to address this further. Con states: \"This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda.\" Did I mention Hannity already? This statement needs support. Define radical socialists, administration, and what exactly this \"administration\" has done concerning a furtherance of this \"radical socialist agenda.\" This is just hot button rhetoric and needs not be addressed further. Con must do better than right wing pundit talking points. \"First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government.\" If you would have defined socialism I could have addressed this point. Socialism is so broad that I cannot, in the space provided, explain all facets, but as instigator you certainly could have done so. You chose not to give us a definition so I have nothing to clash with at this point. \"Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate.\" On a dark and stormy night … not so much. President Obama spoke directly to Republicans concerning many issues in the health care debate. How is this in the cover of darkness? I can read all the legislation presented on this subject as it is publicly available. President Obama made clear when running for President that he supported universal coverage in reference to health care and would focus on implementing legislation in this respect. We all had a vote. We elected him. How is this secretive? More and more rhetoric, nothing solid here. I\\'m tired. The only point Con brought forward was a poll. He did not link the poll, the methodology, the margin of error, nothing. He said it was there. Rasmussen? I would love to view the methodology used and see the full results but unlike truly scientific polls, the results are hidden … unless you pay for them. \"All the data collected by Rasmussen Reports, not just the portion we make public.\" For 20 bucks a month, no thank you. http://www.rasmussenreports.com... Really? Talk about \"in the cover of darkness\". The instigator has offered very little here. I cannot address a contention unless it is defined. Rhetoric is for the mindless masses, I need facts and data, or at a minimum, definitions.', 'I wish him good luck. I stand in refutation to my opponent\\'s contentions and will address them. Con wrote, \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything. \" I disagree. Our government has run one of the most powerful armed forces in the world. As for dysfunctional government, I recommend Somalia. Next my opponent offers that health care, an ambiguous term, encompasses 1/6 of the US economy. I ask my opponent, as he is the instigator, to support this statement and I ask for a definition of economy in relation to this figure. I cannot attack a figure my opponent does not source. Define health care also please. Con offers polls, but offers…no polls! Show me and I will deal with them. He then offers some rhetoric in the form of \"cramming down our throats\". Cramming what? Be more specific. Tell me what the US government crammed down my throat. Con wants to hear from those who have blind faith in big government. I am not sure who these people are, but I support my government and as a former member of the greatest Air Force in the world, I swore my life to our defense. I no not support blind faith in any matters, religious or otherwise, and Con did not define big government or blind faith. At this point, the instigator has only offered one solid contention and that contention is that the US government cannot run anything, but I submit that the US military run by our government is the greatest in the world. I can do little more until the instigator presents a case with something more than rhetoric.', \"Wow, Pro is quite the technical debater. I have a lot of respect for his skills. To be honest I was expecting to have an ideological debate. I think Pro would make a fine politician. However, here is the problem as I see it. Americans hate politicians because they are masters at doing the same thing you are doing. They talk and talk about data and polls and margins of error and everyone is left with their heads spinning. It is a very calculated technique used to where down opposition until they just throw their hands up and say fine just do whatever. To use another sports analogy, I shoot and you block over and over again. This is a very safe way for you to win a debate and you most likely will but we still have little idea of why universal health is good for America. Instead of only blocking how about a shot. Pro chose to be pro on health care. So lets hear some pro commentary. Pro does not need to sit there on his high horse waiting for me to deliver the perfectly executed and statistical debate. Pro should just state where he stands. If Pro was a politician, what would his platform be. I want to hear why moving toward more government control of our health care is better. I believe the reason the health care bill is having so much trouble is because no one can really explain why and how it is better. Admittedly I spend most my time working so I do have time to hear or read everything but this is true with most Americans. So why doesn't Pro educate me and tell me and anyone who might read this what part of the health care monstrosity bill is good and what part is not. I will be honest about my ideology. Brace yourself because it is very radical. I want to return to the constitution. What is Pro's ideology.\", 'First of all I want to say that i love the US military. Pro is right it is a very functional part of government. However, I certainly would not put the military and government in the same category. They respond to executive commands from the feds but are a completely separate substructure to the government. It is made up of extremely talented and qualified personnel operating under a chain of command in a enviroment of extreme competition and accountablity. There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military. Besides the military is something that the citizens can not do for themselves. Health care on the other hand is. The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way. Abraham Lincoln said that \"The worst thing you can do for those you love is the things they could and should do themselves\". If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to. I can\\'t event buy health insurance across state lines if I want to. The solution is less government, not more. What if I went to my job and the more I screw up the more i was promoted. That would not make sense. So why with the feds we continue to give them more power the more they screw up? I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true. Just look at the debt we are in that we will never be able to get out of. Health care for everyone will only ad to this debt. If you believe universal health care will save us money than i have some beach front property i would like to sell you. If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform. This is not an accident. This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda. I\\'m not saying that socialism is a bad thing as long as everyone knows exactly how it works and what it is. First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government. If we are able to have an open and honest debate about how much government we want and Americans decide they want to move away from our founders had intended then I am ok with that. But it does not happen like that. Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate. I found in Rasmussen that 52% of voters oppose the proposed health care plan while 44% favor. As far as the 1/6 economy comment, just type that sentence in google and you will see lots of stats to prove it. I agree with Pro that what i have said is mostly rhetoric based on opinion. But this is the format of debate i would like have with someone. Statistical battles rarely get you anywhere. I would like to have a general discussion about how much government we want and how much individual responsiblity we want. Pro has a tactic to win a debate which consists of delegitimizing my argument but i am still waiting for someone to come up with some solid points that stand on its own to support the need for big government. Can anyone out there do this?', \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything never the less something as large as health care that makes up about 1/6 of the US economy. The polls have shown that the people don't believe so either but yet they still try to cram it down our throats. I would like to hear from some people who still have this blind faith in big government.\", \"My closing statement is that we have known for years the earth is not flat. It's like arguing that Barack Obama is Satan.\", 'I am so sorry for the forfeit and the lateness of this argument. I understand how pointless it can make a debate seem, however I really like this one. Thank you for the extension. To start with my opening argument, I will use your definition of \\'flat.\\' I agree that the surface is wide, however, it is far from smooth. Because our world is three dimensional, things clearly stick out of the ground, such as the house or apartment you live in[2]. The earth definitely does not have little thickness, either. In fact, it is more than 4,000 miles deep[1]! This would also mean mountains and earthquakes would be unable to form[7]. Your definition of flat does not fit the earth. However, it is a lot closer to being spherical. From satellite images, we see the earth as a circle{1}. We can also see different countries on the earth depending on the angle, while the circle does not change size{2}. That would bring us to the logical conclusion that it must instead be a sphere. Rebuttals: If we lived on the flat side of the earth\\'s circle, and not the curved edge, your explanation of the sun and moon\\'s rotation would not hold up. Instead of the sun appearing to rise one way and set the other, it would seem to appear already in the sky and slowly rotate in one direction. It would be the same way with the moon. They would ever cross the center of the earth without having no sun at all for the rest of the planet either, and would completely invalidate our system of time[3] and make day and night nonexistent. This model also causes problems with the rest of our solar system. We have proven that the planets rotate around the sun[4]. If the sun rotated around the earth instead, the other planets would not have the same days of their own[5]. \"Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick.\" That paragraph made little sense grammatically, but I think I understood the point. If I were zooming past earth at the speed of light, I of course would see nothing as our eyes can\\'t process things that fast[6]. If your idea for gravity were true, then the water in the oceans would be forced off the planet because it is not contained. Sources: [1] http://www.livescience.com...

One more definition: Earth: the planet on which we live; the world. From Google This should be fun, thank you for the challenge!', 'All points extended.', 'Okay so let\\'s get down to some crazy things for this wounderous debate. So to clarify I will be debating that the Earth is flat by using the Neo-Classical Model with the following descripition. The earth is finite disk. The earth is being accelerate upwards at approximately 9.80665 m/s2. The earth is the only known \"disk\" in the universe. The laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame. The speed of light, measured in any inertial reference frame, always has the same value, c. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) Contention 1: Rotation of sun and the seasons. One of the greatest questions you have right now is probably if the Earth is flat how does day and night work. Well the answer is actually that the Sun and the moon rotate around the Earth in a circular motion. As seen in the gif that I\\'ve provided above you can painly see that ti\\'s a spotlight type roation as it rotates around the Earth illuminating only a certain portion of the Earth at a time simulating both night and day. Here we can the if we were a photon that the Earth would shrink to ironically the same thickness that I have previously described. Here is a simulator that shows the exact same thing. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Seasons are explained above. As the Sun moves closer to the poles it becomes colder in the northern hemisphere while when the Sun is closer to the equatro it is actually summer time. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) If we use the above model we can see that the Earth is indeed the center of the Universe. Though the other planets may orbit the sun we can see that the sun and the rest of the solar system orbits around the Earth. Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick. Contention 2: Gravity Now before you jump to several statements that Gravity should collapse the Earth into a sphere there is just one problem with that. Gravity doesn\\'t exist. How in the world is this you may ask. Well you can see that the Earth is actually accelerating up at the acceration of 9.88 meters per second. This explains Newton\\'s gravitationial theory, but Newton was incorrect here. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) With the increased accerlation it becomes apparent that this also causes you to be shorter at the end of the day. Now to further this I would like to clarify that gravitation, not gravity exists. This explains the tides as stars and the moon/other celestial bodies all have slight gravitationial pull. Here is a list on how they are different in order to clarify the debate up a tad bit. - Gravity or the gravitational field is a vector field, while gravitational force is only a vector. - Gravity lies in the radial direction from the mass, while gravitational force is in the direction of the line connecting the two masses. - Gravitational field requires only one mass, while two masses are required for gravitational force. - Gravitational force is equal to the product of the mass of the test object and the gravitational field intensity. (http://www.differencebetween.com...) Now I want you to imagin living on this Earth, which as I showed earlier is just a flat disk. The gravitational force is actually angled to the point to where as you get further and further away from the center (the north pole) you can see that the increasing gravitationial force would cause you to want to fall back towards the center and not want to go towards the edge of the Earth. The people living away from the north pole would have their living conditions inclined in order to meet such a force. It would feel like you are trying to clime up a steeper and steeper hill. Contary to belief you wouldn\\'t fall off the edge due to the gravitationial vector pointing back towards the north pole, the actual fear would be falling off the edge and rolling back towards the center as shown in the picture above. That is all for my opening arguments and my rebuttles shall come in the next round as requested by my opponent.', \"This debate is impossible to accept.

I thank my opponent for his response, and look forward to the final round :) I ran out of characters in RD 1 for the proper thank yous and whatnot. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On instinct (clarification of my position): My opponent fundamentally misunderstands the argument I\\'m making in terms of instinct, especially in terms of stratification. We didn\\'t emulate the behavior of other animals—we are an animal, and animals all have the instinct to stratify. Stratification is a part of survival, as is socialization. My opponent also disregards all of my analysis that actually validates the stratification argument. Allow me to reiterate: 1. Stratification does not have to be negative. Animals other than human beings don\\'t tend to oppress. They simply establish an order, with survival-related duties, and are able to work cooperatively to achieve a desired end, which is the survival of the entire community. Stratification does not have to be a servant to self-love, as my opponent asserts. Greed and superiority are not the same as natural herd stratification. Don\\'t allow him to equate the two. 2. I never wanted us to disregard the teachings of men like Marx. In fact, I specifically stated in RD 1 that there are pieces of profound truth to communist theory that we should be integrating into our political and social realities. However, I still maintain that a society without any sort of stratification is an impossibility, simply because stratification is a survival tool utilized by all members of the animal kingdom. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On stratification and its characterization (important extension here): My opponent severely overestimates my conception of stratification. I don\\'t believe I was unclear prior, but if I was, I apologize. Capitalism, in and of itself, does not encourage any of the harms that my opponent or Marx accuse it of. In fact, as I stated in RD 1, all governments are liable to these shortcomings, as all governments are made of a mixed bag of people. Until humans are homogeneously altruistic, Communism can\\'t work. This is a key point that I want the voters to extend, as my opponent and Marx fail to take human differentiation into account. Capitalism operates within the realm of observed human behavior while giving humanity room to grow into more altruistic tendencies (as Capitalism uses these behaviors and instincts to benefit the entire community—see Adam Smith). Communism requires that all of its followers be uniformly virtuous from the beginning, which is purely unrealistic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On self-interest (my opponent\\'s same tag line): Self-love, as Adam Smith calls it, keeps the butcher being a butcher. My opponent has yet to clearly articulate how goods and services would be exchanged within a Communist system while not creating the stratification that I say is necessary to keep a society functioning at equilibrium. If the butcher can do something easier and still receive the same amount of goods or services in return, then the butcher will choose the easier profession. This is not a categorically true scenario, but it is highly realistic. While societies have made some misjudgments and mistakes regarding which professions deserve more merit than others, this is yet another moment where pieces of communist theory might temper the functioning of a Capitalist system. However, if I am to receive no merit for spending 10 years in medical school, racking up debts and killing myself for the benefit of society, why should I be a brain surgeon? Again, my opponent assumes that all people can or will be homogeneous in their altruism, which is simply untrue. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ On \"rotten apples\": My opponent is making categorical assertions about Capitalism based on some of its misapplication in the world. Not every capitalist society operates in this fashion. Capitalism is a spectrum of application, and this is just more evidence as to why Communism can\\'t work. Capitalism at least accounts for human differentiation and arms people with tools to fight back against the \"rotten apples.\" Since my opponent enjoys making generalizations about existing governments, I\\'ll make one in turn: all manifestations of Communism have degenerated into Socialism. Why? The reason is because the naivete of the theory makes it supremely simple to dupe an entire population into dictatorship. The fact that multiple forms of Capitalism have succeeded in the world while Communism has not, after multiple attempts, suggests that education cannot overcome all. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On proletariat revolution & oppressor vs. oppressed (key extension here): 1. Marx really does advocate the entire overthrow of the current social system. He says this directly in his manifesto. I can quote it if my opponent would like me to do so. 2. The French Revolution is precisely the sort of thing that Freire was talking about, so I\\'m not sure how my opponent, who is a student of Communist theory, can simply shrug off my comparison. While the French Revolution wasn\\'t ever meant to instill Communism, it is a direct, historical example of the oppressed becoming extreme oppressors. Rather than simply eliminating the current social order via the head of state, the middle & lower class uprising felt it necessary to murder thousands of nobles, as well, most of whom merely held a title higher than the revolutionaries\\'. Even Freire, a passionate Communist and Marxist, admits that this is an incredibly dangerous result of Proletariat uprisings. And the French Revolution isn\\'t the only time we\\'ve seen this result. Look to Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as much of South America. 3. While violence and the switching of superiority may contradict Communism\\'s ultimate goal, that doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t happen. My opponent entirely drops all arguments I make for the necessity of retribution within humanity\\'s schema of justice, which is huge to my advocacy. The reason the roles tend to switch is because of our need for retributive justice, which is another human trait seen unadulteratedly around the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In summation, my opponent has still not been able to prove that Communism, as Marx envisioned it, can actually exist for any amount of time. I remind voters that he must prove that human beings can be uniformly altruistic, and that human beings do not need natural stratification in order to survive. Also, I want to especially highlight the problems Communism has with retributive justice. Since my opponent did not address this, I encourage you to weigh this heavily in the round.', 'Communism, in theory, espouses noble ideals for humanity. It encourages, essentially, blind equality and shared resources, and discourages the stratification that seems to plague the planet\\'s human societies. However, though we may learn many tidbits of wisdom with which we may perfect human existence, a truly unadulterated Communist society we shall never see. While I normally would not write a case in this fashion, today\\'s arguments will be primarily in essay form, as my advocacy requires it. My apologies. My primary assertion today is that it is genetically and instinctually impossible to achieve a society in which stratification and self-interest are not a part of the political or ideological equation. Everything that humanity does may be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to its instincts. We are animals. We make the supreme & egotistical mistake time and time again of forgetting our membership in this kingdom of beasts. Yes, we have an ability to rationalize that extends far beyond our animal brethren, but we, like they, are still slaves to our genetic urges. The only difference is that we have more chance of overcoming some of them than other animals do. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We\\'ll start with stratification. Marx, in his manifesto, makes some very damning claims against the bourgeois class at the time, and blames Capitalism for a number of things: \"The bourgeoisie…has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \"natural superiors,\" and has left no other bond between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment.\" It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.\" (http://www.marxists.org...) Unfortunately for Marx, this is largely unwarranted, since feudal, monarchical, dictatorial, and even \"communist\" systems have exhibited the same evils as a society that is operated by a free market. Materialism, therefore, cannot be blamed for the cold calculations of the wealthy against everyone else. Stratification, light or severe, can be found in every society on the planet, without exception. Something so universal, and something that existed long before the concept of Capitalism, must be to blame. Stratification, therefore, is much more likely due to human nature, even if it is a \"misfiring\" upper class amongst a sea of altruism. Even in the most peaceful societies in existence, some sort of social hierarchy is present. Just as in the rest of the animal kingdom, a chain of being exists naturally amongst humans. We can be compared to packs, prides, or flocks. A social theory that seeks to break apart our natural understanding of the world will inevitably fail, because people will inevitably gravitate toward this hierarchy. Now, it does not compute that this hierarchy must be bad. This is, perhaps, where humanity could learn something from men like Marx & Freire. A readjustment of how we perceive the hierarchy would probably lead to a far more peaceful existence than the power struggles we witness today. However, that\\'s not what Communism wants. It wants a full restructuring in that it wants an elimination of social structure, which would go against every societal instinct within the human condition. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, onto self-interest. I do not want my opponent to mischaracterize self-interest negatively right off the bat as selfishness. The two are distinct in that self-interest has a clear instinctual foundation. Every animal in the animal kingdom is concerned with its own survival. Granted, instinctually, we are all also concerned on some level with helping our species thrive, as well. This would be the altruistic side of our genetics. But, self-interest is undeniable. While we, unlike other animals, have the unique ability to interpret, weigh out, and even deny some instincts, we won\\'t categorically do this. Hence, any political theory that seeks to paint the human animal as something that it cannot physically be will fail monumentally, as it cannot account for even the smallest variations from the concept of blind equality. Adam Smith, expositor of capitalist theory and moral philosopher, characterizes a positive system of societal order as one which uses the instinct of self-interest to the benefit of the society. He says, in Wealth of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.\" While this may seem callous, it is not. It is merely a metacognitive examination of rhetoric which speaks to instincts, and seeks to manipulate our natural desire for self-preservation in order to benefit society as a whole. Adam Smith, of course, did not categorically apply this to all of society\\'s transactions. This quotation, as I said before, is merely an examination of more extreme rationale. Though not every member of society provides goods and services in order to self-serve, it is the butcher, baker, or brewer that is overly concerned with self-interest that Communism has no place for, but that would exist in the world even if it weren\\'t for Capitalist theory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The gist of this analysis leads me to two final theoretical concerns regarding Communism: the tragedy of the commons and the oppressed turning oppressor. Tragedy of the commons, attributed to Garrett Hardin, claims that it only takes a handful of overly self-interested people to exploit the resources of a shared community, which then make it impossible for that community to survive. Hardin uses the example of a shared pasture for cattle grazing. A handful of farmers may agree to share this land, but if 1 of those farmers sneaks out into the middle of the night to graze his herd more out of self-interest, it will cost the community severely. Let\\'s pretend, for a moment, that self-interest is merely a fluke, an anomaly in the genetic world. Statistically, those who abuse others due to self-interest will find their way into these Communistic communities. After all, self-interest would compel you to reside with such altruistic people, for they are the easiest to exploit. Secondly, Paulo Freire describes the problem of the relationship between the oppressed and the oppressor. Quite readily, self-interest manifested turns to vengeful and retributive behavior. When a people has suffered to such a great extent, the psychological need for justice, for what is equitable, will make equilibrium nearly impossible to achieve. This need for retribution expresses itself in every justice system in the world, though some are more severe than others. The US and other first world nations have tempered retribution with a delicate and convoluted system of proportionality. In places like Rwanda, retribution is manifested in genocide. Either way, the oppressed, the victim, will generally require some sort of psychological or philosophical satisfaction that moves beyond simply removing power from an oppressor. The need for penalty or punishment is another universal human interest that my opponent will need to deal with on a biological level in order to convince us that Communism will succeed.', \"I appreciate my opponent's candor in RD 3, and hope to debate him again many times in the future. Enjoy the first 2 rounds, voters!\", 'My opponent asserts that Marx\\'s criticism and damning of the system is very specifically aimed at Capitalism. This, slightly, draws attention from the main point of Marx\\'s goal, and that is the elimination of the social conditionining of a need for a tangible reward for a service. This conditioning is seen in all systems of government my opponent has listed: traders in village markets in a Feudalistic society, etc. My opponent also claims that humans will naturally form hierarchies because we are animals; and since the rest of the animal kingdom does so, we, naturally, should as well. It is true that we are animals, only more rational and cognitive. Though, this does not mean that we should be inclined to form hierarchies to satisfy our apparent \\'instinct\\'. Though, to first address a big issue; is it an instinct? Or is it, just as greed is, a behavior learned from our environment? Humans, since the beginning of time, have used nature as a reference and resource to how to live and operate. Is it possible that somewhere along our timeline of social evolution, we observed the process of stratification in the Animal Kingdom and emulated the behavior? It wouldn\\'t be the first time this would happen. Many \\'human\\' behaviors and inventions have been inspired by nature: Business, Farming, Medicine, etc. In resolution, we, as humans, should use our gift of logic and reason, and be able to willfully transcend any inherent, or learned need to set others either superior or inferior. There is no excuse that someone can surmount to contradict this; except a personal testimony of their physical and mental inability to willfully overcome any tendency to need to be socially and monetarily rewarded greater than another, only because society has perceived their profession as more \\'important\\'. Is it so hard to restrain one\\'s self from needing a controlled currency, and to contribute to society with their ability and be given necessities? A misconception is that this will prevent people from attaining possessions that they want; this is simply untrue. Marx\\'s quote \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" doesn\\'t merely mean that you are only given your bare necessities and left at that. The quote is only a way for people to see anew, a type of life that would be truly altruistic. The only way for this type of civlilization to actually happen, is for people to learn; and this is done through the long and enduring, but rewarding, process of education. Not fascist, brainwashing education, as seen 1984, but true, non-regimented, open-minded education. ---------------- Now to address my opponent\\'s argument for self-interest. It is true that self-interest is not entirely selfish, as it is how we survive, and does not always lead to the misery of others to sustain our prosperity. But, where exactly does self interest exclude itself from a Communistic society? Look at it from this perspective. The butcher is good at his/her job and wishes to provide to society in the only way that he/she can, effectively. But, the butcher also wants to be able to have a home and the necessities, and pleasures, in life. Through self interest (as mentioned before, not selfishness), the butcher continues to do his/her job in order to be a positive member of the community, because they understand that if they do what they are skilled at doing, they will receive the desired necessities and simple pleasures of life. Self-interest needs not to be completely abolished in a Communistic society. In regards to the issue of the few rotten apples spoiling the bunch. .. Denying that there would be a presence of people unwilling to adapt to the philosophies in a Communistic society, would be ignorant. But as I said before when speaking about the issue of the learned behavior to stratify; education trumps all problems; maybe not completely, as perfection is impossible. But the waning of the greed ridden mindset that would trouble a Communistic society, wouldn\\'t be out of the question. Now, I\\'m NOT advocating that any persons not wishing to \\'assimilate\\' to this livelihood of the new society be discriminated against, or singled out for immediate attention (similar to what America has done with \\'failures\\' in the IQ system haha) and be \\'fixed\\', mentally. I\\'m only saying, that education, throughout a person\\'s life, would allow them the chance to understand that the old mindset of \"I work, and I receive the payment accredited, even if it is more than another\\'s\" is unnecessary and leads to nothing but conflict. My opponent then asserts that in the event that a Proletarian revolution occurs, the Proletariat will want blood in exchange for the oppression that they suffered at the hands of the Bourgeoisie. Although this has been seen many times in history whenever a major anarchical event has happened, this would not be the French Revolution. Although Marx did predict that some, if not most, of the worker\\'s revolutions would involve violence; he predicted this not for the reason of the worker\\'s hate for the Bourgeoisie, but, possibly, as a necessary measure to break free from the chains instituted by the elite class. Now, I may have initiated a mindset of \"He\\'s an anarchist and wants to overthrow everything! etc. . \"; but this is not my goal. I unequivocally believe that, like Dr. King\\'s peaceful civil rights movement, we can achieve an extreme change in our society, without violence and turmoil (By the Proletariat, the same cannot be said for the challenged Bourgeoisie). If a violent, vindictive revolution were to occur, it would be the antithesis of the entire point of a Marxist revolution; the point of which, is the equalization of all. Wouldn\\'t it be a complete and utter contradiction of the belief to punish others for their past \\'deeds\\', therefore placing them below those involved with the revolution, merely switching the roles of superiority, hence contradicting the main philosophy of the revolution? \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" - Karl Marx', 'The idea of Communism in this debate, is a society in which Bourgeoisie and Proletariat no longer exist, and only people, no longer identified through monetary or social value, are left. The idea of government (Government defined as a selective ruling body that decides how people should live; no matter how involved the citizens, it is defined as this) has been abolished. People dictate their own lives.', \"I misjudged how much I could handle, and spent too much time on one debate. And so, as a result, I will have to forfeit this debate, as well as another one in the process as well. Hopefully in the next few days, when I'm less busy, we can re open this debate, or even change sides for fun :D Please vote for my opponent, as I haven't been able to fully articulate my argument. , and she has put a lot of effort into this debate, and deserves the win. Thank you :D\", 'When Tommy took on the Gatlin boys, it is true that he could not undo the rape, nor could he instill guilt in people of such a brutish nature. However, he did show much more than the fact that he has the ability to punch people. He showed that he would no longer allow himself to be pushed around. That one act and the statement made by it could\\'ve quite possibly turned Tommy\\'s life around for the better. In this case and many others, the saying \"Action speaks louder than words\" is applicable. In my previous arguments, I have possibly been misconstrued. The fact that most wars were unnecessary does not indicate a concession on my part. I clearly stated in Round 1 \"Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them.\" My stance is not \"that all war is good for something.\" Rather, my stance is that war is good for MORE than absolutely nothing. There is a difference between these two views. Now when it comes to my examples of people fighting for their own self-defense, their dignity, and their honor, you ask \"What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive.\" But cannot the same things be said of the morals and compassion you mention? These too can be viewed as \"made up human concepts.\" If concepts such as these render an argument invalid, then your arguments stand to lose just as much validity as mine. You also claim that \"Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself.\" But when that self is multiplied by a large number, as was the case in Scotland, then a large section of humanity has been helped. In the section on intelligence, you say that people can still see that life is better than death. Even this may be debatable given some of the stupidity I\\'ve witnessed. Nevertheless, this is not what needs to be understood. The issue is whether or not the majority of people have the ability to see someone else\\'s perspective on a situation. Many people do not have this ability, and I do not believe that an unintelligent leader would either. George W. Bush is a leader that barely has the intelligence to comprehend a coloring book. Does it seem like he can understand the viewpoints of others? Mentioning the budget for the War on Terror can only speak against that war and others similar to it. It cannot serve to counter the rationale behind the wars I mentioned, which took place long before such budgets were associated with the act of war. (Note: I did check off that I\\'m in favor of The War on Terror in my profile, but this does not mean I agree with any of the budgets, policies, or methods used.) When it comes to the points on ignorance, you seem to think education can enlighten everyone. This is sadly not the case. I have been in countless classes where people would simply not understand a concept no matter how often it was repeated or how many times it was explained. Teaching acceptance of others also would not work. Oftentimes two opposing viewpoints are irreconcilable. If this were not the case, a site such as this could not exist. On your other point, I do realize that if both sides stop violence, then my self-defense reasoning does not apply. The problem is that even this is not as simple as it seems. You state \"Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end.\" But the dynamics involved in the beginnings of a war are rarely so cut and dry. What Riley from the Boondocks needs to understand is that there are situations in which neither side realizes that anything is starting until it is too late. Look at the current situation in the U.S. Rights are being taken away, but both the government and the majority of the citizens feel that it is justified. If and when the situation turns ugly, which side will it be that \"started\" something? The chain of events that can lead to war is highly complex, dependent upon many factors, and very dynamic. It is not one side slapping and the other defending. That is just a gross simplification. I have shown examples where war can be used as self-defense. But it may have another use. Namely, keeping the human population in check. For every species, there is a population limit. In biology this is known as the carrying capacity and is symbolized by the letter \"k.\" The current population is roughly 6.5 billion! What would it be without wars? It is possible that we would\\'ve reached the carrying capacity, and at that point mass deaths would\\'ve occurred. These totals would\\'ve been higher than the amount seen in war. Theoretically, most of the population is wiped out. So wars are good for both population control and self-defense. Having both of these uses, they can definitely been seen as good for more than absolutely nothing. To Darth_Grievous_42: I too thought this was a good debate. You presented some excellent arguments that kept me on my toes. And to satisfy your curiosity, my picture is the cover of the Pink Floyd album Meddle.', 'Coward Of The County by Kenny Rogers Everyone considered him the coward of the county. He\\'d never stood one single time to prove the county wrong. His mama named him Tommy, the folks just called him yellow, But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison. I looked after Tommy \\'cause he was my brothers son. I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy: \"Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun. Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.\" Theres someone for everyone and Tommy\\'s love was Becky. In her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man. One day while he was workin the Gatlin boys came callin. They took turns at Becky.... there was three of them! Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy\\'s picture. As his tears fell on his daddys face, he heard these words again: Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom. One of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor. When Tommy turned around they said, \"Hey look! old yeller\\'s leavin.\" But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door. Twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him. He wasn\\'t holdin nothin back; he let \\'em have it all. When Tommy left the barroom not a Gatlin boy was standin. He said, \"This one\\'s for Becky,\" as he watched the last one fall. And I heard him say, I promised you, dad, not to do the things you\\'d done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please dont think Im weak, I didnt turn the other cheek, And papa, I sure hope you understand: Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man. Everyone considered him the coward of the county. Although this applies only to one individual, many of the conflicts previously mentioned could be analagous. After all, what was the conflict in Scotland during the late 13th and early 14th centuries if not a case of the Gatlin boys picking on someone? The only difference is that there were larger numbers on both sides. Even the rape of Becky took place in the form of prima nocte. I have read through your arguments, and I suppose the main problem I have with them is your over-optimistic viewpoints. Of course if there are two viable options: one being war and the other being a logical discussion to work out the differences, the discussion is to be preferred. The problem is that there are many people that do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss things or to bother to try and understand an opposing viewpoint. When you state \"Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past\" I must ask what the \\'us\\' refers to. If it refers to you and I, then you are correct. But if it refers to the human population in general, I beg to differ. Despite the many claims you may hear about humans being a superior species, I can assure you that most humans are actually quite lacking in intelligence. Not only are there many that cannot see the mistakes of the past, they will almost certainly repeat those same mistakes in the future. You say \"All the examples you have stated so far are all situations [where] reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine.\" Is this really true? Do you really believe that the Scots could\\'ve said \"Hey wait! Let\\'s talk this out nicely.\"? Even if they could, would you want to resolve the issue with a nice discussion after somebody had just raped your wife? Of course they would claim that it was a legal right, but this it is still unacceptable. As the penultimate line of Coward of the County states: \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man.\" My main point is that reason and understanding cannot be implanted into the minds of others. When you state \"The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory\" you are absolutely correct. They shouldn\\'t have done these things. The problem is they did. If a child decides to stick up for himself and hit a bully back after the bully starts with him, the child that fought back cannot be condemned. Of course anyone can still make the correct statement \"The bully should\\'ve never started with him in the first place.\" This is true, but it is what bullies do. Similarly, when the British invade Zulu territory, the Zulus cannot be condemned for starting the Anglo-Zulu war. Did the war have to be fought? No. But that doesn\\'t make it wrong. The child could\\'ve let the bully pick on him and avoid a fight as well. But letting issues get resolved through such passive action is not good. People should have the right to defend themselves. You claim \"Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death.\" This is not the case. There are a great many people in this world that will not be affected by words. They either won\\'t care or they won\\'t have the intelligence to understand them. I know this may seem like an extremely uncivilized and savage claim, but bullets, missiles and bombs are the only reasoning that many of these brutes will understand. As unsophisticated as this may sound, it is sadly the truth. I don\\'t have the space to reiterate all of the lyrics to War and go through them all once more, but there are a few other points I\\'d like to make concerning some of them. \"Who wants to die?\" You claim that it is only an escape for a temporary situation. But an excellent point is made in the movie V for Vendetta. When the character V tortures Natalie Portman he shows her that death is actually not the worst thing. There are some principles that exist that are worth dying for. This ultimate realization came to her, as it did to V at the end of the movie. He knew that he would die on that final night, and yet that paled in comparison to his goal of changing the corrupt government and giving hope to the other citizens. You ask \"Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice?\" Perhaps if they could, but this is an impossibility. The point of many of these sacrifices is that the principle was worth more than life. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" To this you state \"Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past.\" Now this may be true, but not realistic. Brains cannot be instilled in those that are not learned. Your view is extremely optimistic, but in reality a leopard cannot fully change its spots. Those without brains will never become intellectual. And when these unintellectual brutes start trouble, no amount of compassion or brain can persuade them. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" You say to me \"You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy.\" Once again, the intelligence needed to reach a conclusion through diplomacy is not present. It would\\'ve been better, but it simply cannot happen. You also say in reference to this \"The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step?\" I\\'ll tell you why they couldn\\'t skip a step. It is not that it was physically impossible. It is that it was impossible in terms of the mental capacity required for such acts. I have no space left, but my main point is that your optimistic views are not realistic.', 'This is a very original and highly amusing means of presenting an argument. I commend you on your creativity. I will first begin by showing that war may sometimes be necessary. From there I will use examples to show that it is good for more than absolutely nothing. After the basis of my argument has been laid out, I can address all of the points in the song lyrics. Although war is often construed as a means of destruction, it can in many cases be a means of liberation. A brief look at history can show examples where war served as the only means of obtaining freedom. Take Scotland in the late 13th and early 14th centuries for example. The Scots were constantly being tyrannized by the British and were subjected to many injustices. Although the movie Braveheart dramatized and perhaps exaggerated some of the details, atrocities such as prima nocte really did occur. Another example can be seen in the Anglo-Zulu war. The British invaded the territory of the Zulus, and the Zulus decided to go to war and die rather than allow others to take over their land. This may seem pointless to you, but many would consider it brave and noble. The Zulus with primitive weapons actually defeated the British in the Battle of Isandlwana, and although many died, they died nobly. I know that in the end the Zulus lost the war, but this does not mean that people should allow invaders to take over without consequence. One more example to mention is the French Revolution. Things were so bad with unemployment, malnutrition, and even famine that people literally had to fight for their lives. Death was going to come anyway. Should it come by means of slow and torturous starvation, or should it come through a revolution that could possibly pave the road for change? In cases such as these, war can be seen as a means of self-defense. Now to address the points highlighted in the song. \"Because it means destruction Of innocent lives\" In the cases I mentioned, many innocent lives were already being destroyed. Even in cases where death is not the means of destruction, the constant tyrannical oppressions that make life unbearable can be viewed as a way of sucking the life out of innocent people. When such is the case, rising up to fight for self-preservation becomes more noble than allowing the injustices to continue. \"War means tears To thousands of mothers eyes When their sons go to fight And lose their lives\" I have no doubt that this is true. But when tears are welling up in the eyes of not only mothers, but entire populations yearning for justice, then the tears shed for those who died fighting the good fight pale in comparison. \"War, it ain\\'t nothing But a heartbreaker\" For oppressed populations, war can actually be heartlifting rather than heartbreaking. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" It is also a friend to those who have been freed by it. In fact, even corrupt coalitions that start wars to take over land may still view war as their friend if they come out victorious. They may not be good people, but it still serves to show that war is not friend ONLY to the undertaker. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" See the previous rebuttal. Not all mankind views war as an enemy. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them. There can be a very good point to starting a war. Allowing others to steamroll over you cannot be considered a valid alternative to war. \"War has caused unrest Within the younger generation\" War has done more than this. It has very likely caused unrest with people of every generation. But this cannot be used to condemn the wars previously mentioned. These people were already in a state of unrest. \"Induction then destruction\" The destruction point was previously addressed. Being inducted into a war and then destroyed is probably better than sitting and waiting for destruction to come. \"Who wants to die?\" Those with extreme suffering often choose death as a means of escape. When it comes to the oppressed, a voluntary death may be better than a life of suffering. \"Ooooh, war, has shattered Many a young mans dreams Made him disabled, bitter and mean\" I cannot contend that war has left many people disabled. This is a sad tragedy. But the bitterness is probably much more present when the disabled view the war as pointless. Many (perhaps most) wars are pointless...but not all. \"Life is much to short and precious To spend fighting wars these days\" The words \\'these days\\' seem to refer to the present. I must say that in the present day I have often felt that we may actually have to fight another revolutionary war within our own country. Atrocities such as the Patriot Act are taking away the very freedoms that made this country so great. And as the grip gets tighter and tighter, it may only be a matter of time before both you and I must choose whether to live under a dictatorship or rise up and fight. \"War can\\'t give life It can only take it away\" Is this really true? Cannot it not be said that the Treaty of Edinburgh (the end result of the conflict between Scotland and Britain) gave life to the subsequent generations of Scotland? In the French Revolution, war gave life to some who would\\'ve died of famine. \"Peace, love and understanding Tell me, is there no place for them today?\" There certainly should be a place for them. But it is impossible to have all people of all nations on the same wavelength. Consequently, many people that only wish for peace can sometimes find themselves in a situation where war becomes the lesser evil. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom But Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" I\\'ve been arguing a similar point. If there is a Lord that does know a better way, he certainly hasn\\'t informed anyone of what this is. In fact, there are many biblical accounts in which the Lord supposedly helped one side defeat another in battle. So even for those that choose to believe in some omnipotent force, a better way has yet to be revealed. My main point is that war is good for more than absolutely nothing. It is good for obtaining freedom from all types of oppression and invasion. It may even have further uses that I will explore in later rounds.', 'Ah, you found a rebuttal song. Very nice. Well, what exactly was it that Tommy achieved by beating up the Gatlin boys? Did he take the rape back magically? Did the boys feel bad about what they did? Did he prove he was a man? No, he accomplished none of these things, all he did was show he could punch people. That\\'s about it. After reading your last round it seems you completely agree with me that war should be avoided. So then you concede this debate? Your stance is that all war is good for something. But in this last round you\\'ve taken the stance that \"war should be avoided, but it just won\\'t\". I cannot deny that what was done in the past was done and served a purpose. I can\\'t deny that wars will continue to happen due to lack of human intelligence. But that is not the case I am making. I am saying it could have and should have never happened in the first place. There is potential for us all to come to terms peacefully, and while there is that possibility there is reality. My views are optimistically realistic. I can see the better parts of man and know that we can do it. So none of my claims are preposterous, just highly unlikely. As far as they can apply to the real world I know that they will probably never come into action in the real world. But again, this is not my stance. My stance is about what should and could happen. That is what War is singing about. He is not saying war will never happen, he\\'s jus saying they shouldn\\'t. On this point it seems you agree with me, thus making my stance victorious. But now to discuss your point that they have no ability to ever stop. In summary, it seems your concerns are: Honor, intelligence, ignorance and one sided-ness. Honor: In concerns to the Scot and Tommy. What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive. Honor is a made up human concept, and can easily be restored with counseling. The only judge on honor is yourself, no one and nothing else\\'s. So, is fighting a war based on rape a good idea? Does it make the war just? No, it does not. It would still have been better for the Scots to have engaged in a peaceful negotiation. It would have been better for Tommy to call on the cops and let them suffer in a concrete room. The only accomplishment they made was gaining revenge, another self induced concept. Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself. So this is not a good reason to continue fighting wars. SO your lyric should not read \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man\", but rather \\'Sometimes you wanna fight when your a man\\'. Intelligence: You claim that people, both now and then, do not have the mental capacity to settle things peacefully. This is half-true, I can\\'t deny that. Never the less, they still have some modicum of intelligence to see that life is better than death. So even in the most unintelligent leader, they still have the ability, just not the will. It is still not an excuse, only an observation. But we all do have the ability to raise the intelligence of man kind, low as it is today. The budget on the War on Terror currently is in the trillions. Do you have any idea how many new schools could be constructed with that financing. I\\'m not talking about a lot of little \\'podunk\\' badly constructed schools. This kind of money could build thousands of university level institutions. It could re-furnish every American school twice over with new books, new desks, new computers, new everything with cash to spare. Yet it all goes to bullets, bombs, missiles and the things that fire them. All of these are good to only use a few times, but a school can last generations. So intelligence is not totally out of the question. Yes, right now human brain poser is less than satisfactory. True, the mental states of people in the past were less than a modern middle schooler. Yet we in the here and now have the ability to stop further destruction. We can teach those who will live beyond us the folly\\'s of the past, and make war nothing more than a definition in a text book they will read. So low intelligence is not an excuse either, only an obstacle. Ignorance: True, there are some people who will not change their blood thirsty ideals until they\\'ve been released of their own mortal coil. But that can all be solved with education, as stated above. People only know as much as they are taught. Right now, people are being taught to distrust their fellow man. They learn that they \\'other side\\' only wants you dead, and that you need to wan them dead more to stay alive. People just need to start teaching acceptance of \\'the enemy\\', because once your enemy is your friend, you have no enemies to fight against. Because this can also be avoided, this is also not a reason why wars should be fought. One sided-ness: A misconception you seem to have is that only one side should turn the other cheek while the other will continue to slap. This is not what I am saying. Both sides need to stop the violence, and can. War is a double edged sword. You cannot just sheath one side for it to no longer be a threat. Both sides must go into sheath. Both sides have the capabilities to stop war, thus both are accountable. Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end. Both sides need to stop war before it happens. As Riley of the Boondocks once said: If you don\\'t start nothing, there won\\'t be nothing. The same is true when it comes to war. In V for Vendetta, the British Government shouldn\\'t have take the peoples rights, and Evy wouldn\\'t have needed to be tortured by V because V would have nothing to fight against. My stance is that wars are good for absolutely nothing. I have proved that to be true. We can avoid war. Because we can we should. Continuing to do so just idiotic. There is no dispute that can only be settled with violence, people only think it is. Every obstacle can be overcome with learning, with understanding, with compassion. It is not mere optimism that fuels what I say, its the examination of other, more profitable routes we can take. My stance isn\\'t just a sermon, it is a presentation of possibilities and facts. Basically a science. There is as much realism to my points as there was for the idea\\'s of flight and electricity. Right now, war is equivalent to the ideas that the only manner\\'s of transportation will ever be horse drawn buggies and that candle light is the only way to see in the dark. The only difference, and I do mean the only, is that instead of one man making this brilliant proposition and then the world accepts it is that everyone in the world must be apart of the proposition and accept it. War is a global disease, and must be handled on a global level. Undeniably war has happened. Undeniably it has had some positive effects. But in every case it did not need to be settled by war and could have been solved with non-deadly words. Thus war has never accomplished anything that couldn\\'t have been done some other way. Therefore they are good for absolutely nothing. To GaryBacon: Good debate. You\\'ve challenged me with your historical knowledge. I\\'m also impressed with your V for Vendetta analogy. Also, out of curiosity, what is your picture of? I\\'ve been trying to figure that out for some time now. To the audience: I\\'ll remind you that your voting is not determined by what stance you prefer but which side proved theirs better, be it mine or GaryBacon\\'s. If you feel the need to justify your anonymous vote you can do so in the comments area. Darth_Grievous_42 out.', 'Well thank you for that compliment. I must agree with Logical-Master, and I too would have been quite amused if you had found a rebuttal song. But back on subject. On Necessity: While I cannot refute that wars have served a purpose, I have to disagree that that makes them necessary. What happened to politics? Is it always necessary to result to fisticuffs when you don\\'t get your way? Is there no way that talking it through could not have solved anything? You might say no but I say yes. What you will say is that nothing would have been accomplished. The French would still be poverty. Scots would never have had freedom. Zulus would have lost their land. That is, of course, assuming both sides had engaged in combat. Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past. The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory. We can see it now, why couldn\\'t they? Did it really take all those lives, all the wounds, all the nightmares to figure that out? The truth is they could have without war, but were blinded by the manipulations of their past. The common law was if you needed something take it, by any means necessary. Everybody viewed everybody as an enemy, as something less than themselves, as different. But really, are we different at all? Did the Zulu\\'s not have 5 fingers on their hands like the British? Didn\\'t the British have two legs like the Zulu\\'s? Didn\\'t both sides of the French have kidneys, Livers, Lower Intestine, Bladders, Femurs, Molars, Eyebrows, Rib cages, etc? Was there no possible way that neither side could see that? Why neither could treat the other as friend rather than foe? All the examples you have stated so far are all situations were reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine. Its wasn\\'t self defence, it was close minded fear. People wanted results fast, not results right. Either way it could have reached the same outcome. So again, what was the use of war? \"Because it means destruction of innocent lives\" You claim that people have to fight to better there lives. Well, as I just pointed out, all it would take is reason and even the strife could have been avoided. The poor conditions of the people were caused by ignorance, and selfishness of those in power. With enough political involvement, these tyrants could have been userbed without deadly force. With a bit of consciousness, peoples lives could be better. Again, human stupidity stalls that. So another case were it could have been avoided, but rather than efficiency, people wanted speed and money. So these lives were still lost needlessly. \"War means tears to thousands of mothers eyes when their sons go to fight and lose their lives\" Can there really be any good fight? Its not just one mother, its thousands, even millions, and not just those on the \"good\" side but on the other as well (a good exemplification of this is the film \\'All Quiet on the Western Front\\') To both sides, their \\'good\\' fight is the bad one for the opposition. Many don\\'t even know why they are fighting, they just are. Especially when a draft comes into effect, and people who would rather not fight, die for a cause they didn\\'t support or did not want to get involved in. Do you still think \\'the good fight\\' would matter to those mothers? \"War, it ain\\'t nothing but a heart breaker\" War is still a heart breaker, even to the oppressed. No sane person smiles when they hear of a loved ones death on the battlefield, even if it was for a cause. A cause which could be solved with diplomacy. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" Couldn\\'t those corrupt coalitionists be seen as undertakers? Profiting off the dead? I believe War meant \\'undertaker\\' as general statement. But there is no doubt that war must be a happy time for funeral businesses. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" Incorrect. All mankind view war as an enemy. What people like is the \\'reasons\\' behind the wars. War is an enemy to the human race. It\\'s purposeful self destruction of our species, aka, murder. We are legally endorsing the job that we condemn people like Charles Mason and Timothy McVeigh for doing. A B52 pilot can easily beat the damage done in the Oklahoma City Bombing. A Marine can kill ten times more than Charles Mason. Why is it that no one else seems to see that war=murder. That is War is saying. We are killing ourselves. Reasons be damned. Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death. Without the reasoning its still murder. And because the reasoning can be resolved some other way. So we are killing ourselves needlessly! War is an enemy to everyone, no matter what story you tell yourself to sleep at night. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Give me a good reason to start a war. This means that reason could not, in any way, be resolved peacefully. There would have to be a good, legitimate reason that would progress mankind. There cannot be any ill will, or vengeful motivation behind it. All of these are in direct conflict with what war really is. But if you can find me 1 \\'good\\' war I will concede this point. I would suggest trying to find a few, as I\\'m sure I will be able to knock them down easily. \"War has caused unrest within the younger generation\" War messes everybody up. The father of a son dies. The sun wells up hatred. That son becomes a world leader, and declares war. That war kills another dad, with another son, and the cycle continues. War only fuels distrust, hatred, and revenge. It hinders progress because it scars people, physically, mentally and emotionally. The only reason its still alive is because we keep it alive, and say it\\'s right. Patriotism is just a nice sound way of saying \"I will kill anyone for this dirt\". Allegiance and loyalty are just the politically correct term of saying \"I don\\'t trust my fellow man\". War is bad, and always will be. \"Induction then destruction\" Destruction is always bad. It means death. Many people view death as being a bad thing. Again, diplomacy can spare us all the trouble. \"Who wants to die?\" An escape for a temporary situation. Nothing that can\\'t be solved with reason. In fact, many survivors of suicide come to that same realization. Life is precious, why stop it prematurely? I\\'m sure if we could talk to those dead in wars they would say the exact same thing. Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice? \"Ooooh, war, has shattered many a young mans dreams, made him disabled, bitter and mean\" So you concede to this point for the most part. Every surviving soldier I have met from a war is haunted with bad dreams and memories. Those with disabilities are loathsome of the cause. They lost their hand because two leaders could not shake theirs. Truly a waste. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past. If we do fight any in the future (undoubtedly we will) it will only be because we still haven\\'t realized this fact. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" The opposite of war isn\\'t peace, it\\'s creation. Wars destroy, people create. You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy. The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step? \"Peace, love and understanding tell me, is there no place for them today?\" But war is still evil, yes? What would be so wrong about getting people to understand each other? It would take time, perhaps some harsh words here and there, but any positive result that doesn\\'t require a gun is worth looking into. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom but Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" Diplomacy. Education. Reason. Understanding. LOVE. Just a thought. 22 Characters left.', 'As Pro, I am going to be defending that war (the fighting killing kind) is good for absolutly nothing.

You cannot legally leave slaveryPeople dont voluntarily pay taxes but people do understand that the government has the right to collect taxes and use those taxes to pay for services to help the people.

There are laws to regulate government agencies to keep their power in check at a certain amount or laws to maintain how ethical their actions are. Governments uphold laws in ways such that the unalienable rights of people are not violated and government corporations that do break laws are liable to penalties because the government is not all powerful and immune. That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass, they do not use intimidation and violence as law enforcement, and because things such as taxes are involuntary but are accepted as necessary evils by people. Now then here are a list of governments that are not criminal organizations. The Monarchy in NarniaThe government of Panem (Hunger Games)The Ministry of Magic (Harry Potter)The Volturi (Twilight)The government of Danistann (Nationstates.org)Those governments are not criminal organizations because even though they create laws and enforce them, have rights over a region, and collect taxes, they are fictional governments and thus are not criminal organizations even though they count as governments.', 'I will be doing this by justifying what it is governments are actually meant to do and give examples of governments that are 100% NOT criminal organizations as defined by the Pro.', 'Pros comparisons of governments and the Mafia - Ability to make laws - \" mob boss\\'s rules are the rules and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the mafia\\'s. \" But people dont recognize the Mafia Boss as the legitimate law maker of their land, people on the other hand do recognize governments as legit law makers, meaning that governments are not criminal organizations since they are legally recognized by the people as the lawmakers. - Rights given to people - \"Neither do governments. When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\"\"Ok then allow me to rephrase. Governments establish that it cannot violate the rights of people. The Mafia does not do that. Therefore a government is not a criminal organization since it establishes that a persons rights cannot be violated. - Consequences for violating laws - \" If you give it to me and I don\\'t shoot you, is it then OK? \"Youve made the correct choice in that scenario, however as stated above, the Government can only give you choices for punishment that do not violate a persons established right, the Mafia doesnt do that. Therefore a government is not a criminal organization since it can only give punishments that do not infringe on a persons rights. - Crossing state lines - \"the mob can kick you out of the ciy is if you\\'re a trouble-maker\"But as established before, the mafia isnt the recognized authority of the land and are not the official lawmakers of the land.

A government cannot use extreme measures of force because peoples rights defend from that, however to criminal organizations rights dont mean anything and there is an unlimited range of force they can use. Therefore Governments are not criminal organizations since the range of force a government can use against its people through law enforcement is limited, whereas for criminal organizations, it is not. - Legitimacy to collect taxes - \"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money\"Once again, people dont recognize the mafia as the legal entity that can collect taxes, the government though is. Therefore governments arent criminal organizations since people recognize governments to have the power to collect taxes legally, but criminal organizations do not. ========================================================================================================================================================Governments vs Anarchies - Governments give people rights - \"Rights are \"unalienable\".

For ALL governments to be criminal organizations you must prove that all governments are criminal organizations.

Pro is a die hard anarchist who probably believes that making your kid go to school counts as child abuse and absolutely refuses to acknowledge anything good the government has ever done. I am arguing that since governments provide services to people, give rights to people, protect and acknowledge people\\'s rights, repeal laws that are found to be unjust, give rights to people even when they are criminals, and passes laws that benefit people when they do not benefit the government. Governments are not criminal organizations, and by extension just because one government crosses the line one time that certainly does not mean that all governments are somehow all criminal organizations because the Pro has still yet to offer evidence of just how each and every last government is a criminal organization. Fictional or not', 'I will be using the term \"corporation\" to refer to organizations and institutions which may or may not meet the criteria of \"government\", as the term \"corporation\" literally means a \"body of people\". This can include any type of corporation - municipalities, nation-states, for-profit, non-profit, state-chartered, etc... (ie, all governments are corporations, but not all corporations are governments). This is to more easily compare institutions which do not meet the definitions above, and to clearly demonstrate the myth of legitimacy, and the problem with arbitrary exemptions. Also, If you have an example of a corporation which meets the criteria provided, please provide these examples in the early rounds, so that I may address them. At the very least, I would request that no examples be provided in the last round, as that would not leave me the opportunity to address anything I find to be incorrect.Please do not confuse \"society\" with \"government\". Before I begin, I would like to state that I accept the necessity of society, community, and of many of the services that these corporations labeled as \"government\" provide. If a corporation issues a \"law\", it is making a rule and promoting the obedience of that rule with \"law enforcement\" (both attributes are listed in the definition of government that we have accepted for this debate). Law enforcement is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of the goal of obedience. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:The use of violence an intimidation, without arbitrary exemptions, is the core principle behind criminal law. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression.If a corporation claims a \"monopoly right over a geographic area\", it is claiming that, on some level, it \"owns\" the land, and, if you move past a claimed boundary on the earth, the corporation claims the \"right\" to use the above-mentioned violence and intimidation in the pursuit of its goals. We can also not call being born into a geographical area as \"consent\" or acceptance of the legitimacy of that claim any more than being born into slavery is consent to being a slave.The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:Claiming a monopoly right is inherently an exemption. It is the statement that the corporation can engage in X, but any other corporation who engages in X on their \"turf\" is subject to the same violence and intimidation described earlier. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression, racketeering, or uphold the property rights of individuals.If a corporation collects \"taxes\", we must assume that it is not voluntary. Any \"voluntary\" payment of services would simply be called a payment, and any \"voluntary\" contribution to society would simply be called \"charity\". Taxation is based exclusively on where you reside or do business, ie, if you reside or do business within the geographic area that the institution claim, this amounts to \"tacit consent\" (ie, not consensual) to pay for products and services. We can not accept this as \"voluntary\" because people choose to stay in that geographic region any more than we can accept the Mafia\\'s collection of \"protection money\" as voluntary simply because a shopkeeper chooses not to move out of the neighborhood. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:To take, under threat of force, the product of somebody else\\'s labor, against their consent is \"theft\". To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting theft.The myth of legitimacy and the paradox of exemption:The core difference between \\'government\\' corporations and other corporations is the idea that these claims are somehow \"legitimate\", ie, that other corporations can not do these things without being in violation of the law, but institutions which are perceived as \\'legitimate\", or labeled as \"government\", can do these things without being in violation of the law. The myth of \"legitimacy\" is itself an example of \"arbitrary exemptions\". In essence, it is a matter of faith. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to use violence against you or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to take the product of your labor against your will or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has a legitimate claim to a geographical area or you do not, but the claim itself does not make it true, and the fact that this belief is held by so many also does not make it true (democracy itself is an appeal to the ad populum fallacy).In fact, faith is REQUIRED to accept such corporations as legitimate, because, as I have demonstrated, the attributes of these corporations are inherently inconsistent (ie, self-contradictory), and a concept must, at the very least, be internally consistent for it to qualify as \\'legitimate\\'.', 'This argument contains definitions which clarify my position. If you provide an example of a corporation, agency, institution or other body which does not meet the below criteria (ei, at least one of the three attributes listed are not present), or define \"crime\" as excplicitly including \"arbitrary exemptions\" (ie, a \"law\" that allows the state to violate other laws), then you are arguing against a straw man, EVEN IF such institution is accepted as a \"government\" using OTHER CRITERIA. When I am using the word \"government\", I am describing any number of institutions, with variations in size, scope, complexity, culture, laws, and location. However, I assert that all of these institutions have very specific characteristics in common, which I will sum up into three behavioral attributes: The creation of Laws and Law enforcement. The claim of monopoly rights over a geographic area. The collection of taxes. While there are many variations of structure and organization of such institutions, I will use these attributes to define government. Something labeled a \"government\" may not meet this criteria, and is therefor exempt from this . I define \"Criminal Organization\" as any organization which inherently commits crimes. Here, \"crime\" means a violation of applicable criminal law (if applied consistently to all moral actors regardless of arbitrary exemptions giving members of that organization the exclusive right to commit such crime). I contend that it is axiomatic - that the very same attributes which I here use to define a government are crimes, even within the scope of the very same laws that same government provides and enforces, and that arbitrary excemptions are necessary to cover up this obvious inconsistency.', 'For this round, will simply test con\\'s arguments out by using the same arguments for a known criminal institution as a baseline - the question is \"does the same line of argument justify the actions of the mafia?\". Since we know the actions of the mafia are not justifible or legitimate, we can assume any argument which justfies or legitimizes the criminal actions of the mafia are not valid. For this thought experiment, I will assume that the mob boss makes sizable donations to the orphanage he was raised in. Think of the orphans\"First off a law is a law and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the governments.\" First off a mob boss\\'s rules are the rules and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the mafia\\'s. You must first assume that the rules are legitimate before you can assume that the violence used to enforce those rules is justified. This is circular reasoning.\"criminal organizations dont give people rights\"Neither do governments. When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\", buy any right that isn\\'t codified is on the table, hence the state violating your property rights and rights of movement.\\'Yeah if asking nicely and giving you an option to choose youre own fate is counted as violence\\'If the mafia asks you nicely and gives you an option to choose whether you pay protection, aren\\'t you choosing you\\'re own fate?

The reason the mob can kick you out of the ciy is if you\\'re a trouble-maker. If you don\\'t make any trouble, and keep your nose clean, you don\\'t got nothing to worry about.\"You cannot assume that [all governments are criminal organizations] just because 1 might qualify that all others do qualify.\"Like I said before, based on the definition of \\'crime\\', exluding any exeptions, all governments, as defined in this argument, are, de-facto, criminal organizations. It is axiomatic, like saying \"all apples are fruits\", and defining an apple as a \"fruit which grows on an apple tree\". The criteria for criminality explicitly includes the qualities specifically defined in government.\"You have yet to give proof that they are indeed criminal organizations.\"If these fictional governments have fictional laws which are enforced with fictional law enforcement and claim a monopoly over fictional geographic regions and collect fictional taxes, then they are fictional criminal organizations, unless you define \"crime\" as \"not crime\" or \"not crime when fictional governments do it\".\"Law enforcement still acknowledges that people have rights, that law enforcement is limited in how they treat people, and that law enforcement lives by codes and laws that they have to obey.\"The mob knows that people deserve respect, and there are certain things that they just won\\'t do. You treat them right, and they\\'ll treat you right. There\\'s even \"honor among theves\".\"for a government to work it needs taxes\"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money. Think of the orphans.\"you have still not offered evidence showing that each and every one of these are criminal organizations. \"You are shifting the onus. In essence, you are stating that I must deliver an infinite number of counter-arguments to these examples. You are doing this because, I suspect, you don\\'t understand the axiomatic nature of my argument. My argument works with all possible governments in all possible universes, as long as they meet the criteria.You have asserted several times that I have offered \"no proof\" that governments are criminal organizations. To say this is to miss the point etirely. If I say that all apples are fruits and define apple as a fruit, then, yes, ALL apples are fruits, definately and definitively. You are saying that there are fictional apples, and put the onus on me to prove that all fictional apples are fruits, when you ignore the definition of \"apple\" stated to avoid exactly that kind of confusion.The rest of your argument is a repetition of the same points - \"yeah, but...\". Yeah, but governments pay for good things. Yeah, but governments punish bad people. Yeah, but governments give us free goodies. Yeah, but governments protect us from evil warlords. This may all be entirely true, but it is also irrelevant, as I am not saying that providing these services is a criminal act any more than the mob boss giving money to an orphanage is a criminal act. It\\'s not what they do with their money and power (most of the time), it\\'s how they get the money, and how they keep their power. You also choose to argue against some of my rhetorical statements I made during the round you forfieted. I could engage in those extraneous argument, but it would take too long and detract from the point.Your final diatribe against anarchism is an ad hominum attack. Yes, I\\'m an \"anarchist\" because I don\\'t believe in morally justifiable INITIATIONS of force. Just calling me an \"anarchist\" is a de-facto straw man since you obviously have a misunderstanding of my position, so can not possibly address my arguments which defend them. I could be a satanist, child-molesting drug-dealing murderous psychopath, but that wouldn\\'t change the substance of my argument.\"Governments give people rights\"Rights are \"unalienable\".

So the government does spend money on EVERYONE', 'When the world was confronted with the observations of Copernicus, and the theories of a heliocentric solar system, it was a dramatic shock to the existing world view that the entire world would be fundamentally different than what people had accepted for centuries.When the world was confronted with the protestant movement, it was a dramatic charge that the \"one true faith\" could be called into question, that alternatives to such a ubiquitous and powerful institution could be created simply by asking those questions, and formulating alternative answers.When the world was confronted with abolitionists, it was a dramatic realization that slavery was wrong, yet some stuck to their existing perceptions, and ignored the obvious immorality of the institution.When the world was confronted with the woman\\'s suffrage movement, it was a dramatic and scary thought to some that women be given the same rights as men.When the world was confronted with such scientific breakthroughs as the theory of evolution, or Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, it was a dramatic paradigm shift, which left many people dazed and confused.Yet, we all accept that these things were correct, and the dominant paradigms of the time were wrong. We all accept that truth marches on, and that the future MUST, as well, be filled with surprising revelations about the ideas and institutions we take for granted.Is it really hard to accept that the next to be called into question is the dominant institution of our day? Is it really that far of a stretch to think that institutions (governments) which killed nearly 300 million people in the 20th century may not be rational? Is it really hard to accept that using an institution which steals nearly half the nation\\'s income is not a good strategy for protecting property rights? Is it hard to figure out that the more soldiers \"fight for our freedom\", the less freedom we actually have, as measured by the massive amount of legislation coming out of Washington, from SOPA and PIPA to the NDAA and the Patriot Act?We can either choose to be on the right side of history, or we can choose to indulge in the delusion that the status quo is always correct - a delusion that, history has shown, will almost always be wrong.', '\"law enforcement coming from the government comes in the forms of fines, penalties, and maybe an arrest if the crimes are severe enough.\"There are many different forms of \"punishment\" for non-obedience, up to and including being shot. The violence, however, tends to show itself clearly only when the other intimidation techniques don\\'t achieve the objective of your obedience. In the US, for instance, you may get a fine, but that fine is essentially an extortion notice, and is itself an act of intimidation. You must pay, or else. If you do not pay that fine, they can increase the intimidation. For instance, they can send you a court date, which is to say, they can demand that you appear before them. If you do not show up, they can issue a warrant for your arrest, which is to say, they create a document which \"authorizes\" somebody to abduct you against your will. Even that is nice language meant to play down what actually happens, as the truth, at least in the US, is that men with guns come to your house, tie you up in metal shackles, throw you in a vehicle, many times a windowless van, and toss you in a cage that is famous for being a place where you will be beaten and raped*.If you defend yourself from this horrific threat of abduction and prison rape, you will be shot - murdered, slaughtered, executed, put down like a pig, and the only \"crimes\" you committed were disobedience and self-defense.\"law enforcement doesn\\'t come from violence and intimidation\"Law enforcement IS violence and intimidation, and it is explicitly so. There are plenty of justifications for this violence and intimidation, (ie, claiming that it is a \"necessary evil\"), but saying they have nothing to do with each other is like saying war has nothing to do with killing people. Not only is it not true, it is the exact opposite of truth. \"You are allowed to move beyond boundaries between governments though, they are called passports and it happens all the time. \"You are contradicting yourself. If I am required to ask permission to do something (passport), then, ipso-facto, I am not \"allowed\" to do it. The idea that I would be \"allowed\" to move beyond those borders with permission implicitly asserts that the corporation has the right to deny me access, which is the exact opposite of me being \"allowed\" to cross those borders. Let\\'s say you didn\\'t even need a passport, and you could just freely move across borders - that is irrelevant to the question of how the corporation behaves within those borders. Building walls and having checkpoints on the borders is just one more example of criminal behavior on the part of these corporations. Much like \"taxation\", it is something that, if you or I attempted to do to a third party, it would immediately be recognized as criminal behavior.\"So taxes may be involuntary, but they are a necessary evil\"Whether you believe it is \"necessary\" is irrelevant. It has been argued that the black market is \"necessary\", as well, but that is irrelevant to whether it is criminal. Slavery was once thought of as a \"necessary evil\", but that doesn\\'t change the nature of slavery.Also, you forget that it is not \"the people\" government spends money on, as there is no such thing as \\'the people\". The government takes money from SOME people and uses it to benefit OTHER people. The size of the groups involved are irrelevant. For instance, not all people agree with you that taxes are \"accepted as necessary evils\".Even if that money was spent to improve society, and that 99.99% of the population approves of the spending, it is still a violation of the law unless we allow for an exemption - you even admit this yourself by calling taxation a necessary \"evil\". What is \"evil\" about being consistent with our values and rules? For us to consider it \"evil\", it must be a violation of our value system.\" That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass\"...except the ones that have exemptions that allow them to violate the law, which, I still maintain, is all of them. I freely acknowledge that government agencies and individuals working for government are subject to some of the laws that the rest of us are. However, a criminal is still a criminal if he breaks even one criminal law, regardless of how many laws he obeys. If that criminal could decide what the laws are, there is no reason for him to give himself an exemption for laws he doesn\\'t want to violate - just the ones preventing stealing, intimidation, racketeering, etc... just like governments do.\"Those governments are not criminal organizations because even though they create laws and enforce them, have rights over a region, and collect taxes, they are fictional governments and thus are not criminal organizations even though they count as governments.\"There are many fictional crime families out there. To the extent that they are fictional, their crimes are fictional, but that doesn\\'t change the fact that they are criminal. What you are essentially saying:In order to argue your case, you have done the following: Claimed that law enforcement (law enFORCEment) has nothing to do with force, violence, or intimidation, even though the exact opposite is demonstrably true. Claimed that taxation is a \"special case\" because \"the people\" (ie, you, and people who agree with you) consider it a \\'necessary evil\\'. In other words, it is exempt from our standards and is \"legal\" even though it violates other laws - exactly my point. Used fictional (FICTIONAL!) governments as examples of governments which are not criminal (even though they still are criminal as fictional governments). In short, you have produced no compelling reasons to dismiss my arguments. * http://reason.com...', 'There are a few things I need to bring up this round. 1) My opponent makes the claim that the music is terrible, however, he does not provide any evidence for this claim, not even a sample of the music for us to make the determination.

I hope for a good debate.I thank you.\", 'Hello, Fred. This is one of my favorite subjects, and I am glad to have this debate with you. The photons emitting from my computer screen have triggered a complicated cause and effect, resulting in me accepting the challenge. I would like to start off by establishing what free will is. We are discussing the theoretical ability of the mind to make decisions of its own, and to control its own fate. I would now like to speculate on the nature of a mind. Its home is the brain. The brain is a physical object, which acts like any other physical object. Chemical reactions occur within it, which makes our \"decisions\" and \"thoughts\". You will refute by saying that we control our decisions. If you see a plate of food in front of you would eat it, right? If there was no plate of food there, would you have still made the decision to eat it? No. Of course not, several things, including the smell of the food, and your vision that reveals the food, CAUSED you to eat it. The brain is such an endlessly complex thing, but it still follows rules and cause and effect just like anything else. The nature of this speculation is incredible, as it is that of a brain pondering on the workings of it. We can, of course, never fully understand and predict the complex chemical reactions of a brain. Because we may not predict it, we assume it controls its own fate. The same may be applied to the rolling of a die. No man can predict what number it will land on when tossed across a game- board. We perceive it to be random. Though it is obvious that it is not random, and the die still follows the laws of physics, and every little crumb on the table that the die comes across, causes the die to make a slightly different course. Let\\'s look back to history, shall we? In the very early ages, before science, people would perceive that things such as rain were the will of gods, and would dance and what not for rain. Of course none of them could perceive of water being held in clouds, evaporation or what not, so they assume that the rain has a will of its own. In our advanced era, we know that rain is caused by a predictable system of cause and effect. How is our brain any different? I have no wish to turn this into a theological debate, for I am an atheist. I will note however, that there is in fact, theological determinism. You should look it up. It is the belief that god controls the actions of Humans. wrote more ethic and sci can post round 1 or in comments. prefference?', 'Hello, In actuality, what is later discovered to be invalid was in fact invalid from the start, but this is irrelevant. Instinct and what you perceive to be \"rational thought\" (but what is really just extremely complex cause and effect which appear to be rational) are deeply intermingled. No, you either did do as I proposed, or you didn\\'t, and to the fortune of your co-workers you did the latter. It is not as if you \"could\" have done something else. At the time, I could not predict the future (My mind did not know all the variables), and thus was not positive which crossroad events would inevitably take, and it may have been perceived by some, that it was random, or that events chose the crossroad. But now, that we can look back to the past (based on memory) and observe the outcome, we can reasonably conclude that the equation could only add up to your un-compliance with my friendly suggestion. Let me explain this mathematically: We will use a simple equation for this experiment, quite unlike the complex equations of the mind. The equation is: 2+3. We, in this context, know all variables involved: 2 and 3. Using our knowledge of all the variables in question, and our mind\\'s amazing computing ability, we can predict the future and say it will equal 5. This is a much simplified version, however. In reality, being the humans with oh so limited minds; we would NOT know all the variables. Let\\'s say that we only knew the existence of 2. We would not know what all variables might be included, so estimates of the results could be any figure. We cannot predict the outcome with the limited info. After the thing itself happened, and we observed that it was 5 that ended up happening, we know that it could not have been anything else that was the answer, for 2+3, despite your philosophies WILL ALWAYS equal 5. According to your ideas, 2+3, could \"choose\" to equal 7, or 10, or 23,476,353,658,346. This is obviously untrue. Series of events, in actuality follow one path, there are no crossroads; the crossroads are just illusions. And this is the easiest answer to the question of free will, and we may conclude that free-will does not exist. The mind does not control math. Math is undisputable. You cannot deny the logic I have provided above. To answer your question, 2 and 3 force you to choose something. The matter of free-will is not about forcing to do something against your will; it is about forcing your will to do whatever. It makes you \"choose\" what you choose. I have proved that the mind is not infinite, but 2+3 cannot equal an infinite amount of things, it can only equal one thing. If it was infinite, my mind could control the universe (and trust me, if I controlled the universe, things would be a lot more amusing). The computer is indeed a good analogy for the brain, because the computer, like the brain, has no free will. Your analogy seems to agree with my side. Anyways, I suppose it would be \"possible\", as in we don\\'t know for sure any variables that deny it, but I strongly doubt that the equation of events will equal humans building such a computer. There are many variables including even such things as the human race being wiped out before we reached the level of technology. AS for your differentiation between Humans and other animals, I say: a brain is a brain, brains don\\'t have freewill. Look at this article: http://www.apa.org... It shows how similar human and chimpanzee brains are. You earlier proposed a sort of \"micro evolution\", evolution takes millions of years, Fred. So we can reasonably look back…6 thousand years and conclude that human\\'s brains are not dissimilar from humans. Infants born and raised today constantly are raised in the environment of the information age. The minds of 6 thousand years ago, which we can conclude are basically the same as now, lived as animals, so I do not see your connection. Fred, I am dearly sorry, but I can not explain to you all the variables involved in the decisions and psychological processes of gamblers, and drunkards. You keep asking for a simple explanation of why the gambler does something, and someone else does another thing, but I can\\'t give a simple explanation of these processes. Those statements do not necessarily disagree with my arguments. Brain tissue can change shape. You CANT defy nature, Fred. Nature is to broad a sense. Nature is simply the nature of how things are, how they work and why they exist in such a form. You\\'re brain cells do not choose in what direction they go, or how they multiply. You drastically misunderstood my last paragraph (not your fault, just the confusion of limited man-made language). I was not complaining that you were asking \"why\" to much, I was complaining that you WERE NOT asking \"why\" enough, I think that you are not asking \"Why\" enough. I want you to ask \"why\" more. Does it make sense to you now? -Harlan', 'Hello Science itself, by definition can not be mistaken, while scientific theories can be disproved (thus eliminating the \"Science\" element of it). The idea that people use free will to decide whether they want free will is ludicrous (it is like saying, \"vote no if you don\\'t want democracy\"). A thought can certainly cause another thought to form. All a \"thought\" is, is the complex-calculator-that-is-the-mind\\'s process that you are aware of. Assuming that you were \"sane\" (a relevant term, mind you), my mind concluded that you would not be able to carry out my thoughtful suggestion. I was right. You could not do it. Your mind kept you from doing it. \"While I could very well choose to do any of those things that you suggest, I would more than likely choose not to do them\" You \"could\" have done them? If our world fo0llows cause and vent, I was aware that if something in the past did or did not happen, there was no other possible course of events, as there is no such thing as randomness. You \"more than likely\" would have done what you did? Things are not random, Fred. Things only happen if things cause them to happen. Are you saying that the mind has infinite possibilities? This is obviously not true…the mind is limited at some point. Do not get me wrong, the Human mind has a very complex system for deciding courses of action, but not infinite. Well, it depends what you mean by \"infinite\", for inside the number 1, there is an infinite amount of variations (1.1, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, 1.00001, 1.000001, 1.132432543246322542523) The mind is not capable of everything, though. Theoretically, the human mind could be predicted, but because of the chaos theory, it would be INCREDIBLY difficult, but once more, the Human mind is not capable of everything, and it would take well over a lifetime (WELL, well over) to factor in and understand all the variables in the universe, for one moment in time. I doubt that we will create a computer if such computing power, because where would we get all the information? You can not fit a universe in a computer. Way, way too much information. It is probably not something we could do. Though strictly theoretically, it is \"possible\". How could I make the assertion that you would not do the actions I asked of you to take? Of course I did not know all the variables of the Universe, and thus I was not sure, but I knew that few minds were allowed to work in this manner, though some might be forced to. I do not believe in such a thing as a god \"investing\" free will in someone (side-note: who put the freewill in the god?). While we are in a scientific debate, you must agree that a Human is an animal. You stated yourself: \"animals do not have free will\". Do you concede, then? Or do you take that back? Or would you make the argument that scientifically Humans are not animals (which is unfactual)? Or do you revise that statement to say: \"animals, exempt Humans, do not have freewill\". I would be OK with this. Though our brains work the exact same way as other animals. The purpose of quoting Einstein was that not only does he have great understanding of things, and would be a great person for input, he summed it up very nicely. God does not play dice indeed, and accordingly nothing is random or happening for no reason, thus there being no freewill. Since we are debating with the context of science, the scientific world is a logical one. In this world (our world) things happen because things made them happen, not because they decide to happen. No offense, but I don\\'t think you\\'re going deep enough, Fred. You must keep asking \"why\" on every aspect. WHY do we do this? WHY does our mind decide that? WHAT made it decide that? WHY did it make it decide that? Things happen for reasons. You are just floating on the surface when you say that the mind has memories, but somehow those brain cells decide their own fate. You need to delve, and try to find the reason for each and every aspect. And therein lies the answer, everything has a reason, and thus the brain cells cannot decide their own fate. -Harlan', 'This topic has been discussed since the earliest of times and involves religious, ethical, and scientific implications. In the realm of theology, the Creator does not assert His omnipotent power over individual will thereby allowing humans to make choices. On an ethical plane, without free will, how can we hold anyone morally accountable for their actions. While great strides have been made in scientifically mapping the thought process, the actions of the body are not wholly determined by physical causality. The question is: Does the machine (brain) control the soul or does the soul control the machine? In contemplating on whether or not to issue this challenge, I weighed all of the options and possibilities (consequences) of my contemplated action and decided to go ahead and issue the challenge. My intention is not to win or loose the debate, but supply a forum where ideas can be freely exchanged in a refreshing, open atmosphere without rancor.', 'Harlan, the definition of science is:\" ability to produce solutions in some problem domain.\" It is a fact that solutions that were valid yesterday, may become invalid today based upon further research. Sometimes, the scientist comes to a conclusion based upon flawed data making his conclusion invalid – or a mistake. I don\\'t think I said people decide on whether or not they want free will. I do say that man has the ability to use free will, or he can choose not to thereby utilizing only that portion of his brain that responds to instinct, the reptilian brain. A thought certainly can form another thought. \"I think I will write a book,\" may produce another thought: \"What kind of book will I write?\" I am glad that you assumed that I am sane. In doing so you might have even placed a wager on my response because, being sane, why would I want to do things that are considered by most to be insane? The fact remains that I could have done some of those things you proposed (I once danced onstage acting like a stripper akin to wearing a pink tutu to work) but I considered the consequences and decided they were not things that I should do, especially at work! What would force me to do something that I choose not to do? I truly believe that the power of the mind is infinite. The more we use it, the better we get at doing things. Doesn\\'t it seem that each generation seems \"smarter\" than the previous ones? Perhaps we are observing a micro-second of evolution? When computers first were developed, they were the size of a room. Today, I am working on a minuscule laptop going at corvette speeds compared to the model T speed of the older ones. Computers will continually evolve into smarter, faster machines because someone decided to study and research computer technology and take it to the next level by experimentation. If it is theoretically possible, then it can be done…we just haven\\'t figured out how yet! Again, we will leave the origin of free will to the theological debate and remain in the scientific realm. Miriam-Webster defines human as \"of, relating to, or characteristic of humans: a: having human form or attributes b: susceptible to or representative of the sympathies and frailties of human nature.\" An example would be all Native Americans are Native Americans, but not all are Wampanoag Native Americans. Something sets them apart. While man may be described as a \"bi-pedal mammal\" something sets us apart from all other mammals: our ability to make decisions, to make choices, to exercise free will. We can ask the questions: \"Who? What? Why? What are the consequences? Then we can decide to act, or not act. I am an addict (alcohol being a drug)science tells me that I inherited a genetic makeup that made me so. Science can demonstrate that prolonged use of the drug causes further alterations within my brain chemistry. That makes sense. I took something that caused a change that effected my brain. However, a pathological gambler never ingests anything yet science shows the same brain chemistry changes as the alcoholic. But, the pathological gambler never ingested anything to cause the effect on the brain. His repetitive behavior (or, thinking)did. Sort of like mind over matter, wouldn\\'t you say? By doing certain things over and over again I have developed a newer habit (sobriety) that defies my genetic nature and the changes caused to my brain chemistry by continued use of the drug. Certainly not an easy feat but I haven\\'t had a drink in almost seven years. Defies nature, don\\'t you think? The fact is I first tried recovery back in 1998 but I only have seven years of \"clean time.\" Recovery didn\\'t work until I chose to do the things necessary to make it work despite my genetic makeup! I chose! Things (planets, trees, etc.) certainly do not make things work. I make things work by using my intellect and my freedom to choose what to make work. Perhaps, Harlan, my \"why\" questions are meant for you to think about my statements in a different way than you have in the past. Everything does have a reason but man has not been able to discover every reason just yet. Logical is defined as being \"capable of or reflecting the capability for correct and valid reasoning; a logical mind.\" Truth is, life can be illogical at times.']\n",

Firstly we should clarify what significance means: 1.a the state or quality of being significant1.b of consequence or importance==================================To respond directly to Pros argument first:he/she asserts that Australia invented 'amazing things' like 'WiFI, Google Maps, Polymer bank notes, Ultrasound scanners, stainless steel braces and many more things'. Now, if these inventions did come from Australia, then, it can be considered a 'significant country' - as a country which is the home of some of the most universally-used inventions in the 21st century. It would seem that Pro was/is trying to argue that Australia simply deserves more recognition, in which case he/she should proposed that instead of stating that it should be more 'significant' - because the examples that Pro themselves has listed, fully go against that. Instead of affirming the resolution, Pro has negated it. After all, insignificant countries do not invent things such as WiFi or Google Maps. One invention listed by Pro that I will take issue with though is the ultrasound, as this was not invented in Australia. Its first use is thought to have been in Austria, which is a country in Europe. Its technology developed from there. 'The use of ultrasound in medicine began during and shortly after the 2nd World War in various centres around the world. The work of Dr. Karl Theodore Dussik in Austria in 1942 on transmission ultrasound investigation of the brain provides the first published work on medical ultrasonics.'

But if a unfathomable God made the rules, It would only make sense that the standard would be harder, As we are not gods. * \"Regardless your god MURDERED 2, 821, 364 in YOUR bible, \" Again, You pull out a incredibly specific number (2, 821, 364) with no source. I ask you to back up these numbers in the future. Regardless, I do not believe that there is a verse you can pull up that cannot be justified. You have left two of my earlier points un-rebbuted, Instead choosing to simply rage quit. Regardless, I know in advance that the two us will never come to a agreement. I also know that the likelihood of me winning this debate is slim, As even a idiot could see that you are far better educated and experienced. If you do not want to continue this debate, Simply inform me. As always, I look forward to your response.', 'Here I am again, Knowing full well that it is likely you will best me. Regardless, I would be a disgrace to my religion if I did not try. I will try to rebut your points. I hope that I meet your criteria, But regardless if I do not I will debate to the best of my abilities. If you consider me non-intelligent (which is unfortunately likely), Please tell me upfront so I may leave the debate as respectively as I can. * Your first paragraph details how you believe that the bible is man made. However, Allow me to explain how your point is flawed. The outlandishness of the law is not proof that the bible is man-made, Quite the opposite. If God had simply told the Israelites a practical way to cure leprosy (chemically engineer dapsone), Then it would not be a miracle. However, If God chose the most outlandish set of instructions and the lepers were healed, Then Israel could not deny it was a miracle. This was needed because Israel had the habit of instantaneously following other gods that allowed them to have no rules or restrictions. * You are asking why God would forgive the murderer. As the old proverb goes, \"Blood leads to blood. Violence into more violence. Revenge is just another name for Murder\". You also forget that the man who was slain gains eternal riches in the next life. If that muderer continues to do evil, He will receive damnation * One: that verse was a parable. Here is a source explaining it https://www. Biblestudytools. Com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/matthew-19-12. Html. Two: even if it was not a parable, We are talking a God that created the laws of physics. Nothing is physically impossible * Here is a source explaining that verse: http://apologeticspress. Org/apcontent. Aspx? Category=6&article=301 *\"Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one Jesus? After all this Christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. \" Jesus was not sent to stop physical war on earth. Jesus was sent to stop the spiritual war that had been raging on since satan\\'s fall. Because the 80 years we live on this earth is a pittance compared to the 1000\\'s on 1000\\'s we live afterwards. As for those who started such wars without cause, They will be damned. Conclusion: I will not claim to have all knowledge. I will not claim to be the smartest in my nation or my religion or even of my family. However, Even a fool such as I know this. The bible, A book that is constantly under fire, Has managed to survive and flourish since 4000 b. C. In between then and now it has been threatened by some of the most powerful men in the world (ex. Adolf Hitler who aimed to burn all religious materials) and has survived. It has stood against the harshest critics including scientists, Philosophers, And historians all of whom failed to find deceisive evidence that the bible was false. And that seems like a miracle too me. Regardless, I thank you for your time']\n",

Leviticus 14:33-57 \"And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, Saying, 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, Which I give to you for a possession, And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, Saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, Before the priest go into it to see the plague, That all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: 37 And he shall look on the plague, And, Behold, If the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, Greenish or reddish, Which in sight are lower than the wall; 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, And shut up the house seven days: 39And the priest shall come again the seventh day, And shall look: and, Behold, If the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, And they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, And they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 42 And they shall take other stones, And put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, And shall plaister the house. 43 And if the plague come again, And break out in the house, After that he hath taken away the stones, And after he hath scraped the house, And after it is plaistered; 44 Then the priest shall come and look, And, Behold, If the plague be spread in the house, It is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean. 45 And he shall break down the house, The stones of it, And the timber thereof, And all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 48 And if the priest shall come in, And look upon it, And, Behold, The plague hath not spread in the house, After the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, Because the plague is healed. 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, And cedar wood, And scarlet, And hyssop: 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, And the hyssop, And the scarlet, And the living bird, And dip them in the blood of the slain bird, And in the running water, And sprinkle the house seven times: 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, And with the running water, And with the living bird, And with the cedar wood, And with the hyssop, And with the scarlet: 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, And make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, And scall, 55 And for the leprosy of a garment, And of a house, 56 And for a rising, And for a scab, And for a bright spot: 57 To teach when it is unclean, And when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. \" Yep. People\"s limbs falling off while they are waiting for a bird to do unto them magical prowess is such a stroke of utter hypnotic comedic failure that is god and the bible. Only a completely insane man or woman could have made that one up. Yes, Without a doubt god and the bible are clearly man made. * This is how the bible and god investigates a murder. Yes with great envy, This is how our court system should absolutely 100% work in this country! Why not? Thankfully we have intelligence, Dignity and integrity, Unlike god and the bible. Great going with all your smarts and brain activity god. Keep it going! This is a true joke unto itself and why god and the bible cannot possibly be taken seriously. . . . Deuteronomy 21: 1-9 \"If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, Lying in the field, And it be not known who hath slain him: 2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, And they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 3 And it shall be, That the city which is next unto the slain man, Even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, Which hath not been wrought with, And which hath not drawn in the yoke; 4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, Which is neither eared nor sown, And shall strike off the heifer\\'s neck there in the valley: 5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, And to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried: 6 And all the elders of that city, That are next unto the slain man, Shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley: 7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, Neither have our eyes seen it. 8 Be merciful, O LORD, Unto thy people Israel, Whom thou hast redeemed, And lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel\\'s charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. 9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, When thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. \" Indeed so this is how according to the laws of the bible that how to investigate a murder should that place? Well appoint me as a judge so I can insanely let everybody go! * Matthew 19:12 \"For there are some eunuchs, Which were so born from their mother\\'s womb: and there are some eunuchs, Which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, Which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\\'s sake. He that is able to receive it, Let him receive it. \" Um yeah um OK well that\"s physically impossible and could -never- happen. Duh. Regardless, Its a pretty sick verse. But what can one expect emanating from the sickest book ever written? * Judges 1:19 \"And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, Because they had chariots of iron. \" Wow. God must be that weak. Since this mighty god has no power against the weak chariots of iron, One has to wonder if he has the power to defeat a gamma ray burst should one come this way? Clearly a misprint in the bible or god is man made. * Here\\'s a thinking, Rationalizing, Reasoning, Common sense, Logical question(s) (there are too many to count) in which religion, God and the bible has none: Why was god such an idiot? Why would god have only sent one jesus? After all this christ figure was/ is the most fought after figure in the entire history of the human race! But its god loves conflict, War, Death, Hate, Evil, Bloodshed, Murder, Hate. . . And the \"human\" baggage emotions this god has freely admitted to. . . Evil, Anger, Vengeance, Rage, Fury, Jealousy etc. Clearly more than one jesus was needed, Required and was necessary to have carried out god\"s word to have provided peace, Love, Care and kindness. But let\"s be honest here, That\"s not what god wanted, Otherwise he would have sent more than one jesus. He would have sent hundreds, Thousands, Millions. They could have all spoken in the same tongue that god would have wanted them to have spoken in. OR HERE\"S THE KICKER, HE COULD HAVE DONE IT HIMSELF! But its clear that god didn\"t want any of this. God instead wants turmoil and hate, Not peace by any means. Its what keeps god in office and gives him a job. After all what happens if the world happens to live in peace? God would have nothing to do. No one to b**ch at. No one to rule. No one to murder. No one to make war with. For all of those who have answered \"Only one jesus was needed\", Well you\"ve just answered your own question with an answer. Your precious jesus, In which there is absolutely no proof for him having ever existed in the first place as well as god, Is why there is so much hatred in this world. * Summary: The bible is littered with rules and regulations that no god/ supreme deity would -ever- put into play and much less expect people to believe, Much less live by them. Yet the bible is supposed to be perfect in every way. So is god. Clearly both are not. Since this is true, God, The bible and christianity should not in any way be worshiped, Idolized, Bowed down to nor yielded to.']\n",
            "['Thanks to PRO for his/her response and for returning to the debate. I will be taking PRO\\'s arguments in the final round into consideration seeing that he has been subject to unfair circumstances. I will start off by addressing PRO\\'s rebuttals against my case and then proceed to argue against his substantives.Defences against PRO\\'s rebuttals D1) Rebuttal 1PRO concedes to the fact that this \"might be true\", then makes an attempt to rebuke this by saying that he personally finds this very difficult. This is by no means adequate justification that Person A is on the back foot from the very start of a debate. What is difficult for PRO might be easy for another debater due to disparities in knowledge of the topic, debating proficiency and other factors. PRO needs to bring to the table factual and concrete analysis of the nature and roles of Person A and B that is consistent for all debaters, which he has not done so, to prove that Person A does indeed have a more difficult job to fulfill.D2) Rebuttal 2PRO\\'s response to this point does not yield any strength for his stance. He relates the purpose of debate which to convince the opponent with the emphasis that DDO\\'s voting mechanism places on arguments. My point about Person A slacking off was to prove the proportionate nature of difficulty between the two sides of the house, not to disprove the inherent attributes of a debate. Besides, both Person A and B are judged based off of the same voting criteria, thus this does not clash with my case which argues for the conditional equilibrium between the two sides of the house.D3) Rebuttal 3APRO seeks to rebut this by citing his personal experience in flame wars, which manufactures two mistakes. Firstly, this is an anecdotal fallacy [1], in no way is PRO\\'s experience an accurate representation of the reality of flame wars on YouTube. Even if we disregard this, PRO has not proved how flame wars can be classified as a form of debate, as he/she personally admits, hence this argument is not relevant to the motion.D4) Rebuttal 3BPRO states that both sides of the house don\\'t have equal facilities, but leaves this point hanging and does not further this with any reasoning, thus this point is negligible. He/she has also stated that \"people rebut original points only\" and don\\'t take the initiative to conjure up points of their own. In reference to my previous argument, the specifications for winning a debate do not concern the originality of the arguments. Furthermore, doesn\\'t selectively rebutting points grant a free win for whoever is coming up with said \\'original arguments\\'? How does this correlate with PRO\\'s stance that it is actually harder for the person who has to come up with original arguments (assuming that originality even matters anyway)?D5) Rebuttal 4PRO responds to this by saying that Person A gets less opportunities to rebut and present arguments, and clarifies that this debate actually encompasses Internet debates and that my arguments are less effective under this premise. Under the framework of DDO debate, Person A and B both get the same amount of chances to rebut and present arguments, it is simply a matter of who gets the last say. This is also the case with other styles of debate such as World Schools Style and British Parliamentary. I personally would like to decline PRO\\'s modification of the term \\'debate\\' from formal and structured discussions like DDO to ones found on YouTube. Those are aptly named flame wars and not debates for a reason. As such, I do not wish to see my arguments invalidated just because PRO failed to fulfill his/her burden of clarifying what \\'debate\\' means in the acceptance round.D6) Rebuttal 5BThese points do not contradict each other if you have factored in another portion of my argument, which states that Person A has the advantage of sculpting the debate (i.e. the definitions, scope of debate, additional rules) which compensates for the fact Person A does not have the last say in a debate. Even if we discount this, PRO still has to prove that in ALL cases of a debate, the person who is the first to deliver an argument is NEVER the last one to speak in order to uphold this point, which is not true. In World Schools Style for example, the Proposition/Government (equivalent to PRO on DDO) starts off the debate with their first speaker, but is also the side that concludes the debate with their reply speaker [2].Rebuttals against PRO\\'s substantivesR1) Point 1This argument does not stand for two reasons:1. PRO\\'s argument is entirely based off of the functionings of DDO debate, but forgets that this motion does not only concern DDO debates but \\'debates\\' as a whole. Debates can occur in real life, and one is not given the option of cherrypicking which debates to participate in in real life debates. Once again, I am aware that PRO wishes to amend the purview of the term \\'debate\\' to mean online debates, but I do not approve of this amendment as aforementioned as defining terms should only be conducted in the first round.2. PRO acknowledges that there are cases where Person B cannot preselect which debates to take part in based on the content that Person A has posted in the first round by raising the example of Person A using the first round as an acceptance round. Bear in mind that the motion states that \"Debates are harder when you are the first one to come up with points\", which, unless per specific explication by PRO, means that PRO will have to justify that debates are ALWAYS more difficult for Person A. By providing the example of the acceptance round scenario, PRO has essentially disproved this him/herself.Even if both of these counterarguments do not stand, PRO\\'s argument is still insufficient in justifying his stance for the reason that Person A is given the opportunity to thoroughly evaluate his/her decision to instigate a debate in much the same way that Person B is given the opportunity to consider accepting a debate or not. More importantly, Person A is entitled to choosing what topic to debate on based on his/her strengths and weaknesses as well as preferences in the same way that Person B can choose which debates to engage in according to their proficiency of the matters discussed in the motion. Furthermore, both sides of the house are unaware of the ability of their opponents to-be as they most likely do not know their opponent in person given that the opponent\\'s profile information is true in the first place. Thus, all factors accounted for, it is not more difficult for Person A simply because Person B is able to decide which debates to participate in.ConclusionTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points and defended against all of PRO\\'s offenses against my case. I have argued that the conditions are the same as well as the burdens for both sides of the house and justified any inconsistencies between Person A and Person B, thus I have effectively proved that both sides are inherently equal to one another in terms of difficulty, and any further dissimilarities in difficulty can be traced back to the varying competencies between the two debaters.Thank you to PRO for such an interesting debate and all audience members and potential voters for your attention.

As such, I will not be posting new arguments in this round and will extend my previous arguments. Please may I remind PRO that no new arguments will be presented in the next round by either side of the house as it is the final round of the debate. On a different note, I forgot to post the link of the webpage I referenced the definition of 'hard' from. Here it is:http://dictionary.reference.com...Thank you.\", 'May the best debater win! In addition to the content posted in Round 1, PRO also wishes to deliver this argument that he forgot to post in Round 1:All your points are concentrated into one postIn real life, you have limited time on what you can say. However, here you have 10000 characters. I\\'d say that\\'s enough to squeeze in 10 points. .. Imagine saying 10 points in 3 minutes. That\\'d be impossible. DEFINITIONSHard: Difficult to do or accomplish; fatiguing; troublesome [1]. BURDEN OF PROOFPRO must prove that debates are harder for those who are the first to deliver their arguments. CON must prove either that debates are easier for those who are the first to deliver their arguments or that debates are equally difficult/easy for both sides of the house. Note: For the sake of efficiency, I will be referring to the person who delivers their arguments first as \\'Person A\\' and his opposition as \\'Person B\\'. REBUTTALSR1) \"The one accepting the challenge can just read it and pick out the points you thought and debate on them. .. \"There is no evidence that this makes the debate difficult for Person A. How easy it is for the opposition to pick out flaws in your argument is proportionate to how well you fabricate your arguments. So to speak, if you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don\\'t put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points. Furthermore, what PRO has not talked about is that picking on the opposition\\'s points and \"thinking hard for points to support your view\" is a shared burden for both sides of the house. Person B who \"can just read it and pick out the points\" is also obliged to come up with substantives to uphold his stance, and Person A in turn has the responsibility to rebut those points and establish new arguments, and this continues until the last round. As one can see, both sides of the house have the same onus and hence no side is harder than another in this respect. R2) \". .. people usually don\\'t use original points beyond the opening statement, at least in the Internet. \"Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis. Thus, we can only go as far as saying that this is an opinionated statement by PRO. Even if we assume this to be true, we don\\'t see how this creates a disparity between Person A and Person B. Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarise points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion. R3) *please refer to PRO\\'s additional argument at the top*I don\\'t really know what to make of this argument. PRO compares debating on DDO with debating in real life through talking about word limits and time constraints, but does not proceed to make the connection between such a comparison and the difficulty discrepancy between Person A and Person B. As far as DDO is concerned (assuming that this debate is oriented around online debates seeing that PRO talks about the Internet and \\'accepting challenges\\'), both sides of the house are subjected to the same time constraints and word limits, thus this argument is hollow in the scope of this debate. SUBSTANTIVESP1) Same burdens, same conditionsBoth sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within. In the most generic sense, each side of the house must successfully uphold their stance and rebut their opponent\\'s points/rebuttals against their points to win the debate. The specifications for victory are the same, and hence it is not intrinsically more difficult for one side of the house to take the debate. There are, however, some slight differences in terms of what Person A and Person B are required to do in order to meet these specifications. Person A, for instance, has to characterise the problem and justify that it is indeed an issue in the status quo. Some may argue that this gives Person A an advantage because they may shape the debate to be in their favour. To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the \\'last say\\', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round. This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A. CONCLUSIONTo conclude, I have rebutted all of PRO\\'s points thus far and have demonstrated to you that a debate is structured in such a way that it allots the same context for each side of the house to debate within, and assigns the same goals for both sides to accomplish. A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B. Thank you and I await PRO\\'s response.']\n",
            "[\"Words to Begin the Debate with First off, I apologize for forfeiting the round. I have had some issues with logging in that is now fortunately resolved[1]. I will have to point out that I am only at Grade 8, and have never encountered debates this formal. However, I will try my best to defend my point. Also, my points were targeted to the general internet, not specifically debate.org despite what I said. Sorry for the confusion. Rebuttals Rebuttal 1 “…no evidence that this makes the debate difficult for Person A.” While this might be true, I personally find it very difficult. This might be a personal thing though, and everyone has their opinions, especially over the internet, where lots of people, and naturally, lots of kinds of people are in. Rebuttal 2 “If you are Person A and you wish to slack off and make things easy for yourself and you don't put effort into constructing your case, then you are simultaneously making things equally easy for Person B in terms of fulfilling their role of rebutting your points.” Again, while this might be true, isn’t debates all about convincing people to support either side? More points makes your arguments more convincing, and more valid rebuttals are also more convincing. According to debate.org’s 7 Point System (Source: http://www.debate.org...) “Who made more convincing arguments?” Is Worth the most marks (3). Therefore, even debate.org agrees that making arguments is important. While this might do nothing to support my point, I’d like to point that out. Rebuttal 3a “Firstly, this is a bare assertion fallacy. No evidence has been provided in support of this claim, nor has the argument been extended in the form of any analysis.” I have participated in LOTS of flame wars on YouTube, and other sites. Almost None of them provide original points, or maybe just points that are overused, even insults. As a matter of fact, insults make up the most. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) There ARE differences between flame wars and proper debates, however, not everyone is as professional as you. Like me. Some debate like normal flame wars. Again, some. Not many, not all. Rebuttal 3b “Both sides of the house can access the Internet and have the equal facilities and conditions to reference or plagiarize points off of various sites, thus this argument bears no relevance to the motion.” While that is true, I don’t think that they have completely equal facilities. However, this doesn’t matter. I have also pointed out that most people rebut original points only and doesn’t come up with any on the internet. Plus, they never cite any. Rebuttal 4 “Both sides of the house are delegated the same burdens, and are granted the same conditions to fulfill said burden within.” Please Refer to Rebuttal 3b. Plus, Person A gets one less chance to rebut to prove their point, especially since internet debates go on for infinite lengths, like 200 comments. (Example: http://bit.ly... (While this might be a bad one, It’s just an example.)) Again, I apologize for the confusion, but my points were targeted to the general internet, which makes your points less effective. Rebuttal 5 “To counteract this, Person B is granted the privilege of having the 'last say', or in other words, gets the opportunity to definitively conclude the debate in the final round.” While this is very true in Debate.org, it’s not in the internet. Please do not let this point affect your rating towards Con though, It was my fault. Rebuttal 5b (1) “This ensures that whatever analysis or rebuttals they make in the final round will go unanswered and its legitimacy will be entirely in the hands of the voters and/or judges with no influence from Person A.” (2) “A debate, by nature, is therefore fair to both Person A and Person B.” I personally think Point (1) and Point (2) Conflict. I think that the fact that you can’t rebut someone is very unfair, which adds to the unfairness of Person A. Person A loses 2 chances to rebut their Opponent, while Person B loses none. While I do understand that this is a counterargument, I have made more convincing ones in Middle School, that shows that the Counterarguments actually is a benefit, or is worth losing for. This is a debate on debates so I’d like to point that out. Arguments Point 0: Read me first If CON wants to, he can ignore the arguments, and pretend that I haven’t made any new arguments. As I had some account issues, I forfeited against my will, therefore I think it’s unfair to not let me make additional arguments. If CON disagrees however, he can ignore all my points. Point 0b: All my points I made in my Rebuttals Point 1: Everyone can see your arguments, and if they don’t know how to rebut them, they’ll skip While this might be untrue for those who uses Round 1 as an acceptance round, I personally don’t do so. I think it’s a waste rounds which is already not enough, especially since there is no time limit, or a time limit short enough to bother. If one is not confident on what they see on what Person A says, they’ll skip, and think their points thoroughly before coming back and accepting the challenge. If they fail todo so, they’ll simply ignore. If Person B’s arguments is so good they didn’t know what to say, they can’t withdraw, and will have to forfeit their rounds, which makes Person A seem bad, which ADDS to the unfairness. While the same might apply to Person B too, it does less. Plus, Person A doesn’t have an opportunity to pass, while Person B does. Conclusion While I might have not rebutted all points made by Con, I have rebutted most of them. A debate has many unfair places, especially for Person A. Points are shown to everybody before they accept them, Person B gets the final say. I’d like to apologize again for my misleading points. This time, My point targets specifically debate.org. However, that might have a chance to get ignored. -- NOTES -- [1] I do not have proof, so you'll have to trust what I say.

Unfortunately ive only made minor progress.', '1) Too little time\"It can be done one country at a time, over a period of 100 or 200 years.\"Theres too many countries for that to be an option though.... Over half the countries in the world have to deal with extreme poverty, and if the US and wealthy nations were to focus one country at a time for 20 years like your original plan suggests, then it would only be able to help 5-10 countries. That still leaves a large chunk of the world without any form of aid while still financially criplling the wealthy nations2) The US and other countries don\\'t have enough money:\"If done over a long period of time the money needed shouldn\\'t overwhelm the nations doing the giving.\"Thats EXACTLY what will happen dingus... Youre proposing that wealthy nations dump hundreds of billions of dollars into poor countries every year for 100-200 years, its a fact that such a policy would financially cripple even the wealthiest of nations such as the US3) Dumping Billions into a country doesnt work\"We didn\\'t hire the Iraqis and Afghans to rebuild their infrastructure. Not as far as I know, anyway.\"Yeah we did, thats the only thing we\\'ve been doing in both of those countries for the last 8 years. http://www.defense.gov...http://www.nytimes.com...4) The US and wealthy nations cant just overtake poor countries and rebuild them\"So a nation doesn\\'t have a right to help another nation on its feet?\"Thats not what im saying idiot.... The argument was that the US and other nations cant actually control the money they are giving to the poor nation and that they have to simply trust it to the local government that runs the poor nation.... And that time and time again that has shown to be problematic since poor countries tend to have horrendously inefficient and corrupted governments that would completely screw up handling hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid a year.....5) Many Poor Countries Don\\'t Have a Lot of Farmland:\"With today\\'s technology, including fertilizers and stuff like that, I\\'m sure we could make that land arable.\"Dude you cant turn a desert into farmland, and even if you could Africa doesnt exactly have a bountiful supply of water to maintain such a farmhttp://thewaterproject.org...6) The Program Relies on Idiotic Assumptions:\" I think the program would work, if done properly.\"But it WONT be done properly because it never HAS been done properly..... Dumping trillions into a country to improve it has shown to not work at all, and youre ignoring that simply because you \\'think\\' that this time it will be different.', 'Reasons why this program wouldnt work in a million years:1) There are simply too many poor countries in the world to dump billions into. Pro\\'s program focuses entirely on Haiti at first, which has less than 0.15% of the global population, and then claims that if it will work in Haiti then it can work in the rest of the world.... The problem is though that the world consists of downtrodden countries that are WAAAAAAAAAY bigger and more populated than Haiti, and improving the wealth of those nations will dwarf the cost it takes to fix up a country as small as Haiti....... Countries like Zimbabwe, India, Somalia, Nigeria, Egypt, etc are all countries of much larger size and much bigger populations that any effort to eliminate extreme poverty in those nations would require trillions to fix over a couple of years.......2) The US and other wealthy nations arent that wealthyThe US isnt this vast source of wealth where it can dump trillions of dollars down the drain in trying to help every dirt poor country in the world become slightly less broke. The US already owes more money than any other nation in the world, and other nations in Europe arent much better off in terms of their debt either.... A proposal like this that calls for all the wealthiest nations to pour trillions into half of the nations in the world that struggle with extreme poverty would simply drive the wealthy nations that much further into debt, perhaps into outright bankruptcy, because those coutnries dont have that much money to burn on other nations. 3) It probably wouldnt even workIn the past ten years alone, the US has poured hundreds of billions, maybe even a couple trillion, dollars into Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan in an effort to build up those countries and also to fight the war on terror...... Despite these TRILLION dollar interventions over the course of over a decade now, Iraq and Afghanistan are still two of the most failed nations in the world, and Pakistan is still towards the bottom of the list as well: http://en.wikipedia.org...Dumping trillions of dollars into a country that only averages a couple billion in GDP each year simply doesnt lead to explosive or even modest improvement over the years like your program suggests it would..... In fact the only reason why Iraq and Afghanistan have jumped a few spots is because other nations have gotten even poorer, not because theyve necessarily improved. If pouring TRILLIONS into Iraq and Afghanistan for 10 years didnt fix the poverty in those countries, then what in the hell makes you think that pouring billions into other countries for 20 years would have a better effect?4) The US and wealthy nations cant just walk around wherever they want and nation build as they please Despite nations like Haiti and Iraq being poor as hell, they still have governments which have sovereignty in trying to fix their nations. Any donation by the US and wealthy countries to fix up a country therefore goes to the governments that are already there trying to fix the problem, and if I know governments of crappy countries like I think I know them, then chances are they are going to completely blow that money on something else. Nations gripped with poverty correlate very well with nations that have super corrupted governments (Nigeria and North Korea for example). If you are going to dump billions into a country, then what you actually are doing is giving it to the governments in those nations and hoping that they dont misuse it, or even use it inefficiently..... And 10 out of 10 times they WILL screw something up and the money wont go where it is supposed to go. 5) A lot of poor countries dont have arable land. Youre entire program focuses on first setting up infrastructure and building farms..... Well thats a problem for countries that are almost entirely desert and dont have many areas to even build farms in the first place.... Libya, Chad, Algeria, Niger, Somalia, and Mali are all countries where only small percentages of land can be farmed at all. Mali is only listed at 5% of percentage of land that can be farmed, and many other countries arent much better offhttp://www.tradingeconomics.com...Your program focuses heavily on farming to build up the country, but in countries that dont have any land that can be farmed, this program is completely useless and doomed to fail. 6) The program operates on a lot of idiotic assumptions\"the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time\"There literally is no evidence suggesting this will happen at all..... This is just wishful thinking. If the only reason a country is growing is because of stupendous foreign aid, then everyone there will believe that they can only improve their country if they have lots of foreign aid coming in, which is the exact opposite of what you claim they will do. In addition to that, corrupted government officials will also look at foreign aid as the only way they can keep get massive sums of money for their country, which could easily cause them to drag their feet or delay efforts to improve the country just so that they can prolong how much money foreign nations keep giving them. ==================================================================================In summary: The program wont work, similar programs havent worked in the past, wealthy nations arent that wealthy, there are way too many poor nations in thw rodl to dump billions or trillions of dollars into, a lot of poor nations dont have that much arable land, and this is a really dumb program to advocate for.......']\n",
            "['You appear to be halfway insulting me and halfway arguing your case. However, your points are all valid. Therefore, I concede victory to you.', \"1.

Farms will provide food for the nation, and the people will learn to support themselves without foreign aid. The people will believe in their own ability for the first time in a long time. After everyone has food to eat, other professions will be explored, such as office jobs. After twenty years or so the country will be much better off, and then the US can end its program and perhaps do the same thing in another country. I am well aware that this would probably not benefit the United States in any way, but it would be done in the name of eradication of poverty. If all the wealthier nations funded these programs, extreme poverty would be nearly extinct within 100 years. I await a response, from someone who's willing to debate this topic with me.\"]\n",
            "['(See explanation in comments before reading.) Your argument in all of its forms is a proof by contradiction. First, I will address the original. I will only present the relevant lines in order to make it more readable: A - It is possible that a maximally great being exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it existed in only some possible worlds, it would not be maximally great, as it would be even greater to exist in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. What definition of great must we use to allow us to assert that it would be \"greater\" to exist in all possible worlds? Throughout the debate, I have proposed two: 1 - \"Powerful; posessing the ability to accomplish.\" 2 - “Of major significance or importance.\" You presented a third: 3 - \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" As you can see, the definition we use is crucial in determining the conclusion of your argument, or whether it even flows. If we use the first definition, your maximally great being is not a god, which was the conclusion of your argument, as indicated at the end of the first round. You did not object to this; you merely stated that my definition was inadequate. It is also quite obvious that if we use the second or third definition, statement B is false, as existing in all possible worlds does not make a being greater under those terms. In rounds 2 and 3, you avoid this by stating that you have provided properties that a maximally great being would have. This is entirely meaningless unless we define how we measure greatness. For example, under definition 3, a maximally great being need not have these qualities; it can be admirable AND useless. In round 5, you indicate that great can simulateously mean all of its definitions. For example, it can mean a combination of the above 3. This simply cannot be, for those definitions can interfere. Again, I propose that under definition 2, I am the greatest being. Under definition 1, obviously an omnipotent being would be maximally great. If I were omnipotent, this would be even greater than either of the other two, and thus an omnipotent me would be the maximally great being. If we prove the existence of a maximally great being using those 2 joint definitions, we have just proved the existence of an omnipotent me! This is why we must stick to one definition of the word per argument and/or prioritize them. You attempt to face my request for a definition of \"great\" for the first time in rounds 3 and 4 by posting a different version of the argument in which you avoid using that word: A - It is possible that a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and necissarily-existing exists, so it exists in some possible world. B - If it exists in some possible worlds, it exists in ALL possible worlds. C - Therefore, it must exist in all possible worlds. I will restate this point: \"Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid.\" Here are your objections to the gods I presented, which you list in round 5: \"...Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience.\" If we define \"Horrible\" as, \"Causing fear or dread or terror,\" a being which is omnipotent would certainly cause more fear than a limited being. You suggest that it would not need to be able to create a universe, but how horrible could it be if it were not able to create things which it could terrify and maim? Omniscience would also enhance the horribleness of the being. Thus, both of these qualities are musts for a maximally horrible being. You do make the claim that maximal horribleness contradicts omnipotence, but you do not back this up. Anticipating spectators\\' feelings toward this claim, note that this is only true in the case that maximal horribleness implies that some things are not logically possible, such as saving a kitten from a tree. The fact that the maximally horrible being is unwilling to help a kitten from a tree does not mean that it, in principle could not help a kitten from a tree. Furthermore, I am of the opinion that a being which could help the kitten and instead chooses not to is more horrible than a being which simply could not. \"There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate).\" I can easily conceive of necessarily-existent beings possessing these qualities. There need not exist things which the maximally irritating being can annoy. There also need not exist a being with which the maximally competitive being can compete. It would be within the power of each of these beings under their omnipotence to create things to irritate with which to compete. Similarly, as per your definition of a maximally great being, such a being would be omnibenevolent. There need not exist a field in which this being can do good works; it can create a field within which it can do good works Unless you want to concede that your argument structure is invalid, you must accept the existence of these beings. Fortunately, no one need accept their existence as the argument structure is demonstrably invalid via the use of another god. I conceived of this god in a rather absurd dream last night: the maximally detectable being. The maximally detectable being would have to be omnipotent to ensure circumstances under which it would be detected. The maximally detectable being would have to be omniscient to ensure it has knowledge of all states of the universe with which it manipulates circumstances via its omnipotence to maximize its detectability. The maximally detectable being is necessarily existing. And finally, the maximally detectable being ensures that the minds it creates would be aware of the presence of the maximally detectable being with 100% certainty. Assume your argument structure is valid. It is possible that a maximally detectable being exists. If your argument structure is valid, the maximally detectable being can be proven to exist using that structure. Therefore, the maximally detectable being must exist. If the maximally detectable being exists, you and I would detect it with 100% certainty. Neither you nor I have detected this being, therefore it does not exist. This proves either that one of your premises is false or that your argument structure is invalid. Some minor points from round 5: [1]: I need not give an argument for a claim I did not make. If you read what I wrote, I said nothing of brains. If an entity does not have a mind, it is not logically possible for it to do things which require a mind. You have not shown it to be the case that mindlessness contradicts omnipotence, because all of the things you claim are logically possible without a brain, which I do not deny, DO require a MIND. Again... the non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. [2]: Note that my statement was in response to another claim you made in round 4: \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" The rock is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to do anything today.\" The rock is simply not choosing to do anything as it cannot choose. The non-conscious entity is not thinking \"I\\'m not going to exercise my limitless power.\" It is simply not exercising its limitless power because it does not have the ability to do so. If it had that ability, it would contradict its mindlessness, which you never successfully proved to be impossible. [3]: I did concede the existence of a \"maximally great being.\" However, the existence of an utterly useless thing was not your conclusion. Although I conceded the existence of something with the same name as what you arguing for the existence of, it is not the same thing; I have not conceded the debate.', 'Thank you for finally expressing your position on the use of the word \"great.\" I do find it saddening that you have waited until round 4 to do so, but I hope that my points will become clear now that you have done this. You suggest that the argument proves the definition to which you appealed. This is true if and only if your definition allows your argument to be valid. For example, if I define a maximally great being as a being with the highest tolerance for spicy food, it does not logically follow that its existence in a possible world implies its existence in all possible worlds. Until you define the word \"great,\" it is unclear if your argument follows logically. You then present, again, another form of the argument which does not use the word \"great.\" I should first note that this is not the same argument that you were arguing for the validity of. Reminding the voters to keep this in mind, I shall do the extra work of dismantling it anyway: I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds. This is a possible world under your definition. Under your \"new\" definition of a maximally great being, premise 3 has thus been falsified. Furthermore, in philosophy, validity is determined by truth tables. Any form of argument in which the conclusion may be false given true premises is invalid. I shall now define a few other gods: A maximally horrible being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, and omnimalevolent A maximally irritating being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent, regularly intervenes in the universe to play practical jokes on people and confuse them, and has an inexplicable love of Miley Cyrus music. A maximally competitive being is a being which is omnipotent, omniscient, necessarily-existent being and which has only one goal: to undo everything the maximally great being does. If the ontological argument were valid to prove the existence of any being you define, it is also valid to prove the existence of any being I define. Unless you concede the existence of those beings which I have defined, the argument structure is invalid. Fortunately, the existence of all of these things is negated by the falsity of premise 3 under their definitions. In response to extension 2, this is what I was countering when I first said that I conceded the existence of a maximally great being if and only if it allowed for the validity of the argument. Any maximally great being which would fit would not be considered God. If you propose to use the definition of a maximally great being that the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses, I then ask you to define \"excellence\" just as I asked you to define \"greatness,\" and for the same reason. I also bring forth the possible world which is inaccessible via other possible worlds and in which necessary existence is not a property. Thank you for providing a definition of the word \"great\" which allows your being to be omnibenevolent. Unfortunately, if this is what is meant by \"great,\" premise 3 of your argument is false. An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world. Your flaw resides in attempting to combine all definitions of the word \"great.\" This is the nature of the equivocation fallacy. A problem arises when we decide which definition will take priority. For example, if great means \"Powerful. Possessing the ability to accomplish,\" and \"of major significance or importance,\" one of two things is called into question: whether this maximally great being should be considered a god, or the validity of the argument. If the former takes priority, then the same problems I have presented before arise. If the latter takes priority, then I declare that I am greater than God. On the necessity of consciousness, note that I was careful in my wording. I suggested that a disembodied mind may not be logically possible. However, this appears to be distracting you from the main issue. My statement was that a maximally great being need not be conscious, depending on the definition of great. If this being does not have a mind, then it cannot think, reason, etc. However these are things which are logically impossible to do without a mind. There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact. Extension 3 is but a reiteration of this point. I have already addressed this. \"Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose.\" This does not follow. A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to. This does not entail an ability to choose. It is possible that the thing simply cannot choose due to a logical impossibility to do so. Remember that omnipotence is not necessarily useful. In response to your final statements, if the word \"great\" was not required in the beginning, then you should not have used it in your definition. This was a flaw in your own planning. Definitions are best kept specific and exclusive. Your original definition was neither. I will, for the last time, suggest that you present a definition of the word \"great\" so that your original argument can be valid and your maximally great being will retain the status of \"god.\" You may want to present another argument, but this is not relevant to the validity of your original argument, which you were arguing for. Furthermore, based on my past experience, your original argument is the one which will be the easiest to defend due to its vagueness. It is my recommendation that you focus your next round on it instead. I await your decision.', 'Thank you for attempting to clarify this for me. I have indeed understood the argument, and I have spent the past two rounds explaining to you how crucial it is that you define the term \"great.\" Unfortunately, you have still neglected to establish a definition. This is of prime importance in determining either the truth of your premises or the validity of your argument. Please choose a definition for great which can be used to describe God in the way that you desire and also allows your argument to retain its validity. Your other option is to be guilty of an equivocation fallacy. I requested in round 1 that you do this in round 2. I am now asking that you do this in round 4. You have indeed defined a maximally great being... however, you have done so quite poorly. To provide this definition, you have used a word which does not have a certain definition. If we don\\'t know what \"great\" means, how are we supposed to know if a maximally \"great\" being is comparable to God? Again, I provide the example in which \"great\" means “of major significance or importance.\" In this case, I am greater than God, as I am much more important to myself as I do not believe in God. Am I God? Of course not. I implore you; for the sake of the validity of your argument, provide a definition for the word \"great.\" It\\'s quite impossible for me to continue until you provide me with a sufficient definition. I have already shown your definition of a maximally great being to be faulty under my definition of \"great,\" and you have not contested it under this definition. Extend all arguments until pro provides a valid definition. As for your refutation of my claims about existence... I should warn you not to become too distracted with this. This was after all only a suggestion as to what this maximally great being could be; it is not necessary for me to provide this in order to show your claim for the existence of God to be false. All the same, as I have about 6000 characters left, I shall defend it. At no point did I suggest that existence is a property. I am well aware of the proof of which you speak; however, I suggested existence as an entity, not a property. Existence may not be a predicate, but it certainly can be a subject. Furthermore, in the case of existence itself, a consciousness may not be logically possible as there would be no physical thing to be responsible for this consciousness. Thus, its omnipotence remains intact. You accuse me of imporperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence.', '“Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true.” Unfortunately, your conclusion was not “There is a maximally great being,” but “There is a God,” which you indicate in the final line of the first round. There is indeed a maximally great being; you have no disagreement from me on that count. My disagreement is in that this maximally great being is God or even A god. This statement also encompasses the claim you make in your final paragraph of round 2. “Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\"” Unfortunately, without establishing a definition of the word “great,” you are potentially guilty of an equivocation fallacy. Allow me to explain: If we take the word “great” to mean “of major significance or importance,” then your maximally great being is not omnipotent, omniscience, or omnibenevolent. In fact, I declare that a maximally great being would instead be myself. I am much more important to me than an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being, because I do not believe such a being exists. Therefore, I can think of a “greater” being than the greatest conceivable being. It is clear you do not accept the definition of “great” to be “Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish.” I suggest you attempt to establish an alternative definition in the next round to avoid the aforementioned fallacy. You suggest that “[your] definition” is superior at the end of the paragraph I have just referenced. I ask: did you mean the definition of a maximally great being? If this is the case, then I will simply state that your definition can be less restrictive and accomplish the same goal, and is thus, inferior. Indeed, one component is potentially contradictory (provided that you do not sufficiently defend it), which, if shown to be the case, would entirely nullify the usefulness of your definition. Did you mean the definition of “great,” and “greatness”? If this is the case, then I again suggest you attempt to establish these definitions in the next round. I will extend my argument against omniscience as your rebuttal is based upon a disagreement on the meaning of the word “great.” Until you establish an alternative definition, the argument stands. “An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being.” A being need not be benevolent to establish a moral law, should one exist. In fact, an omnipotent, omnimalevolent being would have to establish a moral law in order to defy it. You claim that to be good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Indeed, we may prefer a being which is all-good, but if the definition of “greatness” is not established to have a meaning that encompasses morality, this claim holds no weight. Therefore, I again claim that a neutral being would be greater than either as it would have no restriction upon its actions. “Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things.” Indeed, existence is responsible for all logically possible things. If existence did not itself exist, then there would not exist anything, including the concepts of those things which are logically possible. By itself existing, existence has put into place all that exists, and an alteration in existence itself could put into existence anything which could possibly exist. “But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence.” Again, this disagreement takes place based on your disagreement with my definition of “great.” I will take this opportunity to put further weight on the irrelevance of omniscience until an alternative definition is given.', 'As a disclaimer, I agree that the ontological argument is a sound argument for a maximally great being. What I will be showing to be faulty is your definition of a maximally great being, and therefore your suggestion that this maximally great being is God. This will become clear in a moment. For the purpose of this argument, I put forth the following as suggestions for definitions of “great” and “greatness”: Great – Powerful; possessing the ability to accomplish. Greatness – A measure of a thing’s ability to accomplish. For this round, I will be operating under these definitions. If you do not agree with these or wish to put forth alternative definitions, please do so in the next round. It is your assertion that a maximally great being would be omniscient. I claim that omniscience is irrelevant to a being’s greatness. Indeed, it is my claim that consciousness is not a quality required of a maximally great being. A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be. Our human perception suggests that having a mind makes things “better,” but this does not make something more able to accomplish. If a maximally great being were instead a pre-planned set of events dependent upon circumstances, it would not change that being’s ability to set those events into motion. It is also your assertion that a maximally great being would be omnibenevolent. Even if we establish that such a being had a consciousness, it is not required that it do good works. Again, certainly we humans would prefer that it were benevolent. However, an omnibenevolent being is in fact limited in that it cannot perform evil tasks. I propose that a neutral being is in fact greater than either an omnibenevolent or omnimalevolent being as it can freely perform either good or evil tasks, if we were to even establish that such things existed. What we are left with is a being which is omnipotent (that is, it can accomplish anything), and exists in every logically possible world. Existence itself is omnipotent (If it exists in a possible world, then it has been accomplished under the power of existence itself. Not even God is claimed to be able to make logically incoherent things exist.) and must exist in every logically possible world, as for it to be otherwise is a contradiction. Existence itself is a maximally great being. If you wish to worship a non-conscious entity which would as soon destroy you as create you, you are free to do so. However, it is my contention that this is no God at all, but merely a feature of reality.']\n",
            "['This is a terrible parody. The reason why a MGB under the definition I presented applies to all possible worlds is because a property of a MGB as defined is that the explanation for its existence, if it actually exists, is necessary rather than contingent existence. If you define a MGB as one that is most \"tolerable\" of spicy food then the premises would not follow from this definition. So by using this example, which is fallacious, and comparing it to the definition I gave, which does lead into the conclusion, you have proven that the definition to which I have appealed is sound. Necessary existence is existence in every logically possible world. Necessity is a property, existence is not. Then, FINALLY, you attempt to deny a premise of the actual argument. The arguments without the word \"great\" in them are NOT different arguments. They are the same exact arguments I gave in the first post. What you have not refuted is that the word \"great\" is meaningless since the argument functions by replacing it with \"God\" and O^3NE the same exact way. Thus, definitions like the ones you gave do not matter when determining the soundess of the argument. \"I am currently thinking of a world in which necessary existence is not a property and which is inaccessible via other possible worlds\" This shows your ignorance of the modal realm. In no possible world can necessity not be a property. This is true because anything that exists has an explanation of its existence. These explanations are of two sorts: (1) they exist by a necessity of their own nature or (2) they exist by an external cause (contingency). The property of necessity exists in every possible world. These are the two explanations of being. I will address your parodies by addressing the first. My objections will apply to all of them: On Maximal Horribleness: This is bad. \"Maximally Horrible Being\" just is to say that there exists a being that is omnimalevolent (this is what it means to be maximally horrible). But, Maximal Horribleness does not, in itself, warrant the application of omnipotence and omniscience. Thus, it is impossible for this being to have these properties as well as necessity since \"Maximal Horribleness\" only entails one of the properties you described: omnimalevolence. On the contrary, a MGB as defined as a \"being than which none greater can be conceived (I stated this in round two)\" necessarily must have omnipotence etc. since if it did not, one could conceive of a greater being. But a \"maximally horrible being\" does not have the same application since I can conceive of a Maximally Horrible Being not being omnipotent; that is, I can conceive of a being that is about to inflict horror, but this does not mean that it must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible (omnipotence). In order to be a Maximally Horrible Being it does not need to be able to create the universe for example. So the argument fails because it actually contradicts omnipotence. Let me just say a word about irritating and competitive: these things are illogical. There cannot be a MG irritating or competitive being because such a being would necessarily have to rely on things to irritate and things to compete with (as you demonstrate). This, it is CONTINGENT on the existence of other things. Hence not necessary. Hence not applicable. So you have not given a successful parody. You then ask to defined Maximal Excellence in the Stanford definition. Ironically, they did that for you, once again. Maximal excellence is an entity which possesses: \"omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect.\" What makes it MG is that it is necessary. \"An omnibenevolent being would be just as benevolent if restricted to one possible world.\" But it could not be restricted to one possible world. It is a contradiction to say a necessary being (exists in all possible worlds) is \"restricted to one possible world.\" \"There is no way, at least that you have presented, to get from mindlessness + omnipotence to a contradiction, therefore implying mindedness. The non-conscious entity\\'s omnipotence remains intact.\" This is hopelessly fallacious. You claim that minds cannot exist without brains. You have made an assertion, you have not given an argument. So I will attempt to anticipate since this is my last chance: all arguments for substance materialism are that we know of no minds that do not depend on the brain. Notice how this is specific to our experience and to homo sapiens. There are no logical inferences that allow one to say that because humans don\\'t have embodied minds, that therefore they are impossible. You have to show that the concept is like a round square, and clearly it is not. Additionally, you are ONCE AGAIN, equivocating on omnipotence: Your claim is that an omnipotent being exists but it cannot be called God since it is not conscious. This is a contradiction. By definition omnipotence is a being\\'s ability to do all things that are logically possible. But we know that consciousness is logically possible. Which means your being is not omnipotent since it does not have consciousness. Which means omnipotence is reliant on consciousness. An unconscious all powerful things cannot have consciousness hence not making it all powerful. You lose here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" This is just ABSURD. You beg the question here. \"A rock need not do anything if it chooses not to.\" A rock cannot choose! Thus my argument still stands: an omnipotent being must be conscious since by definition it must be able to choose but choice is only possible with consciousness. REASONS TO VOTE FOR ME: 1.Definitions DO NOT matter in terms of taking one word out of MGB an defining it. Remember that I defined such a being as being omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent in every possible world AND as \"a being than which none greater can be conceived.\" My opponent has tried to refute it by saying \"great\" can mean different things. This does not matter since the argument proves the definition I gave as a collective thing: MGB. Moreover, the word \"great\" is not needed in the argument: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists This is the same exact argument as I originally offered. It proves the existence of the same exact being. The argument stands. 2.I proved that the use of individual definitions, which is what he is doing, is fallacious. He has yet to respond to this: \"A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics.\" 3.My opponent CONCEDED that a MGB exists. He just said it is not \"conscious,\" but that it is omnipotent. This is the reason you should vote for me: he concedes an omnipotent being exists, but an omnipotent being MUST BE CONCIOUSS because if it is not then that necessarily means it cannot do something that can logically be done: perceive, think, choose etc. So my opponent tacitly concedes the entire debate.', 'I am sorry. You are not answering the argument. The argument does not rely on the individual definition of its parts. The definition of a MGB as defined by Alvin Plantinga, who developed this argument, is as was defined by me in round one. You are quibbling about nothing Extension One: Everyone can extend the argument I made in the first rebuttal about how his definitions game was irrelevant. The argument does not rely on the definition of particular words. Rather, the argument proves the definition to which I appealed. I demonstrated this in the following way, an argument to which he did not respond: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists See, using \"MGB\" is not needed; its just three words used to defined a being with the properties mentioned above. The argument functions the same and proves that a being with O^3NE exists. The conclusion follows unless he attacks one of the premises, which he has yet to do. Extension Two: I also proved the above argument by showing that using specifically \"MGB\" is necessary if I simply replace it with \"GOD.\" God is defined as an omnipotent, all knowing all good and necessary being. Now, working under this definition, the argument still works into the conclusion, PROVING THAT INDIVIDUAL DEFINITIONS ARE IRRELEVANT: 1. It is possible that God (as defined) exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ....The rest follows. Moreover, the use of individual definitions, I argued, is misleading. There are dozens of definitions of the word \"great.\" None of the encompass the philosophy of religion since, a common dictionary is not a good reference when having discussions like these. First I will offer a collective definition of a MGB from an authority (since I seem to be inadequate) and then use individual definitions to do the exact same ridiculous things hes doing to undermine his positions: From Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: \"The \"victorious\" modal ontological argument of Plantinga (1974) goes roughly as follows: Say that an entity possesses \"maximal excellence\" if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Say, further, that an entity possesses \"maximal greatness\" if and only if it possesses maximal excellence in every possible world—that is, if and only if it is necessarily existent and necessarily maximally excellent.\" It matters not individual definitions, but the collective definition since no matter what you call it, the argument proves that an All knowing, all good, all powerful and necessary being exists. Call it a MGB or not. Call it a sandwich (this would be equivocating but if you define \"sandwich\" as having these properties, then the argument STILL works and it proves a God in whom you do not believe) But now I will employ reductio ad absurdum to show how your use of definitions is pointless. OMNIBENEVOLENCE: A definition of \"GREAT\" is \"having unusual merit, very admirable.\" \"Of noble character\" Well, one of the dozens of definitions of this word encompasses the above. So if individual definitions matter, I guess being all-good is a part of \"merit,\" \"admiration\" and \"nobility.\" So in order for you to dispute this, you would have to attack even more words. This shows the absurdity in your tactics. You make an unwarranted assertion and finally attack the idea of being all-knowing as \"may not be logically possible.\" That\\'s nice, can you provide an argument? There is no explicit logical incoherence of an unembodied mind; there is therefore a possible world in which these things could exist. They are metaphysically possible. I do not even need to defend dualism-interactionism because you make a devastating concession. Namely, you concede that a MGB exists, but it only has the property of omnipotence. Extension 3: This is devastating. You have not responded to the fact that you are equivocating. Omnipotence means, for the third time, the ability to do all things that are logically possible. If this being is omnipotent and does not have the property of consciousness, and by extension, the ability to think, feel, act in purpose etc., then there are logically possible things it cannot do. Hence, not omnipotent. But you conceded it was omnipotent. Therefore, it follows necessarily that it does have a mind not bound by physicality. You object: You accuse me of improperly using the word \"omnipotent.\" I should point out that existence need not do anything in order to be able to do everything. Taking advantage of omnipotence is not required under the terms of omnipotence. This is demonstrably fallacious: Sure, an omnipotent thing need not do anything if IT CHOOSES NOT TO. But that entails its ability to choose. Sure God does not need to do something, but in order for Him to be omnipotent, He must have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible. If something cannot think, reason, etc. the fact that it does not do this is irrelevant insofar as it cannot do these things, hence it not being omnipotent. Again, equivocation. For the sake of everybody else, I cannot stress how irrelevant his points are to the truth of the argument. You may disagree with the argument, but we can all agree, through the laws of logic and deduction, that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. And he has yet to respond to a single premise. Once again, his entire argument rests on the word \"great,\" having one of many definitions. I will repost: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists Notice here how \"great\" or MGB is nowhere in the argument. Why? Because it is NOT needed, \"great\" and \"MGB\" are not necessary for the argument.', 'I think you are not understanding the argument: I claimed that the definition, on which the Ontological argument relies, of a Maximally Great Being is a being who has the properties of omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, and existence in every possible world. Now, based on that definition of a MGB, the argument in terms of the syllogism proves that such a being exists. 1. It is possible that a MGB exists (MGB is the definition I gave) If this premise is true, then the rest follows. The argument proves the definition I gave, so in order for you to deny the existence of such a being, you have got to refute one of the premises. Insofar as you have yet to refute any of them, the conclusion follows with necessity. Your use of definitions is dubious and irrelevant. Even if I grant that your definitions of individual words is applicable, all I have to do is change the phrase \"MGB\" to God. Then the argument still follows so the semantics game is irrelevant: God is the greatest conceivable being. As the greatest conceivable being He would be omnipotent, omniscient and necessary in every possible world. 1. It is possible that God exists 2. If it is possible that God exists, then God exists in some possible world 3. If God exists in some possible world, then He exists in every possible world ... and the rest follows. So your quibbling about the semantics of the individual words of MGB is irrelevant since the conclusion still follows. The entire argument can be extended because the argument, regardless of your definitions, proves that a being that I HAVE DEFINED exists. So in order to win, you have got to reject a specific premise otherwise there is an indictment to which you may have to be subjected: irrationality. The conclusion follows with necessity if the premises are true, and you have yet to refute one of them. is sorry, you are incorrect. The conclusion of the syllogism, which is the argument, is \"Therefore, a MGB (as in, a being that is all powerful, all knowing, all good in every possible world) exists.\" Like I said, MGB in the syllogism is the same as saying \"It is possible that an all knowing, all good, all powerful, and necessary being exists in every possible world.\" MGB is simply to name a being who has all of those properties. I am not equivocating since I established a definition of an entire concept: maximal greatness. The argument functions under the definition I gave in argument one which you have yet to respond. You cannot simply define a word within a concept. The concept is defined as a whole. Remember, the argument functions independent of individual definitions, the argument (as in the syllogism) proves the MGB that I defined, so your quibbling is irrelevant. My argument is NOT based on a disagreement of the definitions you offered. I am sure that generically, that is what those words mean. But I have defined the concept of a maximally great being as a being than which no greater being can be conceived; the greatest conceivable being. The argument, which you have yet to respond, proves THIS definition, which means your arguments are irrelevant. I cannot stress this enough because the argument functions on the definition I provided. This is common knowledge if you look up the literature on the modal ontological argument. My argument from omniscience goes unrefuted. The fact is you CONCEDED omnipotence as a property of a MGB. You contradict yourself completely by saying that a MGB does not have the properties of knowledge, reason, all-knowingness etc. because that means there are things which a MGB cannot do/experience which contradicts omnipotence. Implication: you are equivocating in terms of omnipotence since this means to have the ability to do all of that which is logically possible, which includes being all-knowing. On omnibenvolence: look, even if such a being does not have to be benevolent, this is absolutely irrelevant. The reason is because the argument proves that a being with this property actually exists. Even if it does not have to have this property, so what? The argument proves that it does with the conclusion. \"Therefore, a MGB (as I have defined it) exists.\" On existence: it is paradoxical that you should make this argument. The obsolete version of the Ontological Argument developed by Anselm of Cantebury in 1033 A.D. made the same mistake by considering existence to be a property. Immanuel Kant did away with this argument by proving that existence is not a predicate or a property. This is absurd. Look it up, this has been sufficiently refuted. Moreover, your claim that existence alone is omnipotent is false and is equivocation. Omnipotent, again, means the ability to do that which is logically possible. But an abstract concept that you offer does not have the ability to think, experience personhood, etc. So you are not using the word properly. I think it is clear that the argument stands. To get away from the definition debate, here is why I win: 1. It is possible that an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent and necessarily-existent (O^3NE) being exists. 2. If its possible that an O^3NE being exists, then an O^3NE exists in some possible world 3. If an O^3NE exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world 4. If an O^3NE exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world 5. If an O^3NE exists in the actual world, then it exists 6. Therefore, an O^3NE exists in the actual world 7. Therefore, an O^3NE exists You have already conceded that the logic with which the argument functions is sound. So the conclusion follows from the premises and I have successfully circumvented your use of individual definitions to prove that a being, as I have defined it, actually exists. Hence, the Ontological Argument is sound As Bertrand Russell remarked \"Great God in boots! The Ontological Argument is sound!\"', 'Thank you for the debate. Right from the start I can make the clear extension of the Ontological Argument I offered. The reason is that even if everything you said is correct, the argument is still true, which means its conclusion is also true. Notice how the definition I offered of a MGB is not part of the argument in terms of the deductive syllogism. This is because the syllogism, if the premises are true, prove the definition of a MGB to which I appealed. That is, if the argument is true then the definition of a MGB I offered is exemplified in a being that actually exists. If you accept that \"it is possible that a MGB exists\" as in MGB that I defined, then everything follows. So you have not shown how my definition is incoherent. But, naturally, your arguments are vacuous. Your use of definitions for specific words are fallacious. My a MGB, supporters of the Ontological Argument do not mean Great to be \"powerful\" and greatness to be \"measure of ability to accomplish.\" As I said, taken together, a MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be conceived.\" If you can think of a greater being, then that would be the MGB. Thus, if the properties of this being to which I have appealed are properties that a MGB should have as a being than which none greater can be conceived, then it follows that my definition is superior. Omniscience: Your argument is demonstrably fallacious. You say: \"A maximally great being which can accomplish the same tasks without a consciousness would be just as great as a maximally great being with a consciousness would be.\" This is false. You already concede that a MGB would have omnipotence. But if a MGB has omnipotence, then it would have to have consciousness. For if it could not experience the ability to perceive and reason and think, then it not only is not a MGB but it is also not omnipotent because there is something that is logically possible that it cannot do; namely, the property of having consciousness. Moreover, if it does not have the ability to be all-knowing then it is not truly a MGB since we can plausibly conceive of a being that is greater; one who does have the property of maximal intelligence and knowledge. So your claim that a MGB is fallacious because by definition, the most perfect conceivable being would have the properties of knowing and reason and consciousness. These things are better to have than not to have, otherwise it is blind about without purpose. An omnibenevolent being is also a property of maximal greatness because to not be the greatest possible authority on morality would be inferior to what it means to be maximally great, that is, the greatest conceivable being. By the very nature of maximal greatness, the nature of such a being would entail the property of being all-good, for to be all good is greater than to be partially good or all-evil. Then you claim that existence itself is omnipotent. You have committed the fallacy of equivocation in terms of the word omnipotent. Omnipotent means a things ability to do all logically possible things. But an abstract concept of a thing that is, on your equivocated definition of omnipotence, void of any ability to perceive or reason or invoke purpose or experience love or experience person hood etc. is by definition not omnipotence. Your view renders this abstraction as a thing that cannot do a multiplicity of things that we would consider a MGB to be able to do. Thus, you completely undermine the definition of omnipotence because your view means there are plausibly things that cannot be done by this being. It is important to note, however, that I win even if everything above is false. You have simply pointed out that a MGB does not have to have certain properties. But you did not show that having those properties is logically incoherent. Since you did not prove that it is logically incoherent, then that means the argument\\'s conclusion follows and therefore a MGB under my definition exists. Since the argument is based on the definition I gave, and the definition I gave is logically possible, then the conclusion is inescapable based on the laws of deduction. Since it is possible that a MGB as defined by me in post 1 is possibly exemplified in a world, then it follows that such a being does exist, even if you are correct and a MGB does not have to have those properties. My argument shows that it does. By the way, references include Alvin Plantinga who developed this modal form.', 'Framework: In order to show that the Ontological Argument is not sound, the CON must show that one of the premises of the argument is untrue. If all of the premises of the argument are true, the conclusion follows with necessity as it is a deductive argument. Observation One: \\'Possible Worlds\\' are descriptions of reality. They are ways the world could have been but is not actually. For example, fairies do not actually exist, but there is some possible world in which fairies do exist. If something is possible, then it exists in some possible world. Observation Two: A Maximally Great Being (MGB) is a being that is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent and that exists in every logically possible world (necessary existence). Since an MGB is a being \"than which no greater being can be concieved,\" it must have the property of necessity since to exist in only some possible worlds would not be maximally great, that is, one can conceive of a greater being; namely one that exists in every world. Observation Three: To say something is possible, that is, something that is logically coherent, is the same as saying that there is some possible world in which this thing does exist. To say that a thing exists in every possible world is to say that that thing exists in the actual world, since out world is a possible world. To say that something, of which the property of necessity is exemplified, exists in some possible world, is the same as saying that it exists in every possible world because to necessarily exist means to exist in every possible world. The Argument: Premise (1): It is possible that a MGB exists Premise (2): If it is possible that a MGB exists, then a MGB exists in some possible world Premise (3): If a MGB exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world Premise (4): If a MGB exists in every possible world, it exists in the actual world Premise (5): If a MGB exists in the actual world, then a MGB exists Conclusion (6): Therefore, a MGB exists in the actual world Conclusion (7): Therefore, a MGB exists Premises 2-7 are uncontroversial. The modal logic with which the argument functions is very well established and both atheistic and theistic philosophers would agree. Thus, the whole argument rests on whether or not the existence of a MGB is possible. Justification for Premise 1: There are two types of possibilities: Metaphysical Possibility and Epistemic Possibility. The former represents things that are actually possible because their properties are not logically incoherent, or there are no logical contradictions. For example, a round square is metaphysically impossible because it is logically incoherent. Having a coin in your pocket is metaphysically possible since there is no logical incoherence about that event. Epistemic possibility is \"for all we know, X is true.\" It is the same as being presented with a difficult math equation and seeing the solution. For all you know it may be true or false. An example would be the coin: For all I know you could have a coin in your pocket. Metaphysical possibility deals with actual possibility, those things which could actually exist because their properties are not logically incoherent. Therefore, if something is logically coherent, then it is metaphysically possible. So, is the concept of a MGB coherent? Well, there seems to be no contradiction within the definition I gave; no incoherence. It seems perfectly plausible that the properties within the definition are logically consistent. Thus, if the definition on which the argument relies is coherent, then it follows that Premise 1 is true and therefore the argument is true. In order for the CON to disprove 1, the concept of a MGB needs to be proven incoherent; like a round square. No such contradiction seems to be evident. Thus, if you think God\\'s existence is even possible, then it follows that God exists. And we therefore have a priori proof for the existence of a MGB, AKA God.']\n",

You also haven't taken into consideration all the people who cannot be on the website everyday, and will miss out on voting, and each debate needs as many votes as possible, to keep any biases from affecting it, it is just like when the media takes a poll, if they don't poll a wide variety of people, they often end up wrong, for example, the Chicago Tribune stating that Dewey beat Truman in the presidential election... if we only allow a small amount of voters, we may end up with biased votes, especially in very controversial topic such as religion. Also, since the site is still growing, by limiting the time for which a debate can be voted on, we disallow future members from voting on certain topics, and as I have stated, you need a wide variety, and large amount of voters to be accurate. I believe that it is more important for the debate voting to be accurate, than for the debaters to be able to check the win or loss easily, and that there are better options for checking the win loss, if it is in fact really necessary.\"]\n",

I know some of you guys are thinking \"Like in books and movies?!\" My answer to that is no. You know what cloning is.

Cloning is important because if you\"re in a accident and you lose one of your limbs or organs or a body part, with therapeutic cloning you may be able to get it back. If you\"re a victim of heart attack, cloning can help by cloning healthy heart cells and putting it in damaged areas of the heart. Infertile couples can now have kids with cloning.

I will happily list some of them.\" Cloning might produce a greater understanding of the cause of miscarriages, which might lead to a treatment to prevent spontaneous abortions. This would help women who can\\'t bring a fetus to term. It might lead to an understanding of the way a morula (mass of cells developed from a blastula) attaches itself to the uterine wall. This might generate new and successful contraceptives.\" I got that quote from \"The Cloning Debate: Pro Views.\" ThinkQuest. Oracle Foundation, n.d.

Here is another quote. \"Easy replacement of internal organs and tissues for patients in need of transplants instead of waiting for suitable organ donors, alive or dead. Since the transplanted organ contains most of the recipient\"s genes, there is a lesser chance for rejection as well. Cloning can be a solution to the infertility issue among couples. Theoretically speaking, parents can choose the desirable qualities in their genes to be passed on to their children. Genetic research can immensely benefit from cloning especially in combating the wide range of genetic diseases.\" This information was from \"Surfcrs. \"Organ Cloning.\" Organ Cloning RSS.

This is because you are using an older cell to clone. Another risk is that it may reduce the overall value of human life.

At the same time, the church together with the other religious organizations argue against therapeutic cloning as well because, as mentioned above, they are guided by the idea that life starts at the conception and once the embryo exists it must be treated as a person, and thus destroying embryos and using them only for the purpose of research is not consistent with the religious view on the issue.\" That was a quote from \"Cloning- Ethical Issues.\" Ethical Issues Of Cloning.

            "['There aren\"t many cons to cloning? How about premature death, high rate of miscarriage, moral issues, very low success rate, and loss of individuality? It seems to me that there are quite a few. I can\"t see how you think cloning is a solution for infertile couples. The only couples that would be able to afford it would be the rich and famous. Even if a couple did find enough money, the success rate is simply not high enough to guarantee they leave with a child. \"For a recent paper on cloning in Science, Peter Mombaerts Peter Mombaerts , a scientist at Rockefeller University in New York City who clones mice, ran through 4,000 mouse oocytes\"he estimates that might be $2,000 worth of mice. Doing the same work in humans, he estimates, could cost $2 million. Scientists will almost certainly use fewer eggs if therapeutic cloning is used on people. But even if it required a mere 100 eggs, taken from ten donors, the cost of simply paying the donors could easily reach $50,000. On top of that, there would be medical costs involved in procuring the egg. Mombaerts believes it could cost more than $1,000 per egg when all is said and done. That means costs to treat one patient could conceivably soar above $100,000.\" This is according to \"Cloning\\'s High Cost.\" Forbes. Forbes Magazine. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. How many average American citizens do you think actually have the money to pay for something like that? The median income was $51,017 a year, says Hargreaves, Steve. \"Poverty Rate 15%, Median Income $51,017.\" CNNMoney. Cable News Network, 17 Sept. 2013. Web. 09 Mar. 2014. That is barely over half the cost of therapeutic cloning. The way I see it, cloning is highly impractical. Seeing as the cost is high, and the success rate low, very few can afford it. Along with reducing the value of life, cloning shortens the lifespan of the cloned organism. On top of all that, by continuing with cloning we are one step closer to a dystopian-like society where non-clones are frowned upon, and individuality is a crime. I believe cloning will do more harm than good, and this is why I have, and always will, support the con side.', \"In my opinion, the cons of cloning outweigh the pros. So many things can go wrong, and so many eggs are needed to produce a clone, that you have to ask yourself: Is it really worth it? Personally, I would not want therapeutic cloning. I wouldn't want a woman to have to give up her eggs for my needs. Donating eggs for cloning of any type, therapeutic or not, could turn into a negative thing. Women, similar to being used for prostitution, could be forced to sell their eggs for money. There could be a black market for human egg cells. Would you really feel comfortable using a unwillingly given egg? If cloning was done with, this would never have a need to happen. Along with selling human egg cells, the percentage of miscarriages is undeniably high. 90% of all animal cloning pregnancies result in miscarriage. Most of these miscarriages happen later on in the pregnancy, according to The British Fertility Society. To me, never having a baby at all is better than conceiving one, and losing it. Besides, there are hundreds of thousands of children available for adoption in the U.S. alone.\", 'If you think cloning should be legal, then why are you contradicting yourself? You are saying that most think it is immoral, and that it goes against religious beliefs. This doesn\"t sound like a \"pro\" side argument to me. Since I am strongly believe that cloning is wrong, a huge issue that I have with it is that it could minimize the value of human life, and we wouldn\\'t be individuals. Human life could be looked upon as something you can perfectly create, and that if your child doesn\"t satisfy your needs, you can go out and get another one made, tailored to your specific wants. Also, a caste-like system could re-emerge, putting perfect clones on the top. They would be the \"genetically perfected\". Smart, and attractive. They would also most likely be rich, since cloning is highly expensive and time consuming. How does that sound to you? A race of beautiful, genius people that are treated better than the average. I can tell you one thing, you wouldn\"t like it at all. Naturally made humans may be treated differently than the clones. They are average. You wouldn\"t be considered smart, or pretty unless you were a clone. This is one of the possible negative consequences of cloning. Ethics are highly controversial in the case of cloning. Many thing is is wrong for scientists to \"play God\". Most traditional Christians refer to an embryo as a human being that has a soul. They think it is immoral for scientists to clone to create or destroy embryos, even in the case of research. Around 78.4 percent of America is Christian, according to \"Summary of Key Findings.\" Statistics on Religion in America Report. Web. 03 Mar. 2014. If cloning was legal, nearly 78.4 percent of the U.S.A. would disagree with it. They think that when using an unfertilized egg for any type of cloning you are killing a possible human, a possible child. This doesn\"t seem at all moral, to me.', 'Wouldn\"t you feel bad about wasting the possibility of life with an unsuccessful cloning experiment? With the use of embryonic cells, we\\'ve been successfully cloning mammals since the mid-1980\\'s, but the possibility of actually creating a clone goes from 0.1% to 3%. This means that for every 1000 attempts, 1 to 30 clones are produced. That is up to 70 eggs wasted. With reproductive cloning, those eggs could have possibly been babies. Do you feel comfortable allowing scientists to take away the possibility of life from an egg? I should hope not. In addition, cloning could take away a sense of individuality, since a clone is the genetically identical twin to the person who provided the genetic material, no matter the age of either person. In my opinion, cloning should not be allowed because it strips a human of individuality, and has a very low success rate.']\n",
            "[\"I completely agree, IN A COURT OF LAW, the jury is suppossed to be an unbiased judge of a case. This is why random people are selected to for the jury. But in survivor you have played the whole game with the people that are then voting on your fate. FOr them to be impartial is impossible, and wy would you want them to be. Getting to the end and having the jury want to vote for you is one of the most challenging things in the game of survivor, making it tougher than almost any other reality TV show. So, if the jury deemed that they didn't want Russel to win, then he shouldnt have won.\", \"I am not going to deny the Russell Hantz played a good game of Survivor, in fact, it most probably the most manipulative game that the series has ever seen. I also won't argue the point the Russell Hantz 'outwitted and outlasted' his opponents, as this is clearly evident by the fact that he made it to the final three against a huge numbers disadvantage. However the main reason why Russell shouldn't have won Survivor is that he didn't. While this statement may, at first glance, appear to be tautological allow me to explain: There are ultimately two components involved in winning the game of Survivor. The first is to make it to the final three (or two), where the jury votes for the winner, and the second is to be able to win Jury votes once you are there. This aspect of Survivor is what makes it such an intriguing show. The winner is not necessarily the person who has played the best game from an outlasting point of view, but the person who the jury deems is the most deserving recipient of the title of Sole Survivor. The way in which Russell lied, backstabbed sabotaged and manipulated his way into the final 3 fulfilled the first requirement, but made the members of the jury so resentful towards him, that there was no way they would ever vote for him. Ultimately it comes down to the judgement and very often emotions, of these 9 people, and if they do not vote for you, it clearly illustrates that, out of the 3 members remaining, you are not who they believe should win and making the jury believe you should win is what Survivor, in essence, boils down to.Sure he may have found the hidden immunity idols .They weren't really that well hidden, and anyone with the time could have found them. Plus you must not forget that this is a TV show that can be influenced by the producers to enhance ratings. His sabotage of his own tribes campsite at the start of the game illustrates just how conniving he really was, and he certainly won't be the last to lose at the end in this way.\", 'Bring It OnI would like to point out that since Pro is arguing against the status quo, burden of proof is on them.']\n",
            "[\"1. Initially, your argument that Russell lost because of the jury's decision makes some sense. However, we need to consider what a jury is. A jury is supposed to be an unbiased group of people making a decision about another person's fate. The jury should have objectively made a decision as to who played the best game of Survivor. Instead, the jury allowed their personal vendettas against Russell, as he caused many of them to leave the show to come into play. The jury was, thus, bitter, and not awarding based on gameplay. If it did look only at who played the best game, it would have chosen Russell over Natalie (and Mick Trimming, who came in third place). Russell led the alliance back from the 8-4 deficit. Natalie and Mick did not have to do any of the strategizing, instead riding Russell's coattails to the end. They did none of the necessary work, but reaped all of the benefits of Russell's strategy. How is that fair? Also, Russell won more challenges (5) than either Natalie or Mick, both of whom won 3. To sum it up, the point of a jury is to be objective and unbiased, which it was not by voting for Natalie to win.2. Yes, it is possible that the producers made the hidden immunity idols intentionally easy to find. However, that does not mean that Russell had any advantage over the rest of the field in finding them. Everyone else had an equal opportunity to find the hidden immunity idols, but only Russell was able to. When combined with the other ways in which he controlled the game (challenges, leading the alliance, etc.), Russell should have won Survivor: Samoa.3. His early-game sabotage is irrelevant. The fact that he burned socks and emptied water bottles has little to do with the game he played and should not be taken into account by an unbiased jury. Also, other factors, such as the fact that he was already a millionaire are also irrelevant.Russell Hantz should have won Survivor: Samoa.\", 'I also want to point out that, as Russell Hantz made the Final Tribal Council, this debate solely is about the jury\\'s decision. Yes, the Galu tribe would have been wise to vote Russell out at the merge, when it had a 8-4 numbers advantage. However, Russell was able to turn the tribe against each other, find hidden immunity idols without clues, and convince Shannon \"Shambo\" Walters to work with his tribe. Also, it is important to note that Survivor is a reality competition show. It is a game that features castaways trying to \"outwit, outplay, [and] outlast\" each other (the show\\'s slogan). That encourages players to fight at all costs to survive and eliminate their competition. As Russell was on a tribe that lost almost every challenge before the merge, his tribe was at a significant disadvantage going into the merge. However, Russell was a brilliant game player and had a strategy to overcome a numbers disadvantage. On Day 1, he made alliances with several members of his tribe, including eventual winner Natalie White. From there, he would vote off anyone who threatened his game. By the merge, all that remained of his tribe was a close-knit group called the \"Foa Foa Four\". He then led Survivor\\'s biggest post-merge comeback ever. Even after Galu voted off Erik Cardona, a member many people did not trust, Foa Foa had a 7-4 disadvantage. So, he convinced Shambo to join his alliance and found a hidden immunity idol WITHOUT A CLUE. He then played it at tribal council, negating the 7 votes cast against him (Shambo was trying to feign loyalty to Galu) and sending Kelly Sharbaugh home. Suddenly, a 8-4 disadvantage had turned to a 5-5 split. Russell then convinced John Fincher, fearing the Purple Rock tiebreaker that could eliminate anyone, to vote with Foa Foa and blindside Laura Morett. Now, Foa Foa had a numbers advantage it would take to the end.']\n",

Yes, in hindsight, it was an unfair advantage, but virtually everyone was doing it. To leave out Bonds, A-Rod, Clemens, and Pettite would be leaving out four of the best players of all time (just to name a few). And most doctors have agreed with the point that PED's have a rather low plateau in terms of improving overall game, and that they act more as a longevity helper. Skill is there, PED help keep it going longer. You can't leave out an entire era of baseball, just because the players did what was inherent of the time; take PED's.\", \"The Hall of Fame is merely glorifying the biggest money makers/employees of the league.

You call it cheating, but there wasn't rules of regulations put in place at the time. It was stupid not to use steroids during this time. Most players will admit that steroids didn't effect the quality of their game, but rather just helped to extend their career. This may create artificially inflated records, but it's not like Clemens, Pettite, Bonds, A-Rod, Conseco, and Martinez wouldn't have been great players without them.

Steroids were just as part of the game during the 80's and 90's as Peanuts and Cracker Jacks. It was an era of steroids. If you weren't using them, then you were considered abnormal. You cannot fault an entire generation of players for just being a product of the times. I agree that records, such as the HR record broken by Bonds, should have an asterisk with them, but this should not be the case with the Hall of Fame.

            "['lol well I addressed 1 yes but I think these points can also be applied to 2 and 3., let\\'s see. For 2, Religious minorities have not \"flourished\" under Islam. In fact, they have dwindled to mere shadows after centuries of persecution and discrimination. Some were converted from their native religion by brute force, others under the agonizing strain of dhimmitude. What Muslims call \"tolerance,\" others correctly identify as institutionalized discrimination. The consignment of Jews and Christians to dhimmis under Islamic rule means that they are not allowed the same religious rights and freedoms as Muslims. They cannot share their faith, for example, or build houses of worship without permission. Historically, dhimmis have often had to wear distinguishing clothing or cut their hair in a particular manner that indicates their position of inferiority and humiliation. They do not share the same legal rights as Muslims, and must even pay a poll tax (the jizya). They are to be killed or have their children taken from them if they cannot satisfy the tax collector\"s requirements. For hundreds of years, the Christian population in occupied Europe had their sons taken away and forcibly converted into Muslim warriors (known as Jannisaries) by the Ottoman Turks. It is under this burden of discrimination and third-class status that so many religious minorities converted to Islam over the centuries. Those who didn\"t often faced economic and social hardships that persist to this day and are appalling by Western standards of true religious tolerance and pluralism. For those who are not \"the People of the Book,\" such as Hindus and atheists, there is very little tolerance to be found once Islam establishes political superiority. The Quran tells Muslims to \"fight in the way of Allah\" until \"religion is only for Allah.\" The conquered populations face death if they do not establish regular prayer and charity in the Islamic tradition (ie. the pillars of Islam). Tamerlane and other Muslim warriors slaughtered tens of millions of Hindus and Buddhists, and displaced or forcibly converted millions more over the last thousand years. Islamists in Somalia behead Christians. In Iran, they are jailed. One of the great ironies of Islam is that non-Muslims are to be treated according to the very standards by which Muslims themselves would claim the right to violent self-defense were the shoe on the other foot. Islam is its own justification. Most Muslims therefore feel no need to explain the ingrained arrogance and double standard. There are about 500 verses in the Quran that speak of Allah\"s hatred for non-Muslims and the punishment that he has prepared for their unbelief. There is also a tiny handful that say otherwise, but these are mostly earlier verses that many scholars consider to be abrogated by the later, more violent ones. As for Sura 109, any true Quran scholar will point out that the purpose of the verse was to distinguish Islam from the gods of the Quraysh (one of which was named \"Allah\") rather than to advocate religious tolerance for non-Muslims. At the time that he narrated this very early verse, Muhammad did not have any power, and thus no choice but to be \"tolerant\" of others. By contrast, there was no true tolerance shown when he returned to Mecca with power many years later and demanded the eviction or death of anyone who would not convert to Islam. In fact, he physically destroyed the cherished idols of the people to whom he had previously addressed in Sura 109. If tolerance simply means discouraging the mass slaughter of those of a different faith, then today\\'s Islam generally meets this standard more often than not. But, if tolerance means allowing people of other faiths the same religious liberties that Muslims enjoy, then Islam is fundamentally the most intolerant religion under the sun. For 3, There is not the least bit of intolerance for slavery anywhere in the Quran. In fact, the \"holy\" book of Islam explicitly gives slave-owners the freedom to sexually exploit their slaves \" not just in one place, but in at least four separate Suras. Islamic law is littered with rules concerning the treatment of slaves, some of which are relatively humane, but none that prohibit the actual practice by any stretch. Vote for me!!!', 'There shouldn\\'t be any argument over who the \"true Muslim\" is because the Quran clearly distinguishes the true Muslim from the pretender in Sura 9 and elsewhere. According to this - one of the last chapters of the Quran - the true believer \"strives and fights with their wealth and persons\" while the hypocrites are those who \"sit at home,\" refusing to join the jihad against unbelievers in foreign lands. In truth, Muhammad organized 65 military campaigns in the last ten years of his life and personally led 27 of them. The more power that he attained, the smaller the excuse needed to go to battle, until finally he began attacking tribes merely because they were not yet part of his growing empire. After Muhammad\"s death, his successor immediately went to war with former allied tribes which wanted to go their own way. Abu Bakr called them \\'apostates\\' and slaughtered anyone who did not want to remain Muslim. Eventually, he was successful in holding the empire together through blood and violence. The prophet of Islam\\'s most faithful followers and even his own family soon turned on each other as well. There were four caliphs (leaders) in the first twenty-five years, each of which was a trusted companion of his. Three of these four were murdered. The third caliph was murdered by those allied with the son of the first caliph. The fourth caliph was murdered in the midst of a conflict with the fifth caliph, who began a 100-year dynasty of excess and debauchery that was brought to an end in a gruesome, widespread bloodbath by descendents of Muhammad\"s uncle (who was not even a Muslim). Muhammad\"s own daughter, Fatima, and his son-in-law, Ali, who both survived the pagan hardship during the Meccan years safe and sound, did not survive Islam after the death of Muhammad. Fatima died of stress from persecution within three months, and Ali was later assassinated by Muslim rivals. Their son (Muhammad\"s grandson) was killed in battle with the faction that became today\"s Sunnis. His people became Shias. The relatives and personal friends of Muhammad were mixed into both warring groups, which then fractured further into hostile sub-divisions as Islam expanded. Muslim apologists, who like to say that is impossible for today\\'s terrorists to be Muslim when they kill fellow Muslims, would have a very tough time explaining the war between Fatima\\'s followers and Aisha to a knowledgeable audience. Muhammad explicitly held up both his favorite daughter and his favorite wife as model Muslim women, yet they were invoked respectively by each side in the violent civil war that followed his death. Which one was the prophet of God so horribly wrong about? Muhammad left his men with instructions to take the battle against Christians, Persians, Jews and polytheists (which came to include millions of unfortunate Hindus). For the next four centuries, Muslim armies steamrolled over unsuspecting neighbors, plundering them of loot and slaves, and forcing the survivors to either convert or pay tribute at the point of a sword. Companions of Muhammad lived to see Islam declare war on every major religion in the world in just the first few decades following his death - pressing the Jihad against Hindus, Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and Buddhists. By the time of the Crusades (when the Europeans began fighting back), Muslims had conquered two-thirds of the Christian world by sword, from Syria to Spain, and across North Africa. Millions of Christians were enslaved by Muslims, and tens of millions of Africans. The Arab slave-trading routes would stay open for 1300 years until pressure from Christian-based countries forced Islamic nations to declare the practice illegal (in theory). To this day, the Muslim world has never apologized for the victims of Jihad and slavery. There is not another religion in the world that consistently produces terrorism in the name of God as does Islam. The most dangerous Muslims are nearly always those who interpret the Quran most transparently. They are the fundamentalists or purists of the faith, and believe in Muhammad\"s mandate to spread Islamic rule by the sword, putting to death those who will not submit. In the absence of true infidels, they will even turn on each other. The holy texts of Islam are saturated with verses of violence and hatred toward those outside the faith, as well as the aforementioned \"hypocrites\" (Muslims who don\\'t act like Muslims). In sharp contrast to the Bible, which generally moves from relatively violent episodes to far more peaceful mandates, the Quran travels the exact opposite path (violence is first forbidden, then permitted, then mandatory). The handful of earlier verses that speak of tolerance are overwhelmed by an avalanche of later ones that carry a much different message. While Old Testament verses of blood and guts are generally bound by historical context within the text itself, Quranic imperatives to violence usually appear open-ended and subject to personal interpretation. From the history of the faith to its most sacred writings, those who want to believe in \"peaceful Islam\" have a lot more to ignore than do the terrorists. By any objective measure, the \"Religion of Peace\" has been the harshest, bloodiest religion the world has ever known. In Islam there is no peace unless Muslims have power - and even then...']\n",

            "['*Round 3 Rebuttals*Pro goes KCA:\"Everything that begins to exist has a cause.\"My response:First off, that\\'s a bare assertion, and quantum mechanics would disagree.https://profmattstrassler.com...Now, my favorite argument for god is in fact this one, the Kalam Cosmological Argument, because it was an attempt to take the infinite regress problem of \"everything that exists has a cause\" and change it so that god is exempt from the \"if it exists, it has a cause\" rule; this is a form of special pleading.http://www.logicallyfallacious.com...Before the Kalam argument, was the original cosmological argument that asserted that \"everything that exists has a cause.\" This turns into an infinite regress, because if god exists, according to the assertion, then god must have a cause, and god\\'s cause must have a cause, and god\\'s cause\\'s causes\\'s cause must have a cause etc...So, the Kalam takes an infinitive verb phrase \"to begin to exist,\" applies it to \"everything that exists has a cause,\" and changes the assertion to \"everything that BEGINS TO EXIST has a cause,\" which exempts god from being caused, because, thanks to special pleading, he\\'s always existed and never BEGINS TO exist.This argument is two-fold fallacious.A. It uses circular reasoning, or it begs the question.B. It special pleads god\\'s exemption.A. By saying that things \"begin to exist,\" you automatically create a set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" and a set of \"things that do begin to exist.\" The problem is that the set of \"things that don\\'t begin to exist\" ends up only having one thing in it, god, which makes separating \"begin to exist things\" and \"not beginning to exist things\" a way to smuggle in god\\'s presumed exemption in the conclusion.The assertion that a thing, god, didn\\'t begin to exist in the premise is simply repeated by saying that god is the only member of the \"didn\\'t begin to exist\" set in the conclusion, which is begging the question or circular reasoning.http://www.logicallyfallacious.com...B. By asserting that everything began to exist, except for god, you are special pleading god\\'s exemption to the assumed rule. Without an explanation of how god should be considered exempt from the category, exempting him is special pleading, thus it is flawed logic and we can reject the conclusions from such.Pro, other than bare assertions, like \"god is uncaused,\" how is god exempt from the beginning to exist rule that you openly endorse?Pro, could you explain the mechanism by which god accomplishes this exemption?If you can\\'t, then how do you know that this exemption has occurred?Pro continues:\"The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause.\"My response:Much like the process of creation, causation is also temporal.This means that time could not have been caused, because causation itself requires time.It\\'s like saying, \"time began to exist as the result of a time event that occurred BEFORE the existence of time.\"The temporal contradictions of creation and causation at [+0,-0] have not been addressed by Pro.Pro baldly asserts again:\"God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused.\"My response:Aside from this egregious tautology, Pro simply asserts that god was uncaused and provides no explanation as to how this is the case.I could just as easily assert that flagoiganberries are self existing beings, uncaused, and need no answer, and I would have accomplished the same level of demonstration that Pro has with his asserted god.Pro tried to draw a similarity between designed-by-human computers and the universe.I pointed out that if Pro is going to say that the universe was designed, which I also reject, like computers, then the universe, like computers, was designed by a natural, not supernatural, intelligence.Pro responds:\"To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\"My response:No, it\\'s another way of pointing out that your \"universe is like a computer\" analogy doesn\\'t support a supernatural entity like your proposed god.Instead, your analogy shows that natural designs come from natural agents, so if the natural universe was designed, your analogy would indicate that a natural entity was responsible; this is not indicative of a supernatural designer, the type of designer Pro is attempting to affirm.Pro continues:\"Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance.\"My response:Yeah, natural entities are responsible for these computer codes, hence why computer codes are not \"magical.\"Pro furthers:\"[Something magically popping into existence is] synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened.\"My response:Well, again, all of the examples EVER of video games have been shown to be designed by a natural entity, but we only have one example of the universe, and it has not been shown to be designed...the absurdity of the random video game manifestation contradicts the many examples of designed video games and is therefore nontransferable to the universe which has no standard examples with which to compare.Pro retorts:\"Con has...declared that there once was no time...time \"became\" at some point...since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist.\"My response:Ah, Pro addressed it finally.Creation and origin are not the same thing.creation - the process of bringing something into existence.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...origin - the point where something begins.http://www.oxforddictionaries.com...Time therefore had an origin, a POINT called the big bang, yet it did not experience a PROCESS of being created; that process must occur over time and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof.So, it\\'s NOT illogical to concede an origin, but not a creation.Creation is a series of events and an origin is a point; the terms are different.Pro stays adamant:\"Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause.\"My response:Again, this is like saying, \"Time was placed in motion in the first place by a time-based action.\"How can a cause, a thing occurring over time, happen without time?Pro adds:\"Without God, time and space never roll into motion...it would take a tremendous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from?\"My response:I guess Pro ignored all of my round 2...oh well, here it is in a different way.Quantum fluctuations are what nothing is, and this nothing is unstable; nothing cannot remain, so something, energy, is guaranteed.At [+0,-0], spacetime fluctuated in and out of existence with the other fluctuating variables in quantum fluctuations, but once matter became stative [+1,-1], so did space.At this point [+1,-1], space was as small as a virtual sub nuclear particle, so the proportion of stative energy from QF to such small space was massive...so massive that it drove the inflation of space.http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Pro reasons:\"If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is.\"My response:Did you look at my 2nd round, Pro?All of the answers are there and sourced.But to save you the scroll...Right, at [+0,-0], unstable quantum fluctuations have space, time, matter, and energy fluctuating in and out of existence such that there is no stative time or the passage thereof, thus no temporal concepts like creation/causation occur.But at [+0,-0], once a virtual sub nuclear particle avoids annihilation from its antiparticle, which is the inherent instability of QF, matter, energy, space and time are then stative [+1,-1] and this is the origin of the universe; it\\'s an origin, not a creation.Stative space at this point is so small that any stative energy is proportionally quite powerful-->inflation.Pro ignores my round 2 some more:\"Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint.\"My response:Though it\\'s not a cause, time and space in the first place is not only knowable, it\\'s been demonstrated by the WMAP from NASA.[+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations-->[+1,-1] Big Bang.Here\\'s the model again: http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...Pro gets bold:\"If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity.\"My response:Pro, read my round 2 thoroughly...and check NASA\\'s Big Bang Model that I\\'ve provided twice now.Pro finishes:\"If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless.\"My response:Let me translate.\"This gives a lot of room to the notion of a user of time-based actions that is timeless.\"Pro, do you see the contradiction in your assertions?If the creator is timeless, then why is he defined as a user of time i.e. a creator?', 'Thanks Pro for your response. I maintain that the universe was not created, because of the temporal problems of such a claim. Without a universe at [+0,-0], there is no stative time in order to correctly declare that a temporal process, creation, occurred; no time, no creation, no creator. But Pro doesn\\'t seem to see it that way... *Round 1 Rebuttal* Pro asserts: \"Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event.\" My response: Nope. I\\'ve explained, that without god, the universe has an origin, and, because there is no stative time in [+0,-0] quantum fluctuations, there is no infinity of time; time began when the universe began, so I guess this is our \"first mother.\" Pro asks: \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken.\" My response: Well, you didn\\'t ask me before your assertion about everyone. The egg came first, because mutations that lead to speciation occur in the zygote, which is inside the egg. Therefore, the predecessor to the chicken had a mutation occur within the egg that makes that egg a chicken egg, which lead to the first chicken. The egg came first. Pro continues: \"Many scientists have stated that if the fundamental physical constants were to vary even so slightly, the establishment of matter, astronomical constructs, elemental diversity, and life, as humans know it would have never happened. Reality is beyond a miracle.\" My response: No, you\\'re just calling an after-the-fact result a miracle. This doesn\\'t show there must be a creator, it just shows that the low odds of existence happened. Low odds do not necessitate purposiveness. *Round 2 Rebuttal* Pro claims: \"There is no empty space. There is a \"bubbling soup\" of quantum field fluctuations that come and go quickly.\" My response: I agree, and in this state at [+0,-0], there is no stative time. Instead, time is just another variable that \"comes and goes quickly\" with the other fluctuating variables. So when there was no universe, [+0,-0], time did not remain; it fluctuated. Pro adds: \"In the double slit experiment we see an interesting phenomenon of quantum strangeness. When nonobserved electrons cause patterns of waves. When observed, their behavior and pattern changes based on observation.\" My response: Yup. I fail to see what this has to do with quantum fluctuations or the creation of the universe/stative time, but the double slit experiment shows that particles can be both a particle and a wavelength. Pro then claims: \"SPACE TIME DOES NOT RESTRICT THE LORD\" My response: Aside from this being a bare assertion, the lack of spacetime restricts creation, a process that REQUIRES time to have occurred. No time, no creation, no creator, no created universe. Pro attempts to support this assertion with the bible: \"In the book of John, Jesus Christ made a statement concerning time and its relation to Him...in our sense of time Christ walked the Earth after Moses and Elijah had been dead and gone a long time.\" My response: Pro, why should we consider the bible authoritative on matters of time or the universe? So what if the bible says that \"Moses face was shining like the sun, and the Children of Israel put a veil over his face?\" What does any of this have to do with the creation of the universe? Pro makes another bare assertion: \"There is one way known to satisfy the paradox of infinite causes. If you can name another, go ahead.\" My response: [+0,-0] Quantum Fluctuations --> [+1,-1] Big Bang. Check my round 2 for sources on this. Pro continues: \"If you examine a computer and its constructs, you would know an intelligence created it.\" My response: Yeah, and every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity. So, applying this rule to the universe, you should conclude that something natural, not supernatural like god, was responsible. Also, we have only one example of a universe, unlike our many examples of computers from which we can deduce commonalities; or maybe Pro can find another universe that indicates his claim. Pro piles on: \"Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code...it isn\"t just random 1\"s and 0\"s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software.\" My response: Despite theawakenment.com\\'s lack of credibility on matters of the universe or existence, simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe. Pro goes on about genetic code: \"Genomes use the genetic code to write two completely separate languages. The first explains how proteins are made, and the other commands the cell on how genes will be controlled.\" My response: Ok, well when you have a debate about the origins of life, then maybe you could bring this up, but in a debate about the universe, this is irrelevant. Pro then provides a clip from the Matrix to explain \"What is real?\" All the clip shows is that there was a fictional movie made with Keanu Reeves...that\\'s it. Then Pro mentions: \"Einstein...demonstrated time as having a point.\" My response: Yeah, like the Big Bang. Pro adds: \"Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will.\" My response: Ok, but this puts Jesus as the result, not the cause. Pro furthers: \"In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model.\" My response: Nothing about the Big Bang model involves speaking anything...that Genesis mentions light and light is an elementary particle is coincidence and not indicative of Genesis\\'s authoritativeness on matters of the universe. Pro finishes: \"This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority.\" My response: How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself? I\\'m not attacking god, I\\'m attacking the TEMPORAL process of creation occurring without time...it\\'s inherently nonsensical. Pro should attempt to address the temporal problems of calling the origin of time \"creation.\" How do you discern creator from created without time? I reject this resolution, because, without stative time, temporal processes cannot occur.', 'I think this is gonna be a good one. I reject the claim that the universe was created at all, let alone by an agent, including a presumed god. To have something created, brought into existence per this debate, there needs to be stative time and the passage thereof to allow the process of creation to occur. Creation necessarily requires:1. a creator remaining long enough to create2. the action of this creator creating3. the subsequent existence of the created productWithout stative time and the passage thereof, a temporal process like creation, or bringing something into existence, is nonsensical. How could one discern a creator from its created product without the passage of stative time? Creators must precede their creations, and precedence, the fact of occurring earlier in time, requires stative time. I reject this resolution, because stative time\\'s origin and the universe\\'s origin are in fact the same, which negates a temporal process like creation from occurring without the universe. *THE UNIVERSE*All existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. Our universe has matter and space. Matter distorts space and creates gravity. . http://www.einstein-online.info...The way that particle physicists and cosmologists look at the total universe\\'s energy is by the totality of observable matter (you, me, the planets and stars) and gravity (distortions of space). . https://en.wikipedia.org...Matter, in this energy combination, acts as positive energy (+), because matter is doing the distorting. Gravity, in this energy combination, acts as negative energy (-), because it\\'s a result of the distorting. So, what if we could see how curved space is throughout the entire observable universe given this (+)matter and (-)gravity interplay? Well we can, and we have, using the WMAP, which is an anisotropy probe attached to a space shuttle that measures variations in the otherwise uniform Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, and gives us a massively accurate picture of the scale, shape, and size of the observable universe. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...We now know that our universe is flat, because the spacial curvature (the total effect of matter on space) of the universe is zero. . http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org...Therefore, all of the positive energy (+matter) is exactly being cancelled out by all of the negative energy (-gravity) in our universe, so that the total energy [+matter,-gravity] of the universe is in fact zero. As a set, the universe\\'s matter and gravity would look like [+matter, -gravity] = 0So, we could imagine what the set might look like currently, given our massive universe of +matter and -gravity. .. [+10000000000000,-10000000000000] = 0This shows lots of +matter and lots of -gravity exactly cancelled out. But when there was no universe, matter and gravity were at [+0,-0] = 0At [+0,-0], there is no matter or gravity to speak of and of course the total energy is 0. In this zero energy state, there is/are no radiation/particles/wavelengths/matter/energy/space/time/gravity. .. nothing [+0,-0]= 0. So, for this debate, I will be referring to the otherwise inaccurate phrase, \"before the universe,\" as [+0,-0], when there was no universe. *QUANTUM FLUCTUATIONS (QF)*In our universe of space and matter, when you strip \"something\" of particles, radiation, and energy, you are left with nothing but empty space; this empty space is full of quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations are sub nuclear particles (not actually full particles, which is why some physicists call them \"virtual\" particles) existing and being annihilated by antiparticles, and the forces between these sub nuclear particles fluctuate along with this existence and annihilation. I have to make this point perfectly clear. These sub nuclear particles fluctuating in and out of existence are what nothing is, and this is always the case. This is what nothing is. . http://scholarsresearchlibrary.com...The article above refers to quantum fluctuations as vacuum fluctuations because, in our universe of space and matter, we\\'ve detected these fluctuations by using a vacuum that strips the basics of something from empty space. But the sub nuclear particles in QF are something, right? Nope. They never statively exist; they exist and don\\'t exist at the same instant, and it is this fluctuation that makes up nothing. There is no \"nothing\" without these fluctuations, period. What is nothing? It is a state of fluctuating sub nuclear particles and their forces called quantum fluctuations. That video is short and explanatory of QF = nothing. Quantum fluctuations are as real as microorganisms, and we\\'ve demonstrated and measured their effect, in current space, in detail. . http://physics.aps.org...However, at [+0,-0], unlike our current universe, there was no space, and instead, like the forces between the sub nuclear particles, space and time fluctuated along with the sub nuclear particles. Space is merely the position of matter or the distance between matter; matter dictates space. At [+0,-0], in a quantum fluctuation, a sub-nuclear particle exists and is simultaneously annihilated by its antiparticle, and this pseudo moment allows for the fluctuated existence/nonexistence of space and time and the forces between the sub-nuclear particles; this was the condition at [+0,-0], which is a constant fluctuation of time/space/matter/energy/gravity thanks to QF. These zero-energy quantum fluctuations, nothing, are such an unstable state that energy is guaranteed to be expressed from them; that expression is called the big bang and is the origin of our universe. From nothing [+0,-0] to something [+1,-1] = The Big Bang. . http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov...*THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE - THE BIG BANG*Pro has already conceded that the Big Bang occurred, but in order to explain why the universe couldn\\'t have been created, by god or otherwise, I must explain our current understanding of the Big Bang model. With the right radio telescope, even you can see that the space between the stars above us isn\\'t just black space, it\\'s filled with microwave radiation. . http://science.nasa.gov...All of this CMB radiation, which is a \"black body\" as it absorbs all intercepted electromagnetic radiation, is nearly a uniform glow between stars across the universe, and is a proven indicator of an expandable hot dense state such as the Big Bang being the cosmos\\' origin. . http://www.mpg.de...The small variations in the microwave\\'s uniformity, show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot dense state that has expanded to the current size of the universe; this is called inflation. . http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk...Yeah, that link is from Cambridge. .. I know, argument from authority. .. go to page 9 of the PDF which is page 2 of the preface. These small variations have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by quantum fluctuations of sub-nuclear particles, had expanded to the size of the observable universe we see today. *THE RESOLUTION IS FALSE*Unfortunately for this resolution, at [+0,-0], in quantum fluctuations, there was no stative time, because there was no stative space. Space and time are part of a continuum, so we call it spacetime. . http://www.einstein-online.info...I reject the claim that the universe has a creator, god, because creation is a temporal process, contingent on stative time, and at [+0,-0] there was no stative time or the passage thereof, because there was no stative space; temporal processes like creation are nonsensical without stative time. Therefore, a creator of the universe cannot be, because there is no creator of a universe that wasn\\'t created.', \"*No acceptance round; just start debating.*Definitions can be changed, BEFORE ACCEPTING the debate, in the comments section, as long as both Pro and Con agree, otherwise...*Definitions below are agreed to by accepting the debate.ResolutionThe universe was created by god.ProHas the Burden of Proof and 4 sets of 10,000 characters to AFFIRM the resolution that the universe was created by god.

            "['Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The beginning of time/space began to exist or be put into motion, thus there must be a cause. God is a self existing being who was not caused, thus needs no answer for a cause because He is uncaused. Con stated: \"...every example of a computer we\\'ve ever known is designed by a natural, not supernatural, entity.\" To be clear, this is a synonymous way of saying \"humans created every computer we know of, not God.\" And humans are intelligent agents who designed these computers. * Con Stated: \"...simply because some codes resemble human-created codes doesn\\'t mean that these codes were designed or indicate a designer, unless Pro is claiming that Microsoft and Google created the universe.\" Microsoft and Google were created by humans, which are intelligent agents who created such software. Computer codes and mediums do not just magically pop into existance. It\\'s synonymous with saying Call of Duty 4 and its Construct randomly happened. We know this is impossible without an intelligent designer. And our reality is much more complex than Call of Duty 4. We are talking about Grand Theft Auto on super steroids in our case of reality. I assume Con does not believe in magic, nor do I. * Con said: \"How can this \"medium\" be created when this \"medium\" is the origin of time? How can you call it creation, when there was no time for the process of creation to occur without the \"medium\" itself?\" Con has with this statement declared that there once was no time. Time \"became\" at some point. This would indicate that time being put into motion in the first place was caused. He says that without time there \"could be no creation\", yet must cede that there was a \"creation\", whether by God or by something else all together, otherwise we wouldn\\'t exist. There was a beginning event that propelled the start of our reality of space and time. Since Con states there was no time to have a creation event, he is ceding that there could be no start event in the first place, which is illogical, seeing that we do exist. We need an agent to start the process that is beyond time, seeing that without time we can have no creation event otherwise, according to Con. Time and space placed in motion in the first place had a cause. What is that cause? God? Something else? Without God, time and space never roll into motion. A stationary time and space sounds nice, but potential is not potential at all without a cause. It\\'s like watching a leaf sitting in one spot for an hour. Suddenly it picks up, moves across the yard, and goes into motion. Why? It\\'s motion had a cause. Without the wind or some other external cause, the leaf would not move. Thus, it is the same with time and space. It would take a tremedous amount of energy to put time and space into motion. Where did the energy come from? If we are to believe an energy force put it all into motion, without time, how could this be? Con himself has stated that no creation event could happen without static time. The same applies to whatever his theoretical cause is. * Con must rebuttle by claiming some sort of cause that put time and space into motion in the first place. No matter what that answer is it is unknowable even from the atheistic viewpoint. If Con gives a theoretical cause of time and space going into motion, he needs evidence of this cause, otherwise it is a faith based assertion, and is no better an answer than a creator god or at best equal to the assertion of a creator in validity. * If time was stationary or \"not\" at all, this gives a lot of room to the notion of a creator that is timeless. So what do we know in accordance with Con\\'s assertion of stationary or nonexistant time. 1)Time did not exist/was not in motion, and yet we exist. 2)Whatever the cause is of the creation or putting into motion of time, is timeless and not affected by time, otherwise nothing would have happened, thus we would not exist. 3)If causes can be non-effected by time and be causes in the first place, then whatever is the construct of that system allows for a timeless creator. Something must be beyond time if Con\\'s assertion is 100% true. He must show evidence of a cause that is beyond time and space.', 'There is no empty space.

He is surrounded by mighty winds that destroy boulders, the Earth quakes, and then he sees a flaming fire consumed with the Lord\\'s voice, which is described as gentle and quiet. He begins speaking to the Lord. (1 Kings19:8) https://en.m.wikipedia.org... In our sense of time Christ walked the Earth after Moses and Elijah had been dead and gone a long time. In the New Testament Christ had a perplexing event where His disciples were terrified at what was happening and could not understand it. \"Moses and Elijah appeared before them, talking with Jesus.\" (Matthew 17:3) When whatever was happening initially stopped, Jesus turned towards them and... \"There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.\" (Matthew 17:2) When Moses prior, in Exodus, finished speaking to the Lord...

Well, let\\'s see what the Science Advisor to the President of the United States of America says. -James Gates, Physicist and Science Advisor to Barack Obama. James Gates and his researchers discovered something very intriguing buried within the mathematical equations of super symmetry. What did they find? They found computer code. Our reality is controlled by computer code, and not just any code. This is a specific type of code referred to as \"self correcting code\". Richard Hamming established this coding system building on the concepts of Claude Shannon. Thus it is sometimes called \"Hamming Code\". And it isn’t just random 1’s and 0’s either. Bizarrely, the code they found is code which is used in computer browser operating system software. http://theawakenment.com...

Let\\'s check it out. \"What is real\"? http://youtu.be... *In reality we do not need an answer for the answer if the answer is from beyond our reality. If the answer is from this reality, it demands an answer for the cause of every caused thing in an infinite regress. We must have a singularity somewhere. This singularity must come from outside, or beyond our reality. Once we establish it as the answer, we do not need an answer for the answer. When the answer comes from beyond our reality, it becomes a futile thing to attempt to define the construct of anything from beyond our reality. But, you know me. I\\'ll give it a go.Einstein referred to time interms of upper dimensions. He demonstrated time as having a point. From the point time could go in any direction as if in upper dimensional space, similar to how we move on a complex highway system, forward, to the left, up, then back down, and all around. Picture Christ as the point, the singularity if you will. From that point of \"time and space\" He can go to \"the beginning\". He can go to \"the end\". He exists as born, a man, creator, and finisher. He Himself said in the book of Revelation, \"I am the Alpha and the Omega. The beginning and the end.\" In 1 John he is referred to in the status of that all things that exist exist only from Him. In Genesis God spoke reality into existance with a burst of light, similar to the Big Bang model. In Revelation, God has come finishing it all. Via prophecy, God declared the beginning from the end. If He truely knows the end, He exists in the future, in the past, and in the present. He is omnipresent. This created medium belongs to Him, was created for Him, and is under His authority. He is timeless, immaterial, yet material all at once. He is the singularity. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient as a programmer can be all of those things over the worlds he creates, thus it is with God, yet with more complexity than man can comprehend. The Alpha is the cause of the beginning. The Omega is cause of the end.', 'Atheism is logically impossible. Without God we get a regress in infinite causality. Meaning, we must accept infinite history, which is synonymous with the logic of saying everyone has a mother, but there is no first mother. We have history, but no first history. We have events, but no first event. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ironically, everyone always says the chicken. Why? Because the human mind knows that we must have a first uncaused cause. It\\'s common sense. The concept of everyone having a mother, yet there being no \"first mother\" is obviously absurd and illogical. The same applies for causes. Everything was caused, but there is no first cause? It\\'s identical logic.

Wikipedia describes codon as such: \"A codon is defined by the initial nucleotide from which translation starts. For example, the string GGGAAACCC, if read from the first position, contains the codons GGG, AAA, and CCC; and, if read from the second position, it contains the codons GGA and AAC; if read starting from the third position, GAA and ACC. Every sequence can, thus, be read in its 5\\' to 3\\' direction in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence. With double-stranded DNA, there are six possible reading frames, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand.

            "['When you wrote: \"Kidnapper states \"yes we are breaking the law but everybody here understands that it is our tradition and you can\"t change it.\" (3.37) I believe you are mistaken about what part of the law the kidnapper was referencing. While it\"s true that kidnappers were aware that their actions were against the law, the breaking of the law discussed in the video is almost directly pertaining to the act of the kidnapping itself. They admit that taking someone off the street by force is wrong. What I don\"t necessarily see in your premise is how kidnapping on its own can be linked to the occurrence of rape. It\"s unlikely that they believed that their actions are contributing to the girl being eventually raped and most likely they were convinced they were simply following the tradition. The best man even states that if they were stopped by the police, they simply would have clarified that kidnapping was part of a wedding party, and that would most likely suffice as an explanation (20 mins-20 secs). Your claim: \"At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)\" has some determination problems as well. The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. I fail to see how the time interval between kidnapping of the bride in the video and her eventual decision to consent is conducive to her consenting to marriage and sex. At the time of consent during the wedding ceremony, the use of force during kidnapping seems already irrelevant in her decision making. When she says \"yes\" to marriage, she already has full autonomy and is undeniably aware that she can say \"no\" without any fear of harm being done to her. It is possible that, in the situation when she does not consent, the process of convincing her to marry could perhaps go on for days (15 mins-00 secs). In that case, mental and physical fatigue could be a contributing factor in obtaining consent and initial use of force during kidnapping could be linked to eventual sex. That though, has not taken place in the video. I do see problems with this claim as well: \"A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) \". Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).', 'The main principle regarding the act of rape seems to always be centered on the determination of consent by both parties at the time of the intercourse. Refusal and consistent resistance to being penetrated would be considered as sufficient evidence that a victim did not consent to have sex. But when you state in your second premise that \"most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted (160.7.4)\" we enter a gray area of judgment. I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of nonconsenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear. What non-traditional rape standard often is unclear about and what it fails to produce is a distinctive criterion of nonconsent. Your premise of \"nontraditional rape being quite similar to what happens in many bedrooms across America (161.4.1)\" seems to reflect that very notion. If all sex is coerced in some way (161.3.1); the line between consensual and forced sex can be unknowingly crossed at any point, and lack of consent is not properly communicated, is it not possible that cases of mistaken consent could be a regular occurrence? No two people are the same, so experiences with a certain similar group of people might be our only guide about typical behavior related to that group. It is possible that a man has repeated certain type of seductive behavior with a number of women and was never made aware by any of them that his actions went too far. At that point it is possible that he has determined certain aggressive behavior as acceptable. In \"Rape\" Susan Estrich uses an example of Pat and Rusk. Pat is a young woman who met Rusk at a bar and later gave him a ride home. At one point, when she declined twice to go up, he took her car keys and she followed him to his apartment. The two proceeded to have sex. While Rusk\"s action to grab car keys might seem to be excessively forceful and without a doubt surprised Pat, at no point in his room did he say or indicate that any harm would be done to her if she doesn\"t cooperate with his wishes. His controlling demeanor and aggressive tone caused Pat to assume and articulate possible negative consequences of nonconsenting, without there really being any evidence that would suggest possibilities of bodily harm. His decision to walk Pat to her car and ask if they could meet again would further imply that he might have been unaware of any wrongdoing (171.4-172.4). What Pat and Rusk example demonstrates is how difficult it is to determine intentions in a non-traditional rape; and how any situations, depending on each party\"s position, can be a subject to different interpretations. In bride kidnapping the only real use of physical force occurs during the kidnapping itself (12min30secs-15mins40secs). Assuming the resistance is not a preplanned part of the wedding proceedings, this is the only time that the woman\"s freedom is restricted and her pleas are ignored. After the bride regains her autonomy, she seems to make a conscious decision to continue the marriage ceremonies. Since the kidnapping is the only means of physical force that was used, it seems safe to assert that physical force or threat of physical force was not a factor in the women\"s decision to marry. Therefore it is important to examine whether psychological manipulation or fear was a decisive element in the bride\"s decision. Unlike the woman in \"Rape\", who\"s unfamiliarity of the man and her surroundings led to her consenting out of fear, the bride in the video has known the groom for some extended time and was romantically involved with him (4mins 40 secs). She was fully aware that she will not experience any harm if she does not agree to marry and the video indicates that her family was aware of her location. As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress. The bride in the video, after the initial vigorous resistance, just seems to give in way too easy; and only moments after she was given her freedom back. When you reference that kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice (27.15)\", I find it hard to believe that no other alternatives were available in this situation. There is no evidence she even considered or discussed other choices and, like you stated in your argument when you wrote: Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1). Additionally, your claim that \"she understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present\" is completely subjective as far as determining the presence of a choice inhibiting fear. Her assumed resignation to her fate should more likely be attributed to her upbringing in Kyrgyzstan, rather than fear of any repercussions as a result of saying \"No\". She was more likely brought up with an instilled knowledge that in a situation like this, its proper for her to eventually agree since it is a part of a long lasting tradition (27mins09secs).', 'In her article \"Rape\" Susan Estrich analyzes various cases of rape and identifies certain, ever present, elements that categorize the act of rape in two distinct groups: traditional rape and non-traditional rape. Traditional rape is mainly related to the \"use of force\" or a clearly articulated \"threat of force\", where intentions of a perpetrator are unmistakable and there is a definite absence of mistake. Non-traditional rape differs in a way that less force or no force is used, threats are not necessarily articulated and there is a possibility of mistake regarding consent (160.7-161.1). VICE documentary, \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\", looks more closely at the local Kyrgyzstan tradition of marriage by kidnapping, where a woman is taken off the streets and ultimately convinced to marry her kidnapper. The video follows actions of a young man as he is preparing to kidnap and marry his girlfriend. While there are elements associated with this event which could be interpreted as evidential of rape, certain circumstances surrounding this particular couple structure the following argument in a way that negates an occurrence of rape. 1.) The rape is defined by judging the victim\"s response to the act of having sex (162.2.4) 2.) Defining nonconsent is difficult in cases where certain cultures find it proper for female to act nonconsensual when pursued by male, even if she is actually consenting (177.5.2). 3.) The actions of the victim need to completely and beyond a doubt express the lack of consent (164.4.2). 4.) For a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1). 5.) For rape charge to be held, it is important to prove perpetrators intent and absence of mistake about consent (163.6.3). 6.) The man has known the woman for a long time and they have both discussed a potential marriage in the future (4 mins-45 secs). 7.) The marriage by kidnapping is a tradition in Kyrgyzstan that allows women to consent to marriage while still remaining \"innocent\" and not coming off as desperate to marry (16 mins-10 secs). 8.) Getting married by kidnapping could be a part of an agreement between the bride and the groom, where kidnapping part is staged by two parties (23 mins-05 secs). 9.) The woman showed she was capable of physical and verbal resistance (12 mins-33secs) but ceased to resist and express her nonconsent when she was given back her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). 10.) While having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says \"yes\" (26 mins-53 secs). 11). It\"s customary in Kyrgyzstan to have sex on the wedding night (30 mins-35 secs). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 12.) Since the bride willingly consented to marriage, the husband is not guilty of rape. Determining whether a traditional or non-traditional rape occurred is heavily based on establishing the presence of force or threat of force during or leading up to the act. The victim has to demonstrate clear, unquestionable resistance to taking part in the sexual act, either physically or verbally; or indicate that her consent is obtained through fear, where she believed not cooperating might result in a serious harm to her person. In cases of the traditional rape, where a stranger uses physical strength or weapon to overpower or completely intimidate the victim; uses threats of doing harm if she doesn\"t cooperate, and then proceeds to have intercourse with the victim, there is a very little question when it comes to the lack of consent and the resulting crime of rape (160.7.2-3). The determination becomes inherently more complex when it comes to the issue of non-traditional rape. Unlike the stranger with a weapon example, these cases might involve numerous circumstances where perpetrator and victim might have a mutual history or were engaging in the dating process. For majority of societies, romantic encounters and dating situations are characterized by an aggressive, pursuant behavior from men and passive behavior from women (161.5.2-3). For many women it is of the utmost importance to maintain an image that they do not easily engage in sexual relations; and even if they are willing to consent to intercourse, they might only communicate their intentions through subtle hints. The decision on the level of aggressiveness required in such cases will fall squarely on the male; and without clear guidance from his partner, it might be up to him to judge what constitutes acceptable behavior and what could be thought of as too forceful. If the female is too passive and unable to express her lack of consent, it is entirely possible that the male acted with an understandable notion that his partner fully consented by letting him take the charge (177.5). \"Bride Kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan\" could illustrates that exact point. The couple has been romantically involved for some extended amount of time. They discussed the idea of marriage and were both fully aware that marriage by kidnapping is a common tradition in their culture. Union through this type of tradition was even prevalent among their nearest family members, dating couple past generations (27 mins-10 secs). The girl\"s mother admitted to actually agreeing to a marriage by kidnapping, which could indicate the physical and verbal resistance during kidnapping was only a part of marriage proceedings and not a manifestation of her lack of consent (23mins -10 secs). That notion seems to be supported by her quick submission, especially after she regained her autonomy (15 mins-30 secs). Not only she stopped any form of resistance, but she seemed to be genuinely smiling while going along with the remaining proceedings. Even when given another chance to demonstrate her nonconsent and unwillingness to marry, the woman says \"yes\" when asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage. Since she agreed to be married and spend the weeding night with the groom, his actions in the video do not evidence that rape or nontraditional rape occurred.', 'When you state that \"The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from\" I believe you are missing the main point of my previous argument. The fact that rape occurs not only in the United States, but all over the world does not make the cultural importance of \"No\" means \"Yes\" philosophy in Kyrgyzstan irrelevant. I will argue that cultural connotations of that philosophy are directly relevant to the marriage by kidnapping tradition. The importance of local culture and tradition are the basis for judgment not only for the kidnapper, but also for the victim. It would be absolutely ignorant and culturally elitist to interpreted actions described in the video only from the viewpoint of an outside observer, where interpretations of the events are made strictly using one\"s own personal culture as comparison basis. While a person in United States might view the tradition of \"Bride Kidnapping\" as an unquestionable crime of rape, the culturally relevant observer might see that event as simply an everyday typical occurrence, socially valuable to Kyrgyzstan culture. Your claim that \"the law cannot protect a man because his traditions are different\" only applies when that tradition is not under the jurisdiction of that law. Indeed, the U.S law would not protect a bride kidnapper if he committed the act on U.S territory. You can\"t use the term \"law\" as something that has the exact universal meaning all over the world, because it obviously does not. What constitutes as punishment for theft in U.S might not even remotely be similar to type of punishment for the same act in other parts of the world. So when you again state: \"So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes it as a whole\" I feel you once more elected to rely on law standards not relevant to Kyrgyzstan and imposed law and social ideology discussed by Estrich, which mainly focuses on U.S law. Neither the groom nor the bride in the video is living under that set of law. The bride at no point in the video indicates that the actions taken by the groom was a violation of her person and she eventually accepts the events that unfolded as a natural occurrence, a part of her nation\"s tradition. She is initially upset for the way she was taken but that initial struggle is quickly replaced by realization that she is participating in that tradition, at which point she is willingly accepting the notion of getting married (27mins09 secs). In conclusion, I believe it is unreasonable to judge the young men in the video as a person who committed an act of rape. The use of force illustrated in the video and demonstrative lack of consent by the kidnapped woman was no longer relevant at the moment when the bride willingly agreed to become his wife. Even the initial harm done to her during the process of kidnapping was eventually interpreted by her as way of following the local tradition. The required in the crime of rape guilty intent was not present at any point during the act, from the moment of kidnapping to the wedding ceremony; everyone involved, including the bride, believed that following the tradition absolved him from anything that could be judged as intentional wrongdoing. If an argument could be made here, it is for the abandonment of the tradition itself on the moral basis, but the actions taken by the groom in the video do not evidence that a Rape of nontraditional rape occurred.']\n",
            "['Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 3 The following claims that you have made directly prove my argument. \"I agree it would be wrong to generalize physical resistance and verbal protest as the only means of non - consenting. Not every woman is capable of producing the same expressive reaction; there are cases where it is completely plausible that her defensive system would just simply shut down and she would be rendered helpless, unable to move or protest. That situation would definitely have characteristics of a non-traditional rape; if there are obvious indicators of force or threats of force that would cause the paralyzing fear.\" and \"As it seems unlikely that fear of being harmed was a contributing factor, we can assess whether the mental distress she experienced would be sufficient to qualify the grooms actions as an act of rape. I do agree that other examples of bride kidnapping could evidence rape. When a woman is taken off the streets by a stranger and subjected to extended process of being convinced to marry, it is not difficult to imagine her consent being obtained as a result of severe mental distress.\" It is exactly statements such as these that show the bride was pressured so severely that her mindset transformed into the idea that if she agrees; what follows would be the termination of the pressure and convincing from all of the woman that have surrounded her. Furthermore she understood through her tradition that these events of convincing can take minutes, hours, or even days, so it has been established that these convincing ceremonies could be endless. A man often times believes and practices that when some women say no , all they have to do is pressure them in a proper manner and it would result in her saying yes or in the least go along with that same act she never wanted to have any part in. ( 177.5.2) The following claim that you have made is irrelevant because the \"amount of time\" need not be specified in order to constitute grounds of rape. \"The main issue I have with this argument is that it doesn\"t specify what time frame is necessary between the use of force and the actual intercourse. Plus, it doesn\"t establish a set of circumstances required for the force to be interpreted as a key component in perpetuating the act of rape. In a hypothetical case where a man forcefully kidnaps a woman, holds her captive for an extended time, during which he slowly breaks her physically and emotionally to the point that when they actually have sex she is no longer resisting, I could see a direct correlation between the use of force on that first day and eventual submission of the captured woman. So even though, at the time of the intercourse, force was no longer present, the initial force used during the kidnapping was critical in the process that led to sex. \" It is legitimate to punish the man who chooses to ignore explicitly the words of protestation coming from that woman. With quite certainty if is safe and necessary to say that \"many women who say yes \" whether on dates or on the job \" would say no if they could ; I have no doubt that women\"s silence is sometimes the product not of passion and desire , but of pressure and pain.\" (181.1.1-2) Most importantly the amount of time that has passed between the kidnapping and the actual act of intercourse; is not basis to exculpate the kidnapper. At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 2 Your premise number four has proved exactly my point on the undeniable accusation that the kidnapper has performed an act of rape. Your premise goes as follows: for a charge to be considered a rape it is important to establish that force, a threat of force or manipulation through fear was used in order to perpetrate the act (164.3.1) It is exactly through manipulation and fear of force that the kidnapee agreed to the marriage. The bride to be confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she had no other choice but to stay and therefore agreed to the marriage. (27.5) This demonstrates the idea that women often feels that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) Further more the standard of physical force, or threat of it, to constitute sex as rape give men an easy opportunity to claim that from what they understood; the women gives consent to the act. (164.3.1) This demonstrates clearly that the bride to be had no choice but to say yes and agreed to the marriage on the grounds that she completely lacked power in any other choice. She understood that there is absolutely no other choice therefore her fear to act otherwise was clearly present. \"From a woman\"s point of view , the danger in this position where women -might in fact find themselves in a situation where they in saying yes really mean no- is that many women who say yes are in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say no.\" (177.5.1) Next, your tenth premise can be easily challenged. You have made a claim that \"while having full autonomy and being asked if she is willingly consenting to marriage the woman says yes\"(26.53) It is absolutely outrageous to somehow make out that this woman in the video was considered of her autonomy in any respect. If her autonomy was respected, first off she would not need to have been kidnapped in order for her to agree to a marriage with this kidnapper. The fact that the actual sex took place after the marriage is completely irrelevant because the sequence of events that led up to that night have stripped this woman completely of her autonomy, therefore leaving her no choice but to follow along with this situation which has consumed her. For the central role of consent, the justification in the law of rape is that it protects a woman\"s choice the autonomy of a woman in relations to sex. (175.4.1) Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) The following statements which have come directly from the video, reveal that the autonomy of the all the women was not considered in any of the following scenes: \"Father of groom states \"Be careful not to let her run away.\" (2.25) \"While a random bride is being dragged into the apartment she is pleading\" she does not want to stay and please let her go\" (2.51) \"There was a situation of a man and a woman who were in love, the woman wanted to marry him, but she explicitly explained that she did not want to be kidnapped and didn\\'t want to partake in anything following the kidnapping which and almost all cases consist of consummating the marriage. (3.14) \"After several years of marriage a couple is asked to reflect on the events that brought them together. The husband admits that when he met her he asked whether or not to send his parents for work or should he just kidnapped her right on the spot? and her response was \"don\\'t do it\" (3.58) \"When the male and all his friends went to retrieve his bride the young man states \"you can beat us or even cry\" they then proceed while the woman screams out to her mother as she kicks and screams. (12.39) \"Bride confesses that she did not want to get married at this time and since she was already taken they wouldn\\'t leave her alone anyhow so she have no other choice but to stay and agreed to the marriage. (27.5)', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 1 Author Patricia Smith makes it clear on what grounds and individual should be convicted of rape and she works beyond basic ideologies to show that rape in fact has occurred in some situations where it would be easy to think otherwise. Patricia Smith provides evidence to show that the kidnapper in the video in fact is guilty of rape. Most importantly she recognizes the distinction between negligence and purposefulness but stands firm that it is quite irrelevant to establish which of the two it is when convicting an individual of rape. She claims as follows: 1)In society both men and women have gotten used to the norms of male aggressiveness and female passivity. (161.5.2) 2)Most cases of rape are complex when no physical injury is inflicted. (160.7.4) 3)Rape is not the only crime where the relationship before the crime took place between the characters is considered by prosecutors in screening the case, but it has yet to be questioned whether or not considering the prior relationship in rape cases is less justifiable or different than considering it in an assault case. (160.2.4) 4)At times there can be a situation where there has been some time elapsed between the force and the intercourse. This situation is never the less threatening even if no explicate threat of harm has been communicated. (167.5.4) 5)Practically all jurisdictions have adopted \"force\" or \"threat of force\" grounds to which determined a rape has occurred. (167.5.1) 6)The central role of consent in the law of rape exists to protect a women\"s autonomy and a women\"s choice in the case of sexual relations. (175.4.1) 7)Women often feel that \"in this position many women who say \"yes\" are not in fact choosing freely but are submitting because they feel a lack of power to say \"no\".\" (177.5.1) 8)Kidnapee states \"since I was already taken, they wouldn\"t leave me alone anyhow so I knew I have no choice.\" (27.15) 9)When Bride is asked how she feels at the moment she explains how she wanted to cry earlier but now she is extremely tired. (26.27) 10)\"Understandably some men in our society have honestly believed in a different reality of sexual relations and that many may honestly view such situations differently than woman. But it is precisely because men and woman may perceive these situations differently and because the injury to woman stemming from the different male perception may be grave that it is necessary and appropriate for the law to impose a duty upon the men to act with reason and to punish them when they violate that duty.\" (166.6.2) 11)The conduct a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) 12)\"So, too, for threats of harm short of physical injury and for the deception and the false pretenses as methods of seduction. The powerlessness of women and the value of bodily integrity are great enough to argue that women deserve more comprehensive protection for their bodies than the laws of extortion or fraud provide for money.\" (181.2.1) 13)Through law men have a duty to be alert, keep their eyes open, and be sure of their situation before engaging in sex. A woman must be given credit for knowing that what she speaks is true instead of reading her mind. A blameworthy choice has been made by a man if he has the inherit capacity to act reasonably but fails to do so, which would result directly in the violation of the duty to which he was appointed. Regardless of the fact that negligent acts are less great than the acts imposed by purposeful conduct, being negligently sexually penetrated is still a grand issue. \" Being treated like an object whose words or actions are not even worthy of consideration adds insult to the injury.\" Part of the injury of rape is the dehumanization that ensures the denial of autonomy and dignity; and this can be demonstrated in both purposeful rape and negligent rape. (166.7.2-5) 14)Some feminists have argued that there needs to be a political revolution in order to counteract the traditional approach to rape, which is a failure. Unfortunately in most cases what passes as sex in our society, is in reality coerced. There cannot be any distinction between rape and what occurs in many bedrooms across our country. (161.3.2) 15)\"If in 1986 silence does not negate consent, at least crying and saying no should.\"(161.5.6) 16)A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable. (163.6.2) 17)A negligent rapist is still a rapist and should be punished. It is justifiable that knowledge of the risk is sufficient enough to determine blame. (165.5.1-2) _______________________________________________________________________ 18)The kidnapper is guilty of rape. Although this kidnapper seems to have overcome the female where she feels she has no choice but to go along with his plan; that does not provide legitimate means to prove that he is not guilty of rape.', 'Sandra Nisanov Phi/Law 310.08 Round 4 When you say this: \"Only in the recent years and mainly in the western cultures, the dating practice of aggressive male and passive female has been slowly phased out and replaced by more equal approach of two confident in their wants and desires adults meeting up for romantic purposes. Diminished focus on social stigmas related to dating and increased urbanization to big cities, where negative reputation and notoriety is less significant than in small villages or cities, greatly contributed to women in these cultures no longer feeling an obligation to play the role of a passive female at the risk of any public shaming. In these modern cultures women can properly articulate their feelings and \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is less likely to be practiced. Circumstances above definitely do not apply to the case in the video. The location in Kyrgyzstan is a very rural area and showcased society seems to follow old fashion, patriarchal way of thinking when it comes to gender roles and what behavior is appropriate for women. The \"no\" means \"yes\" philosophy is very much relied on in male/female relations. It is explained that answer \"No\" is associated with female purity and innocence, while saying \"Yes\" will be identified with negatively perceived characteristic of being desperate to get married (16 mins-15 secs). A lot of importance is being placed on the idea of purity for women, as evidenced by public display symbolizing girl\"s virginity on her wedding night (30 mins-30 secs). If we additionally consider that bride\"s mother actually agreed to be married by kidnapping, meaning her resistance and protest was most likely a staged performance, it is virtually impossible to determine if this is a case of \"No\" means \"No\" or not (23mins-05 secs).\" you are further proving my point as to why the law should address all areas as well as all individuals with the same respect. The fact that we as a society or culture are a bit more progressive here in the United States is irrelevant because there have been at least one or more instances where rape has occurred even in today\\'s society where the location is a progressive region in the United States. The law cannot protect a man just because his traditions are different. The fact that this rape has not taken place in the United States is irrelevant because the acts that this man committed are grounds to determine a rape has taken place no matter what region you are from. Because of the traditions there, the society is more patriarchal therefore often times favoring the men in the criminal law. This does not necessarily mean that rape has not taken place.\"Most of the time, a criminal law that reflects male views and male standards imposes its judgment on men who have injured other men. It is boys rules applied to a boys fight. In rape the male standard defines a crime committed against woman, and the male standards are used not only to judge men but also to judge the conduct of woman victims. Moreover, because the crime involves sex itself, the law of rape inevitably threads on the explosive ground of sex roles, of male aggression and female passivity, of our understandings of sexuality \" areas where differences between male and female perspective may be most pronounced.\" (160.4.4-7) Rape cases almost entirely disregard the defendant, and focus on the behavior of the victim, which is based on a male standard of what is appropriate behavior of a woman. (162.2-3) \"The study of rape as an illustration of sexism in the criminal law also raises broader questions about the way conceptions of gender and the different backgrounds and perspectives of man and woman are encompassed within the criminal law.\" (160.4.1) So to make it clear what constitutes as rape cannot be different in one country then it is in another. The law must recognize rape and what constitutes as a whole. If one individual murders another one what follows is necessary punishment regardless of what region you are from. The same concept should be applied to rape. One cannot be punished differently or not even accused of a crime which would have different circumstances in the for example the United States or any other progressive region. The conduct of a reasonable man should be evaluated by the law as opposed to being influenced by a playboy Macho philosophy which insinuates,\" no means yes\" but by valuing the words of a woman. (161.5.5) A man who claims he thought a woman was consenting, or didn\"t bother to think about it should always be compared to what a reasonable man would do in that sort of situation where he would have clearly known that there was no consent present. In this case the negligence of the man who did not bother to think about mistaking the non consent for consent from the woman, should be punishable. (163.6.2)']\n",
            "['When mentioning Long beach, California, I wasn\\'t contrasting it from other states. I was simply explaining the impact that school uniforms potentially had on a neighborhood. Secondly, abuse and discipline are two different things. Although some people may argue that it is a form of discipline, abuse does not necessarily correspond with it. As you stated, \"depression and PTSD are some of the long term effects when discipline becomes abuse\", shows that abuse is the reason of the depression and not the discipline itself. Ask yourself, would you discipline your children? Or would you let them tell you what they want to wear because their friends are all wearing it. If you think about it they wear a uniform whether it\\'s identical or not.', \"There is no way to show that conformity at a young age, elementary school and some high schools, would make children machines. Discipline is important at an early age in a child's life. Without Discipline, children will grow up not knowing how to face certain obstacles. Then there is also the the respect factor, without discipline it can be said that there will not be respect for others. According to lbschools.net, Schools where uniforms are required have seen a 95 percent decrease in crime, 90 percent decrease in suspensions, and vandalism on school property decreased by 69 percent. Also in Long Beach, California, where school uniforms are required almost everywhere since 1995, the average cost of uniforms per year is roughly $60 to $70.\", 'School uniforms help schools portray discipline. It keeps schools somewhat in check. Usually public schooling doesn\\'t require uniforms, some do, while catholic schools try to keep a uniform a requirement. According to Statisticbrain.com, Parents spend roughly 1.3 billion dollars annually on school uniforms, which breaks down to about 249 dollars per parent per year. That would be much cheaper than trying to get the newest clothing per year and spending money so that the child can have a new outfit of the \"coolest styles\" each day. School uniforms also try to keep the school itself united. The uniforms help diminish economic and social barriers between students. (greatschools.org)']\n",
            "['To properly conclude, the speaker has brought many valuable points to the discussion. However, these methods are not always sound. To begin, the speaker compares to Long Beach, California, even though it has a higher per capita murder rate of 7.4% to 5.1% of NYC (baruch.cuny.edu). Clearly, this should not be possible with lbschools.net, boasting a 90% decrease. Frankly, it seems like inflated numbers, using a small sample space to predict the population, instead of using larger ones. Regarding disciple, \"Depression and PTSD are some of the long-term effects when discipline becomes abuse\" (CNN.com). To have much of it, regardless of corporal or not, is not useful. Nevertheless, this was a wonderful debate that yielded many valid solutions.', \"As the speaker may have valuable points such as discipline, it still causes horrendous conformity. Simply put, conformity and discipline is like the military; such an act on small children in early education makes them machines. With Syria, that worn torn country has emboldened students with their blue uniforms (washingtontimes.com). Clearly, this is contradictory to “land of free.” To add, it apparently “[interferes] students' right to choose their dress…[Violating] First Amendment rights (Mitchell and Knechtle, 2003).” Thus, apparently this is militarization and constitutional infringement. With finance, parents should know how to spend wisely; if they afford new “kicks” every season, they certainly can afford at least 7 pairs of clothes.\", 'School uniforms, in general, seem to stretch the notion of assertion over students. There may be advantages with respect to fashion conservation, but it still destroys the concept of independence and art. In reality, wearing such uniforms brings a relatively stable nation like America, more like that of Syria, where uniforms are required by students, as well as longer class days (everyculture.com). If there is not a decrease in student morality, then certainly there can be one in their artistic flare. As the sun-sentinel.com suggests, wearing “uniforms stifle creativity” implying that to be creative proposes to not wear them in the first place (material conditional then modus tollens). While they may have their benefits, they harm far more.']\n",
            "['Yes everyone can agree that animals are not evil because they do not have a higher intelligence to think about that, and we can agree that natural disasters can be considered not evil since they are not a alive thing with any form of intelligence. I would think that evil would lie with humans. And yes what is evil may be subjective in the form of small things like animals I am talking big league when it comes to evil. For example, Hitler is evil his motives may seem good at first however in the end his motives was because he was a selfish dick who wanted more than he had and he died from it, of course before his death he killed 11 MILLION people you can not justify that as good. That was plain and simple evil', 'I look forward to what you have to say', 'You say that evil does not exist from the points you made so this is what I will do. Lets see what you said There is no objective evil? Not true the best example I have ever heard for evil is, evil for evils sake, which means no ending purpose, just for the hell of it Like I said with the one above there is a direct point of view of evil IT does not change what people think of it does, again you have to look at it objectively which most people can not do You can infact measure evil, here is a article I found with what most would consider a accurate scale about evil http://www.npr.org... So for my final thing I just want to say, everyone can agree that good exist in the world yes? then you believe in evil and the reason why is because for good to exist there needs to be a opposite so we can know the difference. Like for light to exist then dark has to, it is the same principle. That is why evil does exist', \"But that's thing thing Hitler did not do it because he thought it was best, he did it because he thought that he and all who looked similar to him was better than everyone else. Yes the mass populace may say that this is bad and that is bad but you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad .For example in the holocaust Hitler killed more than Jews he killed EVERYONE that was not a perfect arion which is why it was evil he did not do it for the best of Germany he did it because he wanted to and he thought he was better and that arions were better, so saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\"]\n",
            "['the Google definition of evil is \" profoundly immoral and malevolent\" and exist as \"have objective reality or being\" Evil is an idea that can not exist in the real world The idea of evil by its nature is subjective. You may think an action is evil but another person may claim it is good. For example one may believe that killing any living thing is evil, where others may say that killing animals is just part of life. Here are some questions than may arise. Who\\'s beliefs are correct? and what if killing one things saves five others? Is an evil action always evil or can exceptions be made? and finally how gets the right to answer these questions? so evil is clearly not objective I also want to talk about volition. Most people would agree that killing is immoral. An earthquake may kill people but an earthquake is not malevolent, it has no will to kill people. Most would agree that an earthquake is not evil it has no freewill. Say some is killed by an animal for food is that animal evil? It is just following its instincts it did not relay have an active choice in the madder. People also follow there instincts and there brain reacts to outside stimulus. so if the brain controls peoples actions, and has no power over the outside world can they relay be evil or act evilly? I would say no. I also want to say morals change with time, and what one group thinks is immoral another might have no issue with, so I ask can something be evil today and not be evil in say 100 years? There is no way to measure or quantify evil, and there are a lot of grey areas about what is and is not considered evil. this lack of agreement shows the frail nature of the idea of evil, and its inability to exist in the world.', 'A short debate with 3000 characters per round.', 'You have yet to convince me that evil exist and I think I have made some compiling arguments against the idea of evil.I want to quickly comment on some of your last points You say Hitler did not think it was for the best, he do it because he thought aryans where better than everyone else, but those are not exclusive he could think and did think both. He wanted to have the people he thought where best to run things because if they where the best, giving them power would be for the best. Hitler also was not aryan, so he clearly was just not thinking about himself. Also on that point just because it was not best for Germany does not mean he did not think it was best for Germany.You said \"you have to look at it objective to really see if something is bad\" I agree with the sentiment, but since there is no objective bad, nothing can be called really bad. This idea also works for evil, since there is no objective evil there is nothing that is truly bad.The final thing I will say on your points, you said \"saying he was not evil is the same as saying a serial killer is not evil for murdering someone\" with this you are not wrong I would say a serial is not evil same as I would not call Hitler evil. more so in the case of serial killers, many of whom have mental disorders. I would say in cases of serial killers with a disorder it is not to different from the animal killing people, and we agreed that the animal is not evil.To bring it all together, evil is not real because1 There is no objective evil 2 Ideas of evil change and vary -This is why people who kill like Hitler are not evil, but we can agree it is tragic that the people where killed. 3 It can not be measured or Quantified', \"First I would agree that what happened to the Jews in W.W.2 was tragic, and that Hitler played a huge role in that tragedy and is an undesirable human.

I want to make a more abstract example, say there is an election, I think candidate A's views are immoral and and bad for the country, but that does not make him evil. I have my right to think candidate A is immoral but it does not make him immoral. The lack of evil does not mean that people still can't think this or that about anything. One could even think that someone is evil, but it does not make it so, same as one thinking the world is flat makes the world flat. I want to comment that just because something is not good that does not mean it is evil.

            "['I fully welcome my opponent\\'s unconventionality, and shall follow suit. Since my opponent has not justified his framework, not has he made positive arguments generally (as opposed to assertions), I am free to do the same. I will, in this round, present two arguments, each negating the resolution, based on two contrary assumptions (the first, that a constitution may have authority extended through time, and, the second, that a constitution cannot), such that, no matter what my opponent makes of the framework in which I am working, my conclusion is inevitable. Note that this is in direct opposition to my opponent’s unwarranted decree that “Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed” – I must only argue that it should not be a living document (which includes an utterly impotent, and, therefore, de facto nonexistent constitution). I do not challenge my opponent’s acceptance of “natural rights”, but the exact list of rights he is accepting must be clarified before discourse may be had. So that there exists no ambiguity, I will operate with the assumption that the primary right is the Right to Autonomy, which has corollaries: the Right to Property and the Right to Self-Ownership. The Right to Autonomy states, generally, that each man has the right to exercise their own free will; the Right to Property that each man has the right to act exclusively over unclaimed material or material within his domain (this right also establishes the right to domain); the Right to Self-Ownership that each man must be treated as property of only themselves (unless they sign themselves into slavery), which, as explained, implies that they have exclusive control over their own person. If my opponent wishes to challenge any of these rights, I will present their justifications. The way my case is constructed means that, if my opponent cannot show that the Constitution is not “dead”, then it does not and should not have authority. Therefore, many of my opponent’s arguments work towards my conclusion. To give the foundation of my argument, I present passages from Lysander Spooner’s No Treason/Constitution of No Authority. Quoting the noble man on why Constitutions bind only those who signed them, and only on the terms that they signed them under: “Those persons, if any, who did give their consent formally, are all dead now. Most of them have been dead forty, fifty, sixty, or seventy years. And the constitution, so far as it was their contract, died with them. They had no natural power or right to make it obligatory upon their children. It is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that they could bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt to bind them. That is to say, the instrument does not purport to be an agreement between any body but “the people” then existing; nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right, power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but themselves. Let us see. Its language is: “We, the people of the United States (that is, the people then existing in the United States), in order to form a more perfect union, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” It is plain, in the first place, that this language, as an agreement, purports to be only what it at most really was, viz., a contract between the people then existing; and, of necessity, binding, as a contract, only upon those then existing. In the second place, the language neither expresses nor implies that they had any right or power, to bind their “posterity” to live under it. It does not say that their “posterity” will, shall, or must live under it. It only says, in effect, that their hopes and motives in adopting it were that it might prove useful to their posterity, as well as to themselves, by promoting their union, safety, tranquility, liberty, etc.” And on why those bound by it must have signed it of their own accords: “The laws holds, and reason declares, that if a written instrument is not signed, the presumption must be that the party to be bound by it, did not choose to sign it, or to bind himself by it. [...] Neither law nor reason requires or expects a man to agree to an instrument, until it is written; for until it is written, he cannot know its precise legal meaning. And when it is written, and he has had the opportunity to satisfy himself of its precise legal meaning, he is then expected to decide, and not before, whether he will agree to it or not. And if he do not THEN sign it, his reason is supposed to be, that he does not choose to enter into such a contract. The fact that the instrument was written for him to sign, or with the hope that he would sign it, goes for nothing. Where would be the end of fraud and litigation, if one party could bring into court a written instrument, without any signature, and claim to have it enforced, upon the ground that it was written for another man to sign? that this other man had promised to sign it? [...] The very judges, who profess to derive all their authority from the Constitution — from an instrument that nobody ever signed — would spurn any other instrument, not signed, that should be brought before them for adjudication. […] Moreover, a written instrument must, in law and reason, not only be signed, but must also be delivered to the party (or to some one for him), in whose favor it is made, before it can bind the party making it. The signing is of no effect, unless the instrument be also delivered. […] The Constitution was not only never signed by anybody, but it was never delivered by anybody, or to anybody\\'s agent or attorney. It can therefore be of no more validity as a contract, then can any other instrument that was never signed or delivered.” [2] Prong the First: If a Constitution is to Have Authority, it Must Not Change This is obvious by the fact that a contract is binding only insofar as it was consented to, and that “progress”, no matter to what end, would obliterate the ability for the terms of a contract to be specified (and therefore it could not be agreed to – empty and tabula rasa contracts are not contracts). Prong the Second: If a Constitution Changes, and Therefore Has No Authority, it Must be Discarded My opponent’s arguments mostly reject the consistency of our Constitution, and, therefore, we move to this prong. This conclusion is clearly given when one accepts that an improper contract is not binding; therefore, my opponent has shown that a living Constitution would be impotent, and, therefore, neither practically nor morally desirable. In addition, my opponent must recognise the difference between holding that a specific Constitution, by definition enduring, should be living, and that morally bankrupt Constitutions should be destroyed and replaced by More Perfect ones, and, if such replacement is impossible, just destroyed. My opponent needs to justify why the first would have been morally superior for, for example, Rome.', 'I accept.', 'what a clown', 'On Framework Note, here, that my opponent claims to have accepted my list of rights. Afterwards, he argues against the primacy of autonomy (saying that it must be compromised in the advance of something “greater”). He must have been very confused; there is no other explanation for this massive lapse in understanding. I specifically noted that the Right to Autonomy was the “primary right”, and other rights were corollaries. Given that my opponent has still presented no justification for his framework except for saying, descriptively, that certain things are “just” or “respectful of dignity” (which my opponent seems to believe counts as proving it so), there is absolutely no reason to accept the “appended” rights he tries to tack onto my own framework. Indeed, the very fact that he ACCEPTS my framework and then argues against its fundamental nature should be enough to discredit his attempts at consistency. The question one must first ask in this debate is \"By what standard am I to pass moral judgement?” I pose one simple challenge to both my opponent and the reader: find any answer which does not, at least implicitly, require autonomy of the Will. You will find that you cannot. This being so, it is clear that, unless my opponent decides to finally offer a positive argument, my a priori true position must be accepted prima facie. Defence1. Consent of the Governed Quoting Ayn Rand: “A right is the sanction of independent action. A right is that which can be exercised without anyone’s permission. If you exist only because society permits you to exist—you have no right to your own life. A permission can be revoked at any time. If, before undertaking some action, you must obtain the permission of society—you are not free, whether such permission is granted to you or not. Only a slave acts on permission. A permission is not a right.” It should be clear that I am not arguing that justice is “up to a vote”, or whatever other ridiculous position my opponent wishes to paint me as holding; justice is the protection of consensual relations and the destruction of all others. This is much different – justice is not “majority rules” or arbitrary under my theory, but, rather, justice itself is the principle of free association with the world and others. This is why my opponent’s rant about how “What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people“ falls flat; that which professes to protect rights cannot itself be a slavemaster. Thus, my opponent’s strawman is burnt to a crisp. The point made by my opponent about “practicality” is also worthless; is the unjust, then, to become just because it is expedient? I see no reason why one cannot consent to everything done to them; my opponent has a totally unjustified pessimism towards freedom. Also, I do fully believe that starving is oftentimes consensual. I have no problem biting the bullet; it’s your job to show why I’m wrong even if I do get around your silly reductios. Moving to another of my opponent’s scattered chains of twisted logic, he takes for granted that doing “beneficial” things is never unjust. This, while literally true, attempts to smuggle something past the reader: it assumes that non-beneficial actions actually are, in order to prove their moral acceptability. This is a ruse. He says himself that the reason the theft of the apple is a crime is the absence of consent. There are no two ways about this: Pro has unequivacly conceded that a possible distinguishing factor of a criminal act, as opposed to any other act, is a lack of consent. This, in itself, torpedoes the argument that consensual action is not an end in itself (and also the idea that “kind things” are always just). If that done without consent is criminal (and therefore unjust), and benevolent actions are always just, nonconsensual actions must always be unbeneficial. Q.E.D. I leave you with this unjustified, out-of-context segment of Robert Nozick (Anarchy, State, and Utopia is very relevant here) that should, in itself, be just as weighty as my opponent’s unjustified, out of context segments of Dworkin, and far weightier when taking into account my positive arguments for my framework: “Political philosophy is concerned only with certain ways that persons may not use others; primarily, physically aggressing against them, A specific side constraint upon action toward others expresses the fact that others may not be used in the specific ways the side constraint excludes, Side constraints express the inviolability of others, in the ways they specify, These modes of inviolability are expressed by the following injunction: \\'Don\\'t use people in specified ways,\\' An end-state view, on the other hand. would express the view that people are ends and not merely means (if it chooses to express this view at all), by a different injunction: \\'Minimize the use in specified ways of persons as means.\\' Following this precept itself may involve using someone as a means in one of the ways specified, Had Kant held this view, he would have given the second formula of the categorical imperative as, \\'So act as to minimize the use of humanity simply as a means,\\' rather than the one he actually used: \\'Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end. Side constraints express the inviolability of other persons, But why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm: we go to the dentist to avoid worse suffering later; we do some unpleasant work for its results; some persons diet to improve their health or looks; some save money to support themselves when they are older. In each case, some cost is borne for the sake of the greater overall good, Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good? But there is no social entity with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. Nothing more. What happens is that something is done to him for the sake of others. Talk of an overall social good covers this up. (Intentionally?) To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has. He does not get some overbalancing good from his sacrifice, and no one is entitled to force this upon him-least of all a state or government that claims his allegiance (as other individuals do not) and that therefore scrupulously must be neutral between its citizens.\"2. Rome (An Exercise in Inconsequentialism) My opponent makes the rather unconvincing argument that, had the Romans made a new Constitution, it would likely itself have been in opposition to liberty, and thus the proper thing to do is not to make a new Constitution. The problem is obvious: I did not advocate for the creation of any Constitution, only a Constitution of a certain… constitution. Unless my opponent is fully committed to the idea that it is physically and logically impossible that such a Constitution be created, he must admit that it is possible, and thus relevant to the moral discourse. If this is done, it is clear that, of the choices, a new and truly just Constitution would be the obvious best. In conclusion, I wish the reader to keep in mind that my opponent constantly appeals to dignity. I ask: What is more dignified? Self-determination or subjugation? To quote, again, Senpai Nozick: “The minimal state treats us as inviolate individuals, who may not be used in certain ways by others as means or tools or instruments or resources; it treats us as persons having individual right with the dignity this constitutes. Treating us with respect by respecting our rights, it allows us, individually or with whom we please, to choose our life and to realize our ends and our conception of ourselves, insofar as we can, aided by the voluntary cooperation of other individuals possessing the same dignity. How dare any state or group of individuals do more. Or less.”']\n",
            "['Thanks to Shab for accepting this battle to the death debate.Untraditionally, I will not be laying out a framework for this debate yet. Instead, I am merely going to present facts this round, which I will use to make my case in the next round. Assume that my framework is natural rights; if Con doesn\\'t contest, this is the framework we will use. Con must argue that the Constitution should be a \"dead\" document to succeed. Accordingly, these facts I present will be used in the next round to accomplish two objectives: 1) to show that the Constitution should be living, and 2) to show that the Constitution should not be dead. Because it can only be one or the other, judges should treat both types of arguments as positive arguments that advance my case. How the Founders Intended It?Significant hullabaloo is raised by some in defending the \"original\" Constitution. However, the Constitution from its inception was actually intended to be a living document, according to a significant number of its creators and ratifiers. The Constitution was not a coherent statement of ideology, outside of certain vague commitments to liberty. It was the product of compromise (1). Specifically, the compromise was between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. The Anti-Federalists would find camaraderie among the originalists today. The Federalists included John Marshall, a delegate to the Virginia convention to ratify the Constitution, and the fourth Supreme Court justice, responsible for the creation of judicial review (2). It is important to note that judicial review stems from no explicit constitutional authority authority whatsoever--it is truly one of the first and most famous examples of the living constitution, far before the phrase was coined. We can indeed see this same evidence of two interpretations of the constitution in the debate over the Repeal Act in 1803--\"[T]he Federalists urged that the constitutionality of the Repeal Act be referred to the Supreme Court. The Republicans responded that the people, not the courts, were the judges of the constitutionality of acts of Congress\" (2, pg. 313). Furthermore, \"Only 11 of the 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention, according to Madison\\'s notes, expressed an opinion on the desirability of judicial review. Of those that did so, nine generally supported the idea and two opposed\" (3) We\\'ll return to Justice Marshall later, but for now it is enough to say that originalism was not the doctrine of the Founders. I will explain the importance of this in Round 2. Judicial Review--In Defense of Liberty The GPO has published a handy-dandy list of things deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court (4). Of particular note are cases 150, 144, 140, and 133. I will not use them now, but I have acknowledged that as a courtesy to my opponent. The fundamental fact about rights is that, by definition, they cannot be subjected to a vote. Either they exist, or they do not exist, and woe be to the positivist that ascribes only the \"rights\" they like to the people they like--if rights are mutable, they are not rights. A dead constitution necessarily entails that we rewind our conceptions of rights, and of morality, to an earlier, worse time. More than just judicial review, the living constitution approach ensures that the Constitution is a document worthy of respect. The law is not an end, it is a means to the end of the public good. There is no quality of law that gives it an intrinsic utility or moral worth. Even the law of a religious society with religious law is worthless if the law is not followed. To the extent that the law protects the public welfare, it is worthy of praise; to the extent that it damages the public welfare, it is worthy of scorn. One of the great successes of the Living Constitution recently has been Obergefell v. Hodges. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down bans on gay marriage because of the Due Process and Equal Process clauses (5). Both clauses clearly were not meant to apply to gay marriage, and it is doubtful the Founders would have supported gay marriage. Yet, because of the actions of the Supreme Court, gay marriage is legal, and it is guaranteed to remain legal. No legislature can change that. The Living Constitution approach has successfully ensured that the Constitution remains a document worthy of respect that preserves the rights of the people. Rome Quite the segue, eh? This section demonstrates the harm caused when constitutions--in this case, the unwritten Roman Constitution--are insufficient to provide for the people. The beginning of the end of the Roman Republic is generally traced to the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus (6, pg. 144). Rome was in dire straits. The poor filled the streets of Rome, and wealth continued to be concentrated in the hands of a few (pg. 145). Tiberius pushed for land reform. Tribunes, as it happened, all had the power to unilaterally veto any proposal, and one by the name of Marcus Octavius did just that (146-147). The common people wanted reform (147). The law was intransigent. The natural response? Tiberius convinced the assembly to eject Octavius from office, a step with no legal precedent (147). For his trouble, Tiberius was murdered by the pontifex maximus and a mob of senators and retainers (147). This set the stage for enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic. A dead constitution goes the way of the optimates--into extinction and irrelevance. It can preserve no freedom in the long run, because it preserves only itself. A living constitution, on the other hand, would have bypassed many of the problems traditionalist Rome had with the populares. It would have enabled Tiberius and others to enact the will of the majority while preserving the rest of the Roman institutions. Attempting reforms under a dead constitution is like attempting a surgery with a battleaxe. You\\'ll get the problem area cut out just fine--and a few other vital organs while you\\'re at it. The scalpel of the living constitution is necessary to preserve this stability.ConclusionIn this round, I demonstrated several strengths of a living constitution, and provided necessary historical context for understanding my case. A living constitution more effectively protects liberties, more effectively allows for reform, and was favored by a good number of the Founders.Sources http://law2.umkc.edu...

The Romans: From Village to Empire by Boatwright et al.', 'Other than that, everything (excluding blatantly anti-debate practices like Google Doc links to avoid the character limit) is fair game. Definitions\"Should\" implies moral desirability. A \"living constitution\" is one that \" . . . changes over time, and adapts to new circumstances, without being formally amended\" (1). Generally, this interpretation is opposed to originalism, which states that \"those who make, interpret, and enforce the law ought to be guided by the meaning of the United States Constitution—the supreme law of the land—as it was originally written\" (2).

I'm posting to avoid the forfeit glitch.For now, I concede. Hopefully we can do this again some time--I have some major fixes I made to my argument and I've learned not doing arguments in the first round was a poor strategy, lol.GG WP\", 'I accept Con\\'s list of rights, but I will also add a list of my own. The exhaustive list of rights is everything that is necessary to provide equal respect and concern for all citizens. According to Ronald Dworkin (Justice for Hedgehogs), \"Someone\\'s total freedom is his power to act in whatever way he might wish, unimpeded by constraints or threats . . . His negative liberty is the area of his freedom that a political community cannot take away without injuring him in a special way . . .\" (366). The distinction between the two is important. Borrowing from a secondary source,Dworkin believes that a right to liberty in general is too vague to be meaningful. However, certain specific liberties such as freedom of speech, freedom of worship, rights of association, and of personal and sexual relations, do require special protection against governmental interference. This is not because these preferred liberties have some special substantive or inherent value (as most rights philosophers hold), but because of a kind of procedural impediment that these preferred liberties might face. The impediment is that if those liberties were left to a utilitarian calculation, that is, an unrestricted calculation of the general interest, the balance would be tipped in favor of restrictions. . . . Dworkin says that if a vote were truly utilitarian, then all voters would desire the liberties for themselves, and the liberties would be protected under a utilitarian calculation. However, a vote on these liberties would not be truly utilitarian nor would it afford equal concern about and respect for liberties solely by reflecting personal wants or satisfactions of individuals and affording equal concerns to others . . . because [of] external preferences, such as prejudice and discrimination against other individuals deriving from the failure to generally treat other persons as equals . . . These external preferences would corrupt utilitarianism by causing the individual to vote against assigning liberties to others. Accordingly, the liberties that must be protected against such external preferences must be given a preferred status. By doing so, society can protect the fundamental right of citizens to equal concern and respect because it prohibits \"decisions that seem, antecedently, likely to have been reached by virtue of the external components of the preferences democracy reveals.\" (The Philosophic Foundations of Human Rights, Jerome Shestack, Human Rights Quarterly 20.2: 201-234) Con\\'s first point deals with liberty of contract. His argument basically boils down to the \"Contract? I never signed a contract!\" shtick, and you shouldn\\'t buy it for a number of reasons. First, the principle that liberty is inviolable overrides consent--in other words, rights cannot be subjected to a vote, for the simple reason that if they can be revoked by a simple majority vote, they aren\\'t really rights. Second, consent of the governed is not valuable as an end, but a means to an end. Suppose a woman opposes restrictions on abortion until fetal viability, but the state they reside in institutes waiting periods, requires consent of parents/the court, etc. They did not consent to those restrictions being placed upon people. Even if she are in the government itself, it cannot be said that the women \"consented\" to such restrictions. The sense of consent that Con uses is this broad sense, in which every person must consent to every single law they live under and every condition that would potentially infringe on their freedom, and it is a total fantasy--there is zero possibility of ever achieving broad consent like that. Even in the state of nature, the fantasy land where everyone voluntarily consents to contracts, Con cannot pretend that people \"consent\" to starvation, for instance. If we accept that consent of the governed is thus not a right, then we have destroyed our own framework that we agreed to. The only solution is to change the way we view our terms. If I have an apple, for instance, and a thief takes it without my permission, what is the crime? The crime in itself cannot be my lack of consent; the crime is the theft of the apple, and the lack of consent is why it is a crime. However, say a random stranger, in an act of kindness, slips $20 into my coat. I did not consent to that, but was any crime committed? After all, I did not consent to this action performed on me. Consent of the governed is a means to the end of the protection of liberty--it is not an end in itself. It does not matter that Americans today did not sign the Constitution. If one were to sign a regular contract, ignorant of some of the provisions, and it turns out that those provisions are actually favorable to the ignorant person, there is no injustice. What grants the Constitution legitimacy is not consent; it is its protection of the rights of the people. As Dworkin notes, \" . . . a collective decision to impose a duty not to kill and to threaten a serious sanction for any violation is in itself an insult to the dignity of subjects. On the contrary, your dignity as an equal citizen requires that government protect you in this way. It is not demeaning . . . to accept that a majority of your fellow citizens has the right to fix traffic rules and enforce the rules they fix, provided that the rules . . . are not wicked or desperately foolish\" (Dworkin 367). With this in mind, we must devise a different analysis from what Con has suggested. The measure of any governmental system is not whether it is completely consensual, but whether it is just, and by extension, whether it protects individual liberties. Con\\'s argument is wholly based on contract language, which I have debunked, but his alternatives seem to be meaningless when it comes to protecting liberty--destroying and replacing Constitutions in itself carries no inherent procedural benefit. A Living Constitution does. As Dworkin noted, democratic utilitarian calculations and votes on rights are inherently unjust because of discrimination against others, so the rights cannot be put to a vote. They must be protected by an independent institution--the Supreme Court. Rehashing constitutions every few years or abolishing the constitution is merely a more complicated form of the tyranny of the majority. Extend Obergefell v. Hodges as an example of protection of rights thanks to the Living Constitution. Extend judicial review as another example. Since Con asked me to justify why a living constitution would be superior to a new constitution in Rome, I\\'ll respond to that. The reason is as simple as that a new constitution was impossible to create. As I said last round, there was \"enduring conflict between two camps--the populares and the optimates--with the former relying on popular support to pass reforms and the latter relying on senatorial support to promote stability (153). The clear issue is that there was a dichotomy between the two, when there shouldn\\'t have been a dichotomy. Choosing between terrible law and lawless reform is not a choice. The populares largely gave up on the law altogether, and the optimates failed miserably in their attempts to restore the Republic.\" Had new constitutions been made, they would have inevitably slanted toward the more-numerous populares, who were the epitome of majoritarian, as evidenced by the many mobs that they formed to kill political leaders and kick people out of the Senate and all sorts of other fun things (sarcasm). If I haven\\'t shown that a LC would be better, I\\'ve at least shown that creating a new Constitution or leaving the dead one would have been a lot worse.']\n",

Voters should also take into account the logic and reasoning behind each of our arguments, our gift of persuasion and articulation, and the overall presentation of our ideas to support our claim. With that being said, I would like to point out that not only have I refuted each and every one of my opponents main points, but also provided a sufficient and succesful rebuttal to actually prove him wrong, or at least put a spin on his point to show that in fact his argument really does support the notion that basketball is in fact better than basbeall. Thus in my conclusion I will provide a re-cap of these examples, as well as include a brief summation of the additional points that I have made to which my opponent failed to prove me wrong.

My challenger attempted to argue that a slower paced sport is preferable over a fast paced game; not only do I disagree (as it is, afterall, a matter of opinion) but I trumped his argument by reminding him that with basketball you have more leeway in determining the tempo of the game, whereas with baseball there\\'s really not much you can do to speed up each individual play Win: Me 3. My opponent agreed that baseball and basketball are both equally easy to learn and accessible to play. However I then won this argument by pointing out the fact that baseball players have to invest in gloves or mitts, while basketball players only have to utilize the two \"hoops\" and one (less easy to lose) ball. Win: Me 4. Pro contends that baseball is a better sport than basketball because it provides less room for injury. On the other hand, I argue that the athleticism necessary to play basketball provides for better, more talented and well-rounded athletes to play the game. Plus, basketball is a greater source of exercise than baseball on all levels. Win: Me, Me 5. It was a good idea to contest that a baseball\\'s playing field is better than a basketball court due to the fact that baseball is played outdoors and typically in fair weather. However my argument is that not everyone enjoys being outdoors - especially people with allergies; the cancellation of baseball games due to weather conditions can be disappointing, dissatisfying and annoying to players, fans and those that head particular organizations; basketball can in fact be played indoors and outdoors whereas baseball cannot effectively be played indoors Win: Me, Me, Me 6. My opponent claims that baseball has the most interesting increase and decrease of stats (thus providing for a more exciting Fantasy team experience), as well as the most compelling trades in professional sports. My argument is that the topic of debate is baseball vs. basketball, not Fantasy Baseball vs. Fantasy Basketball. Also, while baseball may have interesting trades going on, basketball definitely has superior free agent makets, so. Win: Me, if anything 7. My opponent discussed the adrenaline rush received from baseball; I argued that beating the the time clock as opposed to playing the set number of innings provide for a greater rush. Win: Me 8. Pro mentioned that more people can play baseball than basketball at a time, because there are 9 people on a team as opposed to 5. However I argued that basketball includes the consistent rotation of players, making it probable that 9 or more players can and will participate during the duration of an entire basketball game. Win: Me, if anything 10. My challenger states that baseball and softball are not sexist. I feel like softball being considered a \"sissy version\" of baseball has a mental impact on people\\'s assumption of the sport, especially young kids (girls). Also, the fact that there is a WNBA is a plus for women\\'s involvement in professional sports. Win: Me 11. As far as strategy goes, my opponent successfully argued against my point that there is more implmentation of strategic planning in basketball than in baseball. However, he did not make an argument for baseball having MORE implementation than basketball, so this point results in a tie. Win: Tie 12. My challenger suggests that a sport bing more lucrative does not necessarily make it better, per se, and I agree. However to come people it DOES make it better... or more enjoyable... so. The win goes to me, but I\\'ll consider it a tie. Win: Tie 13. Pro attempted to refute the fact that basketball requires athletes to play a more equal and engaging part of both offense and defense by stating that you never know which part of the field the ball will be set to play. Or something. And while that is true, it still does not make it less true or more okay that basketball requires more skill and whatnot. Win: Me? 14. My opponent stated that basketball discriminates against shorter or smaller people. I argue that many people have overcome that stereotype and give hope to young people who would also like to overcome adversity for a sport that they love. Win: Me? I believe there were even more arguments in which I have out-debated Pro, however, I will conclude for now due to the fact that my challenger has not beat me on one single point throughout this entire debate. So while I do admit that this debate was (the most challeneing, actually) extremely interesting and well-rounded, and that my opponent gave me a decent run for my money, I would also like to point out that I clearly \"won\" on every single point, and therefore deserve the win. I not only successfully argued against all of my opponent\\'s claims, but also made many of my own that he could not refute. My points were all well though out, carefully constructed, and outnumber my challenger\\'s. In addition they were all pretty clever... heh... so happy reading, and vote Con! Thanks :)', 'Almost ALL arguments made on either of our parts are going to be a matter of opinion due to the nature of the debate topic at hand. It is our job to refine our points and exemplify that our arguments are stronger than our respective opponent\\'s; the better competitor will (hopefully) win the most votes. With that said, I will begin by again refuting your argument that baseball is a better sport because of its slower pace laid-back nature. I disagree, sighting the fact that sports in general became popular and celebrated during the time of the Ancient Greeks, in an era where men participated in the first Olympic games and attempted to display superiroity in various aspects of athleticism. Using their bodies, men came to compete and win against their opponents by methods of paramount strength, agility, speed, talent, wit, etc. Generally, when people are able to move and think at a faster pace, it is deemed a more challenging feat. An example is a timed game of chess; people who perform at top-speed or play chess with a time clock are said to be better chess players. Thus a sport that requires a more fast paced tempo can arguably be considered more challenging when using the logic that I have put forth. More challenging means consistent room for improvement, and a better way to exemplify talent and superiority in various areas practically synonomous with sports (i.e. strength and stamina). Also, not every game of basketball has to be fast paced. There are many teams, in fact, that are actually known to both prefer and excel during a more \"laid back\" game of basketball. However, the benefit of basketball over baseball is that one can always choose to either increase or decrease the level of intensity (tempo) of a game, whereas baseball is pretty consistent with its timing and pace. In regard to a time clock vs. set number of innings required for a game, my point was not to argue that a timeclock is of greater value than a set number of innings or plays, but rather to provide an example of why having to \"beat the clock\" provides a greater adrenaline rush. Like I said, you can\\'t really do much to change the tempo of a baseball game, whereas with basketball you can say, \"Ok - there\\'s only a little time left - we have to pick up the pace!\" The game gets more exciting that way for both the players (who have to think on their feet and perform), and the fans who watch in anticipation to see if their team can overcome the pressure, and prevail by outsmarting and outplaying their opponents. I can also provide a more than sufficient rebuttal to your claim that it\\'s beneficial for everyone on the team to have equal at-bats, whereas basketball consists of various players taking different amounts of shots. My main point is that the concept of teamwork doesn\\'t have to do with individual performances being put together to create one result, but rather a collaborative effort to virtually ignore individual success, and focus instead on the achievements of the TEAM as a whole. In other words, people on basketball teams aren\\'t *supposed* to take the same number of shots. The beauty of it is that each position is equally important and consists of different \"tasks\" and responsibilities. For instance, I would expect a Shooting Guard or a Forward to take more shots than a Point Guard. Reason being that the PG\\'s \"job\" isn\\'t to make baskets, per se, but rather to find an open teammate to pass the ball to in order to complete the play and make the shot. A PG\\'s role is different than a Center\\'s job -- that\\'s the beauty of it. It\\'s different positions consisting of different players working together towards a common goal. I love it. I would also like to argue your stance that baseball encourages more kids to play than basketball does. First of all, basketball players do not usually play for the duration of the entire game. In fact, it is common to see a frequent rotation of players going in and out of the game, thus making it not only possible but actually probable that 9 or more kids can participate on a basketball team. Additionally, since you brought up a sport\\'s accessibility to children, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a cheaper and easier sport to play than baseball. This is because someone would have to buy a glove or mitt to play baseball, whereas you only need 3 pieces of equipment (two \"hoops\" and a ball) to play b-ball. ALSO, due to the smaller ball and overall nature of the game, a baseball is easier to lose than a basketball, thus making basketball the better bet for kids who worry about losing equipment. Again I argue the superiority of basketball to baseball due to its more demanding physical attributes to play the game. I believe that sports were designed to exhibit superior athleticism, and you clearly most be in better physical shape and have more refined skills to play basketball over baseball. Plus, a lot of people play sports as an alternative to straight-up exercise, and basketball provides a MUCH greater work out than baseball, obviously. My opponent is correct in stating that there are neither no co-ed baseball or basketball teams; however, there is at least an official professional level agency for women\\'s basketball, whereas baseball remains off-limits to women once they reach a professional level of their careers. Thus many girls choose to participate in basketball over baseball, because they know they have a better chance of making a living as an athlete if they chose one route over the other. And finally, your argument that it\\'s \"nicer\" to enjoy a sport in sunny weather rather than indoors is lacking, to say the least. First of all, just because you enjoy being outdoors does not mean that everybody else does. What about the millions of people who have allergies and prefer being in a place where they don\\'t have to worry about the downsides to their condition? Second, the cancellation of games due to weather conditions can be both disappointing and a huge inconvenience. This goes for both the players, the fans, and the organizations that run the games. Third, the weather outside - for instance the variation of hot and cold - has an impact on a player and their ability to perform. In an indoors arena, the level of playing field is typically very consistent, and therefore does not deter an athlete from performing at their best. Lastly on this point, you forgot that basketball doesn\\'t HAVE to be played indoors -- there are many, many games and events that actually support and/or mandate that basketball be played outside, where players and fans can enjoy all of the \"sunny weather\" that you promoted in regards to the playing field of baseball. Thus where you can and cannot play a sport and when definitely gives basketball the advantage over baseball. To wrap up this around, I would also like to include several key points, including: A) Basketball allows for more strategy implementation B)Regarding professional sports, the average basketball player earns $5 million; the average baseball player earns $2 million C) Basketball requires more skill because a player must always play both the positions of offense and defense during the duration of a game. With baseball, a player can go an entire game (or even season!) without ever having to be on the defensive end of a play. With basketball, all players are resonsible for equal talent and performance on both ends of offense vs. defense; even if they fail in stealing or rebounding a ball, they still must guard their respective assignment or zone to the best of their ability to prevent their opponent from scoring D) Basketball promotes self-esteem and the notion to try and never give up. This is because small players such Muggsy Bogues stood at just 5\\'3\" tall and weighed a mere 136 lbs, and still made it to the NBA as one of the franchise\\'s most successful players << No more characters :P', 'Basketball is the more popular sport world-wide in comparison to baseball, with basketball being ranked as the 2nd most popular with 400+ million participants, and baseball being ranked 7th with 60+ million participants. Because both sports are played in the Olympics, countries all over the world have had exposure to both games, and by the amount of participants that engage in each we can assume that more people are fans of basketball as opposed to baseball. However I will not assume that more participants worldwide = a better sport. Well, maybe. But not necessarily. Thus I will continue on to state that a lot of basketball\\'s assets, in my opinion, you recognized as flaws. For instance I feel that the fast pace of basketball in opposition with baseball is one of the many things that make it a more exciting game to both watch and play. Each \\'play\\' in baseball can be dragged out and even seem monotonous after awhile (foul ball after foul ball after pitch after pitch after pitch with many seconds and pointless minutes in between). However basketball keeps both the athletes and viewers on their toes, and more plays mean more opportunities for the tone and pace of the game to shift. This gives the opposing team a better chance of coming back to regain the lead, thus making it a more exciting and fun game to engage in or spectate. Plus, having a time limit for a game increases the intensity and adrenaline much more than the rush you speak of in your argument for baseball giving you that same feeling. Another aspect of your argument that I disagree with is when you claim that individual responsibility is *benefit* of baseball. Instead I argue that mistakes are more forgivable in basketball, and thus more emphasis is placed on cooperation and teamwork rather than showing off or stressing over the fact that your performance can either make or break the team\\'s record. How often does a baseball player get blamed when he strikes out in the bottom of the 9th and therefore ends his team\\'s chance of winning the game? However in a game of basketball, even if someone misses the winning shot in the 4th quarter, there were many more shots taken in the game of basketball than at-bats in a game of baseball, making it more apparent that a team\\'s win or loss is not thanks in particular to one individual, but rather the team as a collective unit working together effectively and scoring points. I would also like to take this opportunity to disagree that baseball is a cheaper and easier alternative to basketball. This is because kids can make \"baskets\" out of anything just as you can turn any instrument into a \"bat\" of sorts. For instance, you can use a trash can, basket or even drawn-on square box to serve as a \"hoop\" and just about any ball that bounces as a ball. You can even play by yourself if you had to... Furthermore, I would like to elaborate and correct you on your argument that baseball is a safer game than basketball to play. While it\\'s true that you will probably sustain more injuries in a game of basketball than a game of baseball, I would like to point out that basketball is in fact a more physical game, and with that intense level of athleticism being demonstrated you are bound to come across both pros and cons in terms of rewards and potential risks. For example, you may be more likely to strain a muscle while playing basketball; however, basketball is a sport that requires more physical activity and stamina. Thus the benefit to this \"risk\" is the fact that basketball keeps you in much better shape than baseball does. This becomes apparent when you take a look at the physical fitness of basketball players vs. the physical health of baseball players. Basketball players have to spend long periods of time running back and forth, and constantly moving various parts of their body at the same time. It provides a great cardio work out, and keeps the muscles flexible, loose and strong. Due to the easy-going and less strenuous nature of the game, baseball players can get away with being less agile and less healthy individuals than basketball players. Thanks to an organization like the WNBA, basketball has become a more popular sport due to its mass appeal geared for and towards women. Instead of creating an \"inferior\" sport like softball (many people feel like it\\'s a sissy version of baseball), women are actually encouraged to participate in a sport like basketball, and can now even go Pro. Additionally, college basketball programs are FAR more successful than their baseball and softball programs (times ten). In response to a ball park being an ideal place to hold a sporting event, I disagree based on the reasoning that you can play basketball in any type of weather condition during any particular season. Whereas a baseball game can be rained out, or ended early on account of drizzle or snow fall, basketball is played indoors and is therefore more convenient/consistent. You mentioned that baseball was relatively easy to learn; I\\'ll argue that basketball has rules and goals that are just as simple. At the same time, a certain amount of planning and strategy (not to mention practice, training, strengthening and conditioning) goes into basketball While you contend that baseball has the most compelling trade aspects in any realm of professional sports, I\\'d like to point out, \"The Larry Bird rule that gives NBA teams the right to match deals in order to keep their stars gives basketball the advantage\" -- Baseball America. With that, I think I\\'ll go to bed for now. I feel like I have sufficiently responded to each and every one of your points, and in turn made some arguments of equivocal or greater value to prove that basketball is in fact the superior of the two sports. I now leave it up to you to respond, and in my next argument I will be glad to refute any of your additional points as well as provide some more of my own for a final rebuttal in the third round. Thank you and good night :)']\n",
            "[\"Again it becomes apparent that the differentiation of the two games only lead to a matter of opinion. .. While I think a slower paced game is more enjoyable, you have argued that the opposite can be said of other people. And since more people do enjoy basketball over baseball according to statistics, I suppose you do have a good point. However I ask that voters vote not based on the number of reasons that one challenger provides the other, but rather the validity of our points, and our ability of one opponent to outtalk the other and provide for a more convincing argument. On a final note I would like to state for the record that I do believe my points have more relevance and certainty than my opponents, and I would like to take this final opportunity to argue some of her last points. Here we go. .. A. Basketball does NOT in fact allow for more strategy implementation. There is an equal or more amount of strategy that goes into baseball. This is because a batter can choose a number of routes that he wants to go, for instance, attempting to hit the ball to a particular side of the field, bunting over swinging, intentionally being hit by a pitch, intentionally walking or striking out, etc. A player can also choose to steal bases, go for a double play over a single play, attempt to run home after a catch is made in the outfield, and more. A pitcher has a variety of pitching options to choose from, etc. And managers and coaches alike have to use their smarts to come up with the best route to receive the best result, so don't give me any of that crap that basketball rquires the most strategy or plays because that is simply not true. B. Basketball might be more lucrative than baseball, so what. That doesn't make it better. C. This much is true, basketball players do definitely have a chance to play more defense than baseball players. However baseball players still always have to be on their toes just in case a play comes to them. The suspense is that you never know where the ball is going to be in play.\", 'Based on you turning my position of basketball\\'s flaws being assets, I think it\\'s fair to assume that it is simply a matter of differing opinions and therefore neither can be regarded as fact. So for instance, I say that baseball\\'s slower paced tempo of the game is of better value than the upbeat pace of basketball, because it provides for a more relaxing sport to watch and laid back sport to play. You get to compete athletically without too much exhaustion which can and does make the game more enjoyable for certain people. To refute your point that basketball is greater than baseball because there is a \"time limit\" per se, my argument is that there is also some kind of limit on baseball as there are a set number of innings (unless the game goes into extra innings, the way basketball can go into overtime). To argue that basketball is more of a team sport because there is less individual responsibility, I also say nay... I feel as though each individual performance collectively adds to the team as a whole; everyone has equal amount of at-bats to make things happen, whereas in basketball not everyone takes the same amount of shots. I agree that both baseball and basketball are of the same accessibility to play- touche. However on that note I would like to point out that baseball encourages more kids to play, be involved and participate in a team sport because each team requires 9 players instead of just 5. Thus more kids can play in the game without having a lot of people \"sit out\" or whatever. I also think that the lesser \"athleticism\" you need to play baseball is actually a good thing. People who want to have the option to train their bodies, work hard, stay in shape, etc which will undoubtedly improve their performance in the game. But those who want to remain physically unfit also have the option to play (ie: a position like 1B where there is little amount of running or moving required). Softball is not that popular, but just as there are no co-ed basketball teams, there are no co-ed baseball teams; that doesn\\'t mean that baseball discriminates against women. And the less popularity of a sport doesn\\'t make it less awesome, you\\'re right. For example most people would argue that soccer or \"football\" is the best sport, but if you look at the numbers in this country, soccer doesn\\'t even come close to being considered the favorite or most widely played. I personally enjoy the fact that baseball has to be played in nice weather. It provides a nice atmosphere for players and fans alike, plus it gets people outside and enjoying the sunshine for a change. And that\\'s about it for now.', 'Although both baseball and basketball are both popular team sports, there are many advantages that baseball has over basketball making it the better of the two games. For instance, while both sports promote teamwork and a collective effort by all athletes on their respective teams, baseball allows for a greater aspect of personal responsibility. Each member of the team has the opportunity to literally \"go to bat\" for their team and make an impact on their teams standing and the entire game. Also, teamwork is necessary to complete many plays such as the double play, triple play, 2B or SS cut off on a throw to home plate, or even to get a guy out at 1B. But at the same time, each player has to do their part in order to complte the play, thus putting a certain amount of pressure on the player and creating a good kind of stress or adrenaline rush that makes the game more exciting and fun for both the athlete and the audience. The slower paced game of baseball is one of the main reasons why it remains such a popular sport and \"America\\'s favorite past time\" ... because you can sit back, relax, have a beer, and enjoy the game without always having to be so riled up all the time. Though baseball definitely has its exciting moments, and the thrill of your favorite player hitting a home run or grand slam never gets old, its definitely a more chill game that provides for a different type of viewing experience. For people (kids) who want to play baseball at home, but don\\'t have a lot of money for equipment, they\\'ll be happy to know that you can make a bat of just about anything... a stick (stickball), a paddle, a raquet, etc. And just about any type of ball... wiffle ball, hand ball, tennis ball, etc. can be used for a baseball. You can make bases out of just about anything too, even draw them on. And gloves may or may not be necessary depending on the type of ball and \"bat\" that is being used. But my point is that it is not a terribly expensive game to play. The rules of baseball are pretty easy to learn, making it easy to grasp and a fun time for both beginners and champions alike. Baseball is one of the safest sports you can play; there is little wear and tear on an athlete\\'s body (that\\'s why baseball players have a longer career that athletes involved with other sports) and there is a lesser chance of injury than say with basketball which is known to give its players knee problems, ankle injuries, and more. Professional baseball is played in a ball park, which is a traditional gathering spot for friends and family to meet up and have an infamous ballpark frank, or spend the day together taking in a good game. Professional baseball also has the most compelling trades and interesting increase and decrease of stats, also making it the most fun Fantasy pro sport game. Baseball has been around longer in the United States than basketball, and it has earned the title of our National Pastime because so many Americans are fans. It is a fun game on any competitive level, and the better of the two sports by far. Your turn!']\n",
            "['Your last comment about redundancy is an excellent description of this debate. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. \"punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child.\" This is statement is correct if saying it from the viewpoint it is looked through, a human society viewpoint, civilization and acts of human being towards other human beings. It is simply not correct if viewed through the awesome sinless, perfect authority of God\\'s Just and Holy Sovereignty. \"examples of where god commits genocide for the sins of the adult population.\" <------The bibles position is that all have fallen short, and all are sinful that \"deserve\" hell but (I know, I know) were given something they didn\\'t deserve, that is, Jesus Christ. ================== [2.] 100% of people who are educated on the Hebrew and Greek translations will all shoot you down on this. Job is THE perfect example of God\\'s ultimate authority in the old testament scriptures because they understand what the original writer was in fact portraying, not what the reader thought it was portraying. To interject your own opinion about what was happening to Job and ignore the person that was experiencing it, not to mention, actually talking to God, heck... to believe that the events were not false and that Jobs knowledge (because that\\'s what the bible says it is) is false is a fallacy in it\\'s own merit. I\\'m sorry I\\'m breaking my rule: \"Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals...\" <---- Steals? The Bible states that all the wealth people own already belongs to God, so God cannot steal what has always been his. ...all his wealth. Then proceeds to hurt Job personally with illness. All this time Job is begging for an answer,...\" <------ Not once did Job ever beg or even ask for an answer... his mistake (not sin) was challenging God to dare accuse himself of sinning(and dare use that as an explanation for his actions against Job), because Job KNEW he was not guilty of sinning. \"...asking what he did wrong, what he did to deserve this(talking to his friends).\" <---- I\\'d hate to say it but this is simply not in the biblical story. It was Job\\'s friends who accused him of sinning, and it was Job who openly challenged God to prove that sin was a cause of these events, because again Job KNEW this was not the case. \"Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN...\" <----- You have this 100% backwards, it was Satan who started this all because he wanted to wager a bet that Job would curse God. \"...(you know, the most evil entity ever). At the end, God shows up and instead of explaining to Job why all this has happened to him, he goes on a rhetorical speech asking him \"where you there when the earth was born?\" <---- Again, the mother of all explanation being ignored(Sorry to say it like that, really I\\'m a nice guy!), God can do anything is pleases... even Job knew this... and was terrified because of it! Job 23:13 - \"But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases... 15 Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; When I consider, I am terrified of Him. ================ [3.] \"How is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God?\" 1. I am not obligating god. I am merely stating that by human standards, what god did and the system he created was/is not fair. 2. \"Again, not everyone was \"constantly sinning\". The bible states that everyone constantly sins... 3. \"Nor do we have any proof that God\\'s law was known to them.\" There is also no proof that Abraham became righteous as a result from God speaking to him, on the contrary, it simply said that Abram obeyed God\\'s command to start his Journey, nothing more. \"(btw: Romans-1 says this for the believers in the sense that \"god was all around them\" in the argument for his existence. Not his Law.).\" <----- I agreed when I put it there and even now! Hence \"So people are without excuse.\" I realize you are logical person... all of the \"no proof\" arguments are canceled out because of the basic logical standpoint that \"the absence of proof does not prove anything\". \"The point is that you are assuming that these people had full knowledge of their actions\"<------- Not at all, I did note that Numbers and Leviticus accounts for unintentional sins and even unknown sins! Honestly, do you know anyone, like in Lot\\'s case that wanted to rape other men by breaking down Lot\\'s door, and didn\\'t know it was wrong? Even aborigines know to respect a man\\'s home! 4. Unintentional Sin is again, for the believers of the religion. Those who could not know of the religion could not know of the concept of Sin, be it unintentional or otherwise. <---- you are right with the word \"sin\" but are wrong with the action of sin. This is ultimately shot down with Romans 2 that says: \"\"13for it is not the hearers of the Law who are just before God, but the doers of the Law will be justified. 14For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, 15in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them,\"\" [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. \"[NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others.\" <----because I was busy making that case that this is not true...I am being redundant now, guilty! \"Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human? That\\'s taking it a bit too far.\" <----Now I know your not reading your bible... Jesus took it that far by starting this parable with \"For the kingdom of heaven is like...\" C: God\\'s \"right\" MkII \"No. Creation of something does not imply ownership, especially when free-will and sentience are concerned.\" <------ You mean the free-will and sentience that... God created...? Also implying that God is above morality is implying the appeal to authority fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org...... Please, do not argue that because God is perfect, the system must be perfect. That is beneath you.\" <--- First off, I genuinely accept that compliment! That made me feel special coming from someone yourself. And I would never dare to resort to such childish tactics that unstable Christians resort to[yes I said that]. I must add though... to be fair... that the bible...which is true for this debate... does say \"As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.\" - Psalms 18:30. I didn\\'t argue that... technically the bible did that one! Thanks again!', 'Before I begin, I would like to say how much I admire your constant stable minded attitude toward responding. A true logical mind indeed you are... something I aspire to attain to perfection if that were possible. I do accept the note of not correcting your responses but just responding to them. I do have to admit that I did not attack or even touch the topic of God dealing with Sodom and Gomorrah, and unfortunately must decline the opportunity again because, like others, this \"problem\" can automatically be answered by addressing underlying issues. One of these underlying issues that was accidentally assumed, and not picked up by myself in the opening of this debate, was \"a baby\\'s innocence\". 1.\"A baby\\'s innocence\" I am almost afraid that if this point is not fairly discussed and unskewed, then this debate will reflect the same direction. I must bring this debate back to the rule of \"for the sake of this argument the Bible is true.\" That means that for the sake of this debate, even cute, innocent looking, tiny, can\\'t-make-proper-decisions-for-themselves babies are in fact just as sinful as us adults who can and do sin on purpose. \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin my mother conceived me.\" - Psalms 51:5. \"The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth. They have venom like the venom of a serpent; like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, or a skillful caster of spells. O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord\" - Psalms 58:3-6 2. \"The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised.\" (Job 1:21) If there is anyone in the Bible that has the right to complain about God being immoral, it is Job! He had his own children taken away amongst other horrible things, and yet he states that the Lord has the right to do so hence, him praising God after. I am compelled to reinstate that this is not Jobs opinion, but KNOWLEDGE of the Lord. 3. The idea that \"God NOT giving people a second chance is not fair.\" I formed this educated assumption by \"P1\" which says \"God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them.\" To say that God didn\\'t give them a second chance is to automatically admit they did something that is deserving of some sort of punishment. Plain and simply put I will answer this in the form of a question...how is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God? And just in case this turns into a \"well, they didn\\'t know they were sinning against God\" issue... Romans 1 says \"For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness, 19 because what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes \" his eternal power and divine nature \" have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse.\" Levitus and Numbers, as you know, even goes on to talk about even \\'unintentional sin\\' or unknown sin must also be offered a sacrifice. 4. God\\'s right to choose. \"P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell.\" This is simply God\\'s right to choose, in this case, he chose to keep a promise made to Abraham, because God is faithful in his promises. Let me fairly remind you that he almost broke this promise as my previous argument shows [which is another debate in it\\'s own]. Matthew 20:1-16: 9 \"The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. 10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. 11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. 12 \"These who were hired last worked only one hour,\" they said, \"and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\" 13 \"But he answered one of them, \"I am not being unfair to you, friend. Didn\"t you agree to work for a denarius? 14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. 15 Don\"t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\" C: One of the most common mistakes that happen when humans question God\\'s moral compass is to imply that God is not the creator of the morals. God alone has a right reserved to take away anything and everything according to the bible. Unlike us, he created everything and according to the bible IS everything. God also, unlike us, is not only sinless but void of sin. These are major contributors, when understood, to God\\'s \"seemingly immoral, genocidal, murderous\" ways.', 'As a preface to anyone who is viewing this debate: 1. Whether you are Christian or Non-Christian, please view the facts as they are presented as unbiased as possible... otherwise the voting could never truly reflect the facts \\'not opinions\\' presented as they are for THIS debate. I thank the Pro for providing the only ground work for this type of debate... and something that even you the reading must agree to for the sake of voting properly. 2. \"Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true.\" <--- As per the Pro. 3. Also reader, please note that he does use the term \\'true\\' and not \\'real\\'. So you must accept, for the purposes of this debate that EVERYTHING the Bible says is \\'TRUE\\' and not false. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. First Rebuttal: 1. \"The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity.\" -Surprisingly this was actually my first statement that I was locked into and I realized that there is actually flaw to this statement. The flaw is the word humanity! The definition that is. You see if I were to take your rules seriously about this debate than this statement is done out of ignorance. I could literally use basic math to rephrase the sentence to see it a little more clearly by using your given definition of sin. \"The system in the bible for [disobeying God]and it\\'s punishment[of going to hell], is not fair in regards to humanity.\" For you to fully understand the Bibles arguments that God is in fact being \"fair\", you must understand God\\'s attributes. There are many, but the main one is God is Holy. Many Christians surprisingly don\\'t even know what this means! The bible says God is \"Holy, holy, holy\" (Revelation 4:8), it\\'s saying that He is separated, separated, separated (Old Hebrew language would repeat something that is important rather than modern English using BOLD or exclamations) which is referring to God being so very separated from the world, people, evil and sin that it is not even funny. Again not by choice, it\\'s just what he is. So when Adam and Eve disobeyed God\\'s commandment of not eating from the tree of good and evil, they chose to disobey God\\'s commandment and because they had knowledge like God ABOUT sin, unlike God, they had freewill to act upon that knowledge. And again God is Holy and sin has no part in God or his actions whatsoever, God simply has knowledge of it just like Satan told Eve. The end result is a disobedience woman and man who passing their \"corruption\" to their descendants \"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.\" -1 Corinthians 15:50 THEN ENTERS MY NICE FLOW INTO YOUR FIRST ARGUMENT... 2. \"Sins of our Fathers\" \"Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.\" Psalms 51:5 - To be absolutely clear, their is nothing in the bible that says God has ever or will ever give a death sentence to a baby whose (according to your example) parents are terrible role models when it comes to following God. \"I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of THOSE WHO HATE ME, but showing lovingkindness to thousands, to those WHO LOVE ME AND KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS.\" Without going into a lot of detail, there is nowhere here that says God will kill or send to hell the sons of sinful parents. You\\'d have to reach petty far to get it there. Deuteronomy 24:16 says, \"Fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall sons be put to death for their fathers; everyone shall be put to death for his own sin.\" Lastly your remark about us being \"moral\" is also ignorance because according to the rules the Bible is true, so if I were to take that and rephrase your remark it would read... \"We as [Sinful, disobedient people] do not in good moral conscience blame the [psalms 51:5] for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give [psalms 51:5] death sentences because the father murdered.\" <---- How can immoral sinful people have a good moral conscious? I\\'m just trying to follow your Rule about the Bible being true! \"And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity.\" <------ I agree and God does too! 3. Those \"undeserving\" of Hell. -For the sake of readers getting bored I will correct some Biblical areas as per your rule, as to bring about a quick non-biased approach from the reader: \"In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not [ask for] forgiveness goes to Hell.\" \"This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven.\" Not so my friend according to the Bible which is true for the sake of this debate \"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.\" 1 Corinthians 10:4 \"P1:God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood [Noah is called a Preacher of Righteousness - 2 Peter 2:5], Sodom and Gomorrah [Genesis 18:16-33 says that Abraham pleaded for the safety of Sodom]\"the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all [were killed] thanks to God\\'s actions [I don\\'t get this, so if an executioner, in your words \"morally\" executes a killer then the executioner is wrong?]. \"It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture.\" <-----This is actually very surprisingly biblical. Psalm 115:3 says \"But our God is in the heavens; He does whatever He pleases.\" and 1 Samuel 2:6 says \"The LORD kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.\" \"P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system.\" <---- I just have to ask, who are these so called \"good\" people your are referring to specifically? \"P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. <---- This is simply not founded in any scripture although Israel is God\\'s chosen people God even wanted to wipe out Israel at one point [Numbers 14:11-19]. \"According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity.\"<----please refer to previous C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents DOES IN FACT present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment. I hope I\\'ve been fair in my rebuttal.']\n",
            "['Ah. I did not intend to pull a \"fast one\" on you, but it\\'s hard to phrase the \"rules\" correctly in the start. 1. A baby\\'s innocence. -Now first off I was not making the argument that a child is not sinful from birth, or that bible does not state so. What I was saying is that the punishment for sin(i.e. murder, hell), is something that should not be applied to a child. -This cuts back to the \"sins of our father\" point. We are all paying for the sins of Adam in general, but there are examples of where god commits genocide for the sins of the adult population. ================== [2.] Oh boy. Yeah Job is one of the few examples I would never, EVER use in reference to his \"knowledge\" of the Lord or his morality. Simple summary: God kills Job\\'s family, livestock, and steals all his wealth. Then proceeds to hurt Job personally with illness. All this time Job is begging for an answer, asking what he did wrong, what he did to deserve this(talking to his friends). Meanwhile God started all this because of a bet with SATAN(you know, the most evil entity ever). At the end, God shows up and instead of explaining to Job why all this has happened to him, he goes on a rhetorical speech asking him \"where you there when the earth was born?\" -Then God proceeds to replace that which Job had lost, but not in originality. God replaces everything by quantity. [The story of Job shows entirely that God punishes unfairly and to those undeserving.] God effectively murdered innocent people to prove a point to Satan. That\\'s probably the worse example you could have given for your argument. ================ [3.] \"How is it fair to obligate God [the author of life itself] to give a second chance when punishment is deserved for constant sin against God?\" 1. I am not obligating god. I am merely stating that by human standards, what god did and the system he created was/is not fair. 2. Again, not everyone was \"constantly sinning\". We have no proof that all of mankind(even the children) were committing outrageous acts against God for the story of Noah, or that the slave/Egyptian children sinned so heavily, or that any of these acts of complete genocide were Justified. This is another problem with the system and it\\'s fairness, God does not state what sin or what acts lead to the genocide of these people. 3. Nor do we have any proof that God\\'s law was known to them. (btw: Romans-1 says this for the believers in the sense that \"god was all around them\" in the argument for his existence. Not his Law.). -No proof that God came to them as he did Moses. -No proof that God\\'s law is available to everyone in a way they can comprehend it. -No proof that Jesus has shown himself to everyone either.(for the argument of after). The point is that you are assuming that these people had full knowledge of their actions, the consequences, and the system God presented. The bible never mentions this, nor does reality support it. Even now you can easily prove that God does not present his system to everyone. [Note]: I get that we are arguing with the bible = true rule,but when it aligns with modern reality I think this has relevance. 4. Unintentional Sin is again, for the believers of the religion. Those who could not know of the religion could not know of the concept of Sin, be it unintentional or otherwise. ============= [4.] God\\'s \"right\" to choose. [NOTE]Con: Did not deny God chose a group of people and condemned all others. Also Mathew 20:1-16 Is a good parable for work, but for the souls of a human? That\\'s taking it a bit too far. --------------- C: God\\'s \"right\" MkII No. Creation of something does not imply ownership, especially when free-will and sentience are concerned. Also implying that God is above morality is implying the appeal to authority fallacy http://en.wikipedia.org... Please, do not argue that because God is perfect, the system must be perfect. That is beneath you. Note: [Redundancy]: Of course god is \"void of sin\", since to sin is to disobey him. Alrighty, having fun so far and thank you for participating. Lets go to round 3!', 'I feel that any addition to the original post I made might push the debate farther than it should in terms of simplicity and a \"simple read\", although it is already very long. My response in accordance to the points brought up: 1. I\\'m not exactly sure how to go about saying this so I will try to make it as clear as possible. If you are making the point that God is seperate from humanity and that god is holy, seperated, and a different entity: I accept that as per the bible stating it.(I thought this was by default accepted once you accept the bible as tru per the opening). However, your math was off. The punishment of sinning is not only that you are sent to hell, but that God may take your life before that(and then consequently you would go to hell). I want o make this clear because to say that the only punishment God has given for sin in the bible is to to got to hell, is not true. 2. \"Sins of our fathers\". I\\'d like to address the acts that we are all born sinful and that is becaue of the original \"fall\" of Adam and Eve. Romans 5:18-19: 18 Therefore, as one trespass[b] led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness[c] leads to justification and life for all men. 19 For as by the one man\\'s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man\\'s obedience the many will be made righteous. -Let us ignore the Jesus stuff for the sake of the debate. This verse states that all were condemned for the sin of Adam and Eve. The \"father\" of all mankind, made many sinners. Note: You did not respond or explain to people why God killed the several groups of people in the stories of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, where in each the entire group of people were wiped out because they were deemed \"sinful\" or \"corrupt\" in the eyes of God. -You assume that the verses stating that the child will not pay for the sins of the father prove that no child was punished in these genocides unfairly, but that assumption is false. Not only in the sense that all mankind has paid for the sins of Adam, but that these groups of people(children included) were punished for the sins of the mature members. Innocent children were punished (killed) in these acts. Note: I am not proposing that the bible is false, but that the verse was meant for a different interpretation. That being The son shall not bear the responsibility of the father according to the law.(i.e. the 613 commandments in the Old Testament). So that if a father broke the law, the son could not be punished for this. I believe this verse was intended in such a way. -God did kill children. In accordance with the story of Noah, Moses, Sodom and Gomorrah and the Amalekites, all died for their sin(from birth) and the sins of their father. To think that not one child existed in these examples is rather naive, but for an example we can look towards the story of Moses: Exodus 11: 4-7: \"4. So Moses said, \"This is what the Lord says: \"About midnight I will go throughout Egypt. 5 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the female slave, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well. 6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt\"worse than there has ever been or ever will be again. 7 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any person or animal.\" Then you will know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.\" -I\\'d like to note that there are examples of where God himself killed the innocent and where he ordered the Israelites to do such. There is a difference, but I find that the overall effect the same. [On the topic of Born-Sinners] The Bible repeatedly tells us that we are born sinners thanks to adam and eve. In the first part I opened with the assumption that both parties would accept children as being \"innocent\". I make this assumption based upon the notion that children do not fully understand or comprehend the acts that they do and their consequences. I realize that this can also apply to more mature humans, but for children I think we can agree that \"innocence\" is among them to a certain age. This presents a conflicting view. We percieve children as innocent though the bible does not and from birth gives them the effective sentence of Hell, though they could not have possibly disobeyed god. This is effectively \"the sins of the father\", that father being Adam. 3. Deserving of Hell. I\\'d like to make the point that the verse you listed(1corinthians 10:4) is talking aobut the Jewish religion. I.e. the same \"spiritual drink\" and \"unto Moses\" relate to the Old Testament. Of course within the belief that Jesus was God(the trinity), those who already believed in the Jewish God(i.e. the jews), would have technically been believing in Jesus before he came to Earth. However that leaves us with John 14:6 \"6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" So the original meaning of the Corinthians verse is that the Jews would continue their religion by believing in Jesus. This does not apply to the non-jewish people before Jesus, but ot assure the Jews that Christianity is a continuation of their religion. ============================================= The whole point of 3 was that those who could not know of the Law, Jesus, or of the bible were sent to hell, regardless if they are \"Good\" by moral or even biblical standards. It is in accordance with 2, where they are punished not by something they did, but by the sin of Adam. Meaning: People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. ========================================= In response to your edits on P1-3(I\\'d rather you not since this makes it harder to read through later.) P1-3 1.Noah can be called a preacher and Abraham can plead for Sodom, but that has no effect whatsoever on the decision made by God and what it stands for. In response to your assumption that God \"morally\" executed a killer, I deny that. God committed genocide. (Genocide definition: the deliberate killing of a large group of people, especially those of a particular ethnic group or nation.) This is entirely different from the moral justification of killing a specific person or group. The justification for genocide is non-existent. 2. The good people? The people who are for the most part good. Humanitarian, peaceful, non-violent. I\\'d presume there is a general definition of a \"good\" person we can agree on. 3. It is founded on all the scripture, in fact the entire story of the Old Testament is of the Jewish people. To clarify, I was talking of the time before Jesus. Genesis 17:7 \"7 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.\" ==================== Note: You did not edit the closing correctly. You left the phrase \"and punishes those undeserving of punishment\" ========= To summarize: 2.\"Sins of Our Father\" - Adam and Eve: mankind pays the price for generations because of their Sin. The are (according to the bible) the parents of all. -God also murdered select groups of people for the sins of the whole. -God did kill children(listed examples). [Children are innocent] -Yet the God has killed them in the act of Genocide. -Yet God condemns them to hell from their birth. 3. People go to Hell for circumstances that are outside of their control. P1: God does not give a \"second chance\" in the old testament to many groups of people. He simply writes them off as \"too far gone\" and murders them. P2: See 3. P3: God\\'s chosen people(the jews) were the only ones God continually spoke to before Jesus. Leaving primarily them alone to know of God and how to avoid the fate of Hell. C: The system of sin is one that punishes those undeserving of punishment and for circumstances that are beyond a person\\'s control.', 'Hi I\\'ll be on the side of \"Pro\" and will be debating on the subject of Christianity\\'s sin-and-punishment being fair to the human race as a whole. Note: For this debate you must assume the bible is true. The definition of sin is: To go against or disobey god. The definition of Hell is: A place where the souls of mankind who enter are eternally tormented/tortured. I base this on the things god has punished for.(i.e. the forbidden fruit, going against his commands, etc.). ============================ If you wish to post something to this or against it, please do so, but I am not hoping for this to be the main topic. ============================= The system in the bible for sin and it\\'s punishment, is not fair in regards to humanity. 1. \"Sins of our Fathers\" -This applies to the concept in Christianity known as \"our fallen world\" -This applies to God\\'s punishment of people throughout the bible for the sins of their father or great grandfather. The belief of paying for the sins or disobedience of our fathers is unfair. We as humans do not in good moral conscience blame the child for the father\\'s mistakes. We do not give children death sentences because the father murdered. And we do this for a reason, that being that someone who did not participate in the crime should not be blamed or punished, regardless of genetic similarity. 2. Those undeserving of Hell. In the bible there is the belief that whoever sins and does not acquire forgiveness goes to Hell. This is both before and after Jesus, with Jesus being the way to salvation after he ascends to Heaven. P1: God punishes many people throughout the bible without a chance at redemption. This is shown in the Flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, the Amelekites(the list goes on). These people(men, women, and children) all went to hell thanks to God\\'s actions. It sets the standard that God can kill anyone at anytime and send them to an eternal torture. P2: Those who could not have known of God or his religion went to hell regardless of they were \"good\" according to the bible\\'s system. P3: God selects his chosen people, and condemns all others to Hell. According to the Bible, the Jews were God\\'s \"chosen people\", meaning he had forsaken all others to Hell until the time of Jesus and the opening up of the religion thanks to Christianity. C: The system of Sin-and-Punishment the bible presents does not present a fair chance at salvation for all of humanity and punishes those undeserving of punishment.

I\\'ll refute your case in the next round.==Case== FrameworkObservation 1: The primary purpose of punishment prima facieis retribution; rehabilitation is a secondary concern. Crimes are, after all, acts of aggression against victims where as rehabilitation is an act of restoration towards the criminal; it must thus be regarded as fundamentally unjust to put the benefits of the criminal (IE rehabilitation) above the benefits to the victim (IE compensation and retribution). As Michael Moore put it: “We are justified in punishing because and only because offenders deserve it.” Retribution needs to be valued above restoration. Observation 2: Consider only the effects that the implementation of Capital punishment has on the deserving--victims and law abiding citizens (civil socety). Observation 3: Abolish means to do away with entirely. If there\\'s one forseeable case in which Capital Punishment in needed, you negate.Observation 4: Ignore all objections the CP that address issues with the current system (can be reformed). C1: Capital Punishment deters crimeMethodology: We need to apply ceteris paribus when looking at the Death Penalty. We can\\'t compare Texas to New York, or New Jersey to Louisiana for obvious reasons; consider only the relationships between crime and capital punishment in specific places. Empirics: Westley Lowe observed that between 1991 and 1999 there was a 700% increase in the number of executions, along with a drop of 33% in the murder rate. More specifically, in Texas the resumption of executions in 1982 resulted in a 60% drop in the murder rate; within Texas, the Houston area (Harris county, where the polunsky execution unit is housed) the area with the most aggressive death penalty prosecuters reside, experienced a 72% decrease in the murder rate between \\'91-99[1]. This is significant, because it shows not only that nationwide murder decreased but as we get into areas that aggressively impost capital punishment (Texas executes more people than any other state, and Harris county more than any other county) the results are even more substantial! I could bring in more empirical evidence for this, but I don\\'t think it\\'s needed. Academics: Lowes findings on deterrence have been held true in at least three major academic studies, namely: Studies from Emory University stating that each execution prevents between three and eighteen murders. [2] A 2006 study from the University of Houston, stating that the Illinois moratorium on the Death Penalty led to 150 additional homicides [3] A University of Colorado at Denver study showing that for each execution five muders were prevented.[4]. Logic: Of course, not all of the observed decrease in the murder rate is the result of Capital punishment, but there can be little doubt that a just society and \"tough on crime\" laws discourage criminal behavior. A study from the Criminal Justice Statistics Center found that a decrease in violent crime resulted from harsher penalties[5] (specifically defined as \"Increase in, higher probability of, and longer duration of incarceration.\"). The result is you negate since the lives of vicious murderers can\\'t outweigh the lives of innocent civilians. C2: RecidivismCapital Punishment carries with it one incredible advantage, and that is that no executed murderer has ever harmed another individual again. As a matter of fact, of Death Row inmates held in 2009 over 5% committed their capital crime while in prison or on escape, and an amazing 2/3rds were previously convicted of a felony[6]. The last time Capital Punishment was abolished in the United States (1972), dozens of inmates were given sentences of life imprisonment and were later paroled, many of whom killed again, over 25 known victims are the result of these post-furman cases, along with dozens more from escaped or paroled murderers[7]. Two things must be drawn from this: 1. Laws change, parole boards change, rulings change, and people forget the past. The only way to forever ensure that a a murderer doesn\\'t strike again is to kill him. 2. An immediate abolition (as the resolution calls for) would lead to more disasters. To use Texas as an example, life without parole was not implement until late 2005, so all inmates who committed their crimes before then (the vast majority) would be eligible for Parole and one day released[8]. Affirmation leads to deaths by historical precedents. Even behind bars criminals manage to strike again. For example, Clarence Ray Allen, serving a sentence of life imprisonment without parole (the likely alternative) still managed to cause the deaths of still more people: he got a paroled inmate he knew to kill one who testified against him, along with 2 completely innocent bystanders[9]. In an uncharacteristic act of justice and logic, the state of California executed this filth in 2006. He will never harm anyone again. C3: Justice.Refer back to my framework, we can only justifiably punish people because they deserve it, to deny this is absolute insanity! I will lay out two hypothetical (although not unrealistic) scenarios where the Death Penalty should surely be implemented. I have little doubt that my opponent will accuse me of making an \"appeal to emotion\" but since Justice is an emotional construct, theres little use in such an objection. One:How should our society respond to evil?Imagine a pedophile. He has fantasies about little girls, and constantly stalks them on the internet and in person. Constantly. Finally one day he snaps, and kidnaps an innocent little child, around age 6 or 7, takes her into a secluded area, pulls off her clothes, and brutally rapes her as she screams in vain for mercy and help. Finally, because he\\'s a sick and twisted animal, he smashes her head with a rock and runs away. Now, we have two options. We can send him to prison for the rest of his life. We can pay to feed, clothe, protect, entertain, and \"rehabilitate\" him for the rest of his life. We can look the little girls parents in the eye and say, yeah your innocent child had to die, but her killer gets to live off of your dime because we dont want to \"sink to his level\". Sorry. What justice is that? The parents will have to deal with the constant nightmare of knowing that somewhere that predator still lives, and can still harm others; he can potentially escape, or they could (God forbid) have to go through to biannual nightmares of his parole hearings because of a change in sentencing laws (as happened in the sickening James Moore rape/murder case[10].). At the very least they know that he will be sitting in his cell watching television and pleasuring himself on the memories of what he did to their beautiful daughter for the rest of his days, all payed for by them and their fellow law abiding tax payers. Wonderful.Or, we could hang/electrocute/shoot/euthanize/gas him and end it once and for all. It seems that anyone with any moral sense what so ever knows which option is preferable. Two: Imagine for this scenario we have a leader of a militant personality cult, convicted of rape and murder. His followers are fanatic and will fight to the death to protect him, and commit suicide on his command. In the Aff world, he\\'s imprisoned and his followers fight to get him out--they kill dozens of gaurds and lesser inmates in the process before they are all shot. In the Neg world, the man is rightfully executed and his followers commit suicide with him This might be a strange scenario, but recall that even one example where CP is needed is enough to negate. Also imagine a war criminal such as Adolf Hitler. My opponent must prove his system outweighs mine in:1. Deterrence2. Justice3. Recidivism preventionAlong with showing compelling reasons to change the status quo. Before then, the resolution is completely negated. The Death Penalty is a just consequence for those who choose a path of evil. http://www.debate.org...', 'I accept.']\n",

My arguments: Short Overview:I will be using three basic contentions to support my case. The first will show the unnecessary and major risk that will always exist with the death penalty, but does not exist with life imprisonment. The second will show the physchological societal shaping of ones personality and character traits brought about by events in ones life that leads to the fact that certain persons are not at fault for the way they turn out and thus imposing the harshest penalty against them is unjust and we must bend our efforts towards reforming these persons rather than terminating them. The third will show that capital punishment is inefficient in accomplishing the goals of the state, in that there are three main purposes for the state in taking action against law-breakers and capital punishment only performs two of those, while with life imprisonment we have the possibility of accomplishing all three. C.1 As long as the death penalty is in use, there is always the risk of killing innocents. Everyone should agree on the fact that every risk of note existing in our form of punishment aught to be diminished if possible. What about the utmost risk? The risk of the state killing innocent inhabitants of its own jurisdiction? Sadly this still exists through the use of capital punishment. Every time we send someone to their execution there is the possibility that we are sending an innocent man too his death. Why on earth should we allow these risks to take place when there is no need? For there is indeed not much need. Life imprisonment is effective and never includes the chance of killing an innocent man. Those sentenced to life imprisonment have the chance to be proven innocent before they die. Despite what advocates of the death penalty say, innocents being executed are not at all a rare accurance as evidence shows. Well over eighty people in the past quarter century have been condemned but then released before execution. [1] This source shows detailed accounts of eleven innocents being executed. [2] One researcher says he has found at least 74 cases in which wrongful executions have most likely taken place. [2] 69 inmates on death row have been released since 1973 (Source is from 1997 so it would be allot higher now).[3] This clearly shows the risks of the DP. Risks which are completely unnecessary and should be gotten rid of immediately. These men were lucky to escape with their lives. I should add that there have, undoubtedly, been cases in which innocent people have been executed but have not been proved innocent afterwards. After being executed there is not much need for someone to try too prove the innocence of someone who is already dead. So there are undoubtedly instances in the past where we have executed an innocent man but did not know so, and still do not know. With life imprisonment there is zero chance of killing an innocent man. It is a horrible thing for an innocent person to be killed at the hands of the state. It is also completely unnecessary. C.2 Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development theory [9] This theory clearly shows that the way people turn out is based much on their life events. Thus it is not entirely their fault but corrupt society's. Rather than just executing criminals we should realize that one, they are not solely at fault, and two, we have the possibility of reforming them. Now obviously the death penalty is reserved for only the most extreme crimes, and I think it is logical to believe those people who commit these crimes are just products of our corrupt society. This theory demonstrates my argument. Imposing our harshest punishment against those who are not entirely at fault is clearly unjust.Many people are dealt with less harshly due to mental disorders. This follows the same lines. C.3 Those executed cannot be be reformed, or rehabilitated. Capital punishment does not achieve maximum purpose.Why do we take action against law breakers? Punishment Segregation Rehabilitation The ideal form of state action against criminals is one that accomplishes all purposes. This is an obvious fact. Thus whatever accomplishes all three purposes most effectively we must consider superior. With the use of life imprisonment we have the chance of accomplishing all three of these. However with the use of capital punishment the third is impossible, unless they are reformed before they are executed. But it is much more likely they would be reformed if they have their whole life to be reformed. Thus it is safe to conclude life imprisonment is superior too capital punishment. The death penalty deprives criminals of a second chance which SHOULD be given to them. The question is, why would we be using a form of punishment that only accomplishes two of its three main purposes, when there is another option that may accomplish all three? Though it's not completely necessary, here are a few examples. Two murderers, Van Houten and Krenwinkel, were sentenced to life imprisonment, but latter expressed remorse at their actions.[7] If they had been sentenced to death they would never have had the chance to repent. Watson and Atkins, two other murderers, became Christian Fundamentalists after being given a life sentence.[7]With the use of the death penalty the State is not accomplishing what it is supposed too.

A false prophetess cannot be Christ because 1 Christ had to be a male to fulfill the OT prophecies concerning the Messiah being a King. 2 Christ as the Lamb of God had to be without spot or blemish. Here is what Christ said about Thyatira: \"Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling. So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways. I will strike her children dead.\" Revelation 20-23a NIV) Concerning your seconded one liner- Humans are complicated. For instance, I have only been at this here website for a week or two and have come across several posters who claim to have been Christians for years and then after some sort of problem became non-believers, (agnostic, atheistic, etc). So we can easily tie your two one liners together and come up with- (1) Christians are one dimensional. (2) They are incapable of changing their minds or making mistakes. (3) They are mindless robots who follow Christ like zombies. (Sorry about the third one liner at this point but you got one more coming and I wanted to for sure address your last one.)

            "['I would like to begin by thanking my opponent for his response. However, it seems that a majority of his points are new arguments rather than the rebuttals that we had agreed on for round 3. I will, though, respond to them anyway even though the arguments provided by opponent ultimately shouldn\"t be given much weight (due to their not meeting the criteria set for the round). I would also like to note, that my opponent offers no evidence for any of his arguments. [For the purposes of space, I have included only the first and last few words of some of my opponent\\'s longer arguments; the full arguments can be seen in the previous round] 1-\"[I]t\"s glorified infidelity.\" This is not the case. Infidelity is described as \"marital disloyalty; adultery.\"[1] Voluntary polygamous marriage (VPM) certainly does not meet the prior criterion; one partner is never being disloyal to a married partner by being with another married partner of the same marriage; it is the same marriage. The second criterion should probably be defined in its own right. Adultery is \"voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and someone other than his or her lawful spouse.\"[2] So, VPM also fails to meet the second criterion of infidelity because a partner would be having sex with someone who is his or her lawful spouse. 2-\"It would be difficult for the government to tax.\" Taxation is already a difficult process, but I suppose my opponent is suggesting that VPM would make taxation even more difficult. I agree that this would likely be the case, but I would also point out that this is merely because it is currently a practice that is not recognized by the state. Marriage reform tends to necessitate tax reform. Introducing either interracial marriage or same-sex marriage into a system that criminalized and discriminated against them would likely force some kind of marriage-related tax reform. My opponent\"s argument here can only be taken seriously if s/he also discourages interracial and same-sex marriage. 3-\"Relationships should be between two people.\" This is entirely without grounding or warrant. To use an earlier example, it could be just as easy to say \"relationships should be between two people of the same race\" or \"relationships should be between people of different sexes.\" Merely stating these things is not a good reason to criminalize interracial or same-sex marriage. 4-\"Couples have to... there\"s multiple people.\" Following my opponent\"s logic here would yield disastrous results. For example, families also have to make decisions and compromises together. It is harder to agree when there are more people. Having children increases the number of people in a family. Therefore, people should not have children. Of course, if everybody did this, it would result in human extinction. 5-\"Polygamous relationships can... is already overpopulated.\" Actually, because the female reproductive system can only create a single child at a time (discounting multiple births), any form of polygamy could not increase the population more than monogyny could (assuming a roughly equal proportion of men and women in the world). 6-\"Polygamy is almost... being owned by men.\" Remember, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. If the woman\"s act is not voluntary, then it is not relevant to this debate. 7-\"Marriage is a... a cattle drive.\" A VPM can also be a partnership and a relationship; it is simply between more people. 8-\"Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women.\" This is true. I fail to see how this is necessarily disadvantageous. 9-\"Most people agree... to older men.\" Again, this is VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage. Joel Feinberg classifies the choice of a child as \"substantially nonvoluntary.\"[3] I think many people would agree. 10-\"Spouses can have... it creates tension.\" This is true. Marriage is difficult, but I fail to see how this justifies laws against VPM. 11-\"The established needs... around the house.\" My opponent has offered no evidence to support this. Even if s/he had, it would not provide a convincing justification for laws against VPM. 12-\"In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status.\" This seems unlikely, especially when you consider that there are societies in which polyandry is the predominant form of polygamy.[4] Even if this were the case, my opponent would also have to show that polygamy is the cause of this lower in each of these cultures for this argument to have much weight. 13-\"True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people.\" Even if this were the case, it is not a good justification for laws against VPM because \"true love\" is not a prerequisite for marriage. 14-\"Most North American... or food stamps.\" That is unfortunate, but unless my opponent is suggesting that VPM is the cause of this, the argument does not hold much weight. If s/he is suggesting that VPM is the cause, then the argument seems to be guilty of a cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. 15-\"Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices.\" I agree. 16-\"Legalizing polygamy would... on women\"s rights.\" This is completely unwarranted; I could just as easily say \"legalizing VPM would not give more power to religions and would not infringe on women\"s rights.\" Also, in terms of women\"s rights, I would also like to remind my opponent that the resolution deals with VOLUNTARY polygamous marriage and that a woman has just as much right to marry multiple men. 17-\"Legal polygamy would... to such marriages.\" My opponent assumes that nations are obligated to grant citizenship to immigrants merely because they are married to a citizen of that nation. However, my opponent offered no reason for us to accept this assumption. Some final notes: I-While my opponent offered a larger number of arguments, a multitude of arguments should not be confused for acumen. II-Though I have argued against my opponent\"s new arguments, s/he offered them in a round dedicated to rebuttals, and because of this, I was given far less opportunity to rebut them. III-My opponent did not refute my initial arguments. This is incredibly important because it means that my final syllogism, which firmly negates the resolution, stands. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Also, any new arguments against this portion of my initial argument would be incredibly unfair to the spirit of this debate as I am now completing my final round and would be unable to respond to them. So, ultimately, my syllogism has been unrefuted and its ultimate conclusion that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just must stand. Finally, I would like to thank my opponent for his or her participation in this debate. Sources: [1] http://dictionary.reference.com... [2] http://dictionary.reference.com...

(Pg. 81)', 'It is unfortunate that my opponent was unable to respond to my arguments, so I will try to make my arguments this round briefer. I would first like to address my definition of polygamy, which has gone unrefuted. Talbott\"s definition of legal paternalism is \"the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard).[1] This definition is important because it supports the first premise of my syllogism in C3. Next, my argument in C1 went unrefuted as well. This Millian argument showed that a certain type of legal paternalism (strong/hard) is not just. This argument is significant because it proves the second premise of my syllogism in C3. My opponent also failed to refute my argument in C2. This showed that laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism because they fail to meet the criteria of such forms of paternalism. This argument is important because it supports the third premise of my syllogism in C3. Finally, with all of the premises of my syllogism warranted, my conclusion (that laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just) necessarily follows. As a reminder, the following is the syllogism to which I am referring. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) I have already supported 1-3. 4 follows from a disjunctive syllogism of premises 1 and 3. Because laws against polygamy are a type of paternalism, which is either strong/hard or weak soft and laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not weak/soft, they must be strong/hard. 5, which disproves the resolution, necessarily follows because of the rules of identity on 2 and 4. Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism, strong/hard paternalism is not just; thus, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. This relies on the same reasoning that tells us that when A=B and B=C that A=C. [1] Talbott, William. \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism.\" Which Rights Should Be Universal? Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print. (Pg. 53)', 'As far as I can tell, the only mention of polygamy in debates here so far have been in passing, so I hope everyone can enjoy looking at it a little bit closer. With debates concerning same-sex marriage currently taking over cable news channels, quite a bit has been said about \"the sanctity of marriage. \" People have questioned whether marriage should only be between one man and one woman or if it can also extend to one man and another man or one woman and another woman. While a great amount can be said about this subject, I turn my attention instead to a single word used in the rhetoric; that word is \"one. \" It seems that whether groups are advocating same-sex marriage or rejecting it, they believe that marriage is a commitment between one person and one other person only. On some level, this reflects the anti-polygamy sentiment of modern society. In fact, Edward Stein states \"that polygamy has never been legal in any [U. S. ] state. \" He adds that the U. S. Supreme Court \"effectively denied that there is a right to marry more than one person at the same time\" in Reynolds v. United States. [1] In this debate, I will argue that is no just basis for laws against voluntary polygamous marriage. Before progressing any further, it would be beneficial to actually define polygamy. Generally, polygamy can be defined as marriage between more than two partners. Alan S. Miller and Satoshi Kanazawa note that polygamy is often confused with polygyny. They add that \"polygyny is the marriage of one man to more than one woman. \" On the other hand, polygamy can also include polyandry, \"the marriage of one woman to more than one man. \"[2] It should be mentioned that both polygyny and polyandry require that the relationship be heterosexual; I will not give much consideration to homosexual polyamory in this debate because doing so would require even more complex distinctions than those already made and does not even meet the technical definition of polygamy. Additionally, I would no like to define an important term in my arguments, which is legal paternalism. In \"Weak and Strong Legal Paternalism,\" William Talbott explains that \"[a] law is paternalistic if it is enacted to promote the good of the target audience by overruling their own judgment about what is good for them. \" He adds that \"[l]egal paternalism is the enactment and enforcement or paternalistic laws,\" which can be either weak (also called soft) or strong (also called hard). [3] C1-I would like to first explore why some kinds of paternalism (strong/hard) can be considered unjust. In On Liberty, John Stuart Mill makes a convincing argument against legal paternalism being just. Mill claims that \"neither one person, nor any number of persons, is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that he shall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do with it. \" He explains that this is because \"[h]e is the person most interested in his own well-being, the interest which any other person… can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has\" and \"with respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be possessed by anyone else. \"[4] So, Mill suggests that a fully-capable adult is the most reliable judges on what is good for her because no other person is as interested in that person\\'s good as she is. Of course, this means that other people as well as governments are less reliable judges. Thus, legal paternalism is generally not justified. Mill does provide some exceptions to this; such exceptions are weak/soft paternalism. C2-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage do not meet the standards of either major theory of weak/soft paternalism. A-They do not meet Mill\\'s standards. In fact, Mill directly addresses polygamy. He explains that the particular Mormon belief \"which is the chief provocative to the antipathy which thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance, is its sanction of polygamy. \"[5]. Mill admits that he strongly disapproves of the practice, but he concludes that polygamy should not be prohibited. He notes \"that this relation is as much voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who may be deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of the marriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, it has its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, which teaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelligible that many a woman should prefer being one of several wives, to not being a wife at all. \"[6] Whether or not the latter claim here represents an outdated worldview, the prior is certainly still relevant today. B-They do not meet Joel Feinberg\\'s standards. In \"Legal Paternalism,\" Feinberg describes a weak form of paternalism. According to Feinberg, \"the state has the right to prevent self-regarding harmful conduct when but only when it is substantially nonvoluntary or when temporary intervention is necessary to establish whether it is voluntary or not. \"[7] Such an intervention is certainly paternalistic, but it is a weak form of paternalism and, as such, is justifiable. Feinberg describes a voluntary act as one that \"represent[s] the agent faithfully in some important way… [and] express[es] his or her settled values and preferences. \"[8] If the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed about the particular circumstances of his or action, that action would not be considered voluntary. So, another person would be justified in preventing the agent from acting if that person believed the agent is somehow ignorant, uninformed, or misinformed. However, such an intervener would be justified in intervening long enough to establish whether the agent\\'s action is voluntary or not. Of course, the resolution deals with voluntary polygamous marriage, so laws against it certainly are not weak/soft. In Harm to Self, Feinberg addresses polygamy more directly. He asserts that \"there are no convincing liberal reasons for the\" prohibition of polygamy. Feinberg then makes the slightly stronger claim \"that there should be no such crime [against polygamy] at all\". [9] This seems consistent with his account from \"Legal Paternalism. \" If an act is clearly voluntary, then paternalistic intervention is not justified. C3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just. To prove this, I offer the following syllogism based on my arguments so far. 1-Paternalism is either strong/hard or weak/soft (by definition) 2-Strong (or hard) legal paternalism is not just (by C1) 3-Laws against voluntary polygamous marriages are not weak/soft paternalism (by C2) 4-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are strong/hard paternalism (by disjunctive syllogism 1, 3) 5-Therefore, laws against voluntary polygamous marriage are not just (by identity 2, 4) Sources: [1] Stein, Edward. \"Past and Present Proposed Amendments to the United States Constitution Regarding Marriage. \" Washington University Law Quarterly 82.3 (2004): 611-685.

            "['Can my opponent counter ay of the following points in any way? t’s glorified infidelity. It would be difficult for the government to tax. Relationships should be between two people. Couples have to make decisions and compromises together, and it’s harder to agree when there’s multiple people. Polygamous relationships can end up with too many children. The world is already overpopulated. Polygamy is almost never polyandry. It’s not about women’s freedom to choose who they marry or how many spouses they have- it’s about women being owned by men. Marriage is a partnership and a relationship. Polygamy turns marriage into a cattle drive. Polygamy skews the natural ratio of marriageable men and women. Most people agree that countries that practice polygamy live in an oppressive, abusive society with fanatical, religious men- especially when they marry young girls to older men. Spouses can have animosity, jealousy, etc towards other the other spouses and it creates tension. The established needs are impossible to meet in a polygamist marriage. These needs include- ongoing affection/attention, conversation, honesty and openness, financial support, and help around the house. In all polygamous cultures, women have extremely low status. True love is a bond that is only possible to be shared between two people. Most North American “families” in polygamous situations are on welfare or food stamps. Polygamy is a choice, while sexual orientations are not choices. Legalizing polygamy would give more power to religions, and would infringe on women’s rights. Legal polygamy would turn immigration into a nightmare. An immigrant can claim to be wed to half a nation of women and demand that all these women be brought to, say, the US. Polygamists can arrive at the border and demand refugee status because of persecution. Sorting out these claims would be impossible, since most nations refuse to give legal status to such marriages.', 'I accept.One thing though.Just: guided by truth, reason, justice, and fairness.[1]Polygamy: the practice or condition of having more than one spouse,especially wife, at one time.[2]Sources:[1] http://dictionary.reference.com...[2] http://dictionary.reference.com...;']\n",

I searched three reliable sites for \"States that have laws against girls playing American Football\", and I did not find anything against them playing football. The biggest thing against women playing football was that they should find a different sport to play. Others call it \"Abusive\" for a woman to play football. However, I do not find this t obe abusive, and if it happened to be abusive, you could not blame coaches, teamates, or the opposing team, you blame her for getting into this game. This was a very fine debate. Thank you for your time, and good luck.', 'Reading the laws of other states, there is no law that says something like 7B: Women can\\'t play football with men. There are absolutely no laws in other states that say that women can\\'t play football. With my football experience, I have seen girls playing the sport. You know too,we played Atrisco Valley, and that girl who played as well, if not better, than some of the boys we have seen playing. Also, I have seen in a few, but not all of the High Schools have at least one girl playing for their team.There is one girl division The Augusta National division, which is for girls. Also, with some research I have found that there are girl football divisions in Germany. Not the \"soccer\" type football, as they call it in England, but actual American-type football. So yes, there are girl divisions for American football.', \"Many people say that women can not play football. However, I have found that when they say this, they say women are weak. Women are not given the chance to try football past the Young American Football League (YAFL). But if men think women can't play because of politics, they are not familiar with the laws.

            "[\"First of all, Did you read the Youth Football rules for all 49 other states? Also, as the age increase for players, so does the competitiveness among players. When you have read the NMAA rules for High School football then you can rebuke me, but until then your argument on youth rules is invalid. YAFL allows females to play because, although we are competitive, we will not intentionally hurt them unless a player is a sociopath. I'm not doubting a women;s ability to play football I'm just saying that they would be a distraction and would not all be able to play the amount of required playing time. Don't get me wrong, omen can play but very few have the stamina and concentration to compete at the high school level. Let me ask you something, specifically what playing level are we talking about? you started with Professional but then we moved to high school and YAFL. There is another youth football league on the East Coast ( POP WARNER ) that encourages women play the good sport of football, but like I said before there is no platform for women's professional football anywhere in our country.... BTW Augusta National Division is NCAA not pro. thank you.\", 'Your argument id valid, however there is no other professional level of football in America other than the NFL (National Football League ) and the Arena Football League ( NOT sure on actual name ) which also prohibits women from playing. some states may vary on rules, but in New Mexico women are prohibited from playing football with men ( due to age and other variables), and there isnt enough interested women in football to create a whole division just for women. Besides if Women were aloud to play football they would be a distraction, and studies have proven that they fatigue faster then Men.']\n",

The main difference however, is the storytelling aspect of dance. Dance exists to tell a story through movement and music. That is something sports simply do not do.

In reality, even reports suggesting a 6.6% gap [28] have had errors pointed out in them. Academic Christina Hoff Sommers [29] writes: \"Economics majors (66 percent male) have a median income of $70,000; for sociology majors (68 percent female) it is $40,000. Economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Manhattan Institute has pointed to similar incongruities. The AAUW study classifies jobs as diverse as librarian, lawyer, professional athlete, and \"media occupations\" under a single rubric--\"other white collar.\" \"One report from the U.S. Dept. of Labor shows that the pay gap is \"almost entirely\" due to individual choices, and not discrimination [30]. d) Bias in Wikipedia [The Guardian, 2015] Wikipedia were recently forced to ban 5 editors fron Gender-related articles [31]. 7.

            "[\"One of Barack Obama's main rallying cries is that Washington is broken, that John McCain and Hillary Clinton have been part of the problem, not the solution. But the only thing Obama will do is expand Washington's power and control like WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN OUR 200+ YEARS AS A COUNTRY (with exception to the New Deal, from the socialist democrat darling FDR). Through nationalized health care, increasing taxes, environmental protectionism, business and corporate regulation, and more bureaucracy, Obama's future plan for Washington makes no sense at all with his original claim. If Washington is the problem and we need change, expanding Washington's power and control is the exact opposite solution that we need. His stance makes no sense and is completely irrational.\", '\"Okay, so let\\'s stop taxing companies. Then our government will be even more broken, because it won\\'t be able to pay for anything. Good idea.\" I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms. It is the upper class that runs the businesses that the lower class works. \"And I guarantee you they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes.\" Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \"Taxing to pay for government programs isn\\'t Marxist. And guess waht? The government has the right, BY THE CONSTITUTUION, to tax.\" Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. And for taxes (from the Wall Street Journal): \"Mr. Obama has recently veered sharply left. He now proposes to solve the looming Social Security shortfall exclusively with higher taxes. …Currently, all wages below about $100,000 are subject to a 12.4% Social Security payroll tax. But all wages above that amount are not subject to the tax. Mr. Obama wants to eliminate the cap, but, in a concession to taxpayers, exempt wages between $100,000 and $200,000. …Mr. Obama\\'s plan would keep Social Security in the black for only three additional years. Under his proposal, annual deficits would hit in 2020, instead of 2017. By the 2030s the system would still run an annual deficit exceeding $150 billion. Mr. Obama\\'s modest improvements to Social Security\\'s financing come at a steep cost. …The top marginal federal tax rates would effectively increase to 50.3% from 37.9%, equivalent to repealing the Bush income tax cuts almost three times over. If one accounts for behavioral responses, even the modest budgetary improvements from Mr. Obama\\'s plan are likely to be overstated. If employers reduce wages to cover their increased payroll-tax liabilities, these wages would no longer be subject to state or federal income taxes, or Medicare taxes. A 2006 study by Harvard economist and Obama adviser Jeffrey Liebman concluded that roughly 20% of revenue increases from raising the tax cap would be offset by declining non-Social Security taxes. Assuming modest negative behavioral responses, Mr. Liebman projected an additional 30% reduction in net revenues, leaving barely half the intended revenue intact. Mr. Obama\\'s plan would also dramatically raise incentives for tax evasion, further degrading revenue gains. Many high-earning individuals evade the Medicare payroll tax by setting up \"S Corporations,\" paying themselves in untaxed dividends rather than taxable wages. John Edwards avoided $590,000 in Medicare taxes this way in the 1990s. …The U.S. already collects far more Social Security taxes from high earners than other countries do. Social Security taxes here are currently capped at about three times the national average wage — far above other developed countries. In Canada and France payroll taxes are levied only up to the average wage. In the United Kingdom, taxes stop at 1.15 times the average wage; in Germany and Japan at 1.5 times.\" Barack Obama is a radical leftist.', '\"This fallacy is that the only possible way to fix governmental problems is to limit the government. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems.\" I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem. His solution is to expand Washington like we\\'ve never seen. How does his position make any sense? \"On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people.\" Since when was it the government\\'s responsibility to provide health care for its people? It is no where in the Constitution. Health care is not a right. And dont even get me started on the expenses of national healthcare for 300,000,000 people. \"On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational. The government is \"broken\" here because it is inefficient in protecting the environment. Obama wants to change that.\" a) global warming is a crock of sh**. b) carbon dioxide is not a pollutant. Even if you believe in global warming hysteria, the percentage of pollution caused from CO2 (businesses) is minimal. Putting the environment as a priority of the economy is mentally insane.

This is the liberal agenda...ideology over common sense. \"On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot...

This is a tactic right out of the Marxist playbook. Why are liberals so fond of socialism? Have they not learned from history? \"Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational.\" Ya thats a brilliant idea. Let\\'s raise taxes (at a rate we\\'ve never seen in our lives) during a time in our country where our economy is in a recession and our consumer confidence level is at a 26 year low. THIS IS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL. How does raising taxes during an economic crisis make any sense whatsoever?']\n",
            "['First, I\\'d like to point out that my opponent has dropped every point but the point about taxes. So, I will only be focusing on this in the final round, and you can assume that the CON won those points, since he obviously has no response. Right here, since he didn\\'t flow thorugh with the other issues, I should win on a basic cost-benefit analysis. But I\\'ll show you why he\\'s wrong about taxes before letting you get to the vote. \"I\\'m not saying stop taxing companies completely. I\\'m saying that the government needs to roll back the taxes on corporate America. The economy is a trickle-down effect. When corporate America can operate and grow the economy, jobs are created and prosperity blooms.

BUt, individuals (both people and companies) tend to spend less during recessions, which only makes matters worse. So, if we get more money to the government for programs so they can SPEND THAT MONEY, it actually helps the problems of the recession. You see, the government is pretty much guaranteed to spend that money. So, it\\'s not making the recession worse at all to tax. \"Of course they\\'re still going to outsource. Do you know how much cheaper it is to do business outside of the United States? Why do you think the private sector continues to outsource? It\\'s because our government over-taxes and over-regulates corporate America. \" You just contradicted yourself. You said that they\\'d still outsource with or without taxes, and then you say taht they outsource because of taxes. Which is it? The fact of the matter is, you\\'re blaming outsourcing on overtaxing (when you haven\\'t even given numbers as to this overtaxing), when they\\'ll do it either way. Things like this are why Obama wants some regulation. \"Again, you didnt read closely enough. I didnt say taxing was marxist. I said redistribution of wealth was and is marxism. You cannot dispute that fact. \" And you missed the point of my original argument. It\\'s not a redistribution of wealth. It\\'s taxing so we can pay for government programs. That\\'s basic. And I\\'m glad that you brought up that Wall Street Journal article, because you obviously didn\\'t read it. It\\'s just paraphrased. Actually, you didn\\'t even paraphrase it, did you? No. You took the paraphrasing from Cato at Liberty, which is the blog of the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian think-tank. Here\\'s the page you got it from: . http://www.cato-at-liberty.org... So. .. You\\'re basically taking something out of context that a BIASED THINK TANK took out of context. Here\\'s the real article is: . http://online.wsj.com...

This is my favorite part: \"His proposal would be a very large tax hike, yet it won\\'t be enough. \" It continues: \"Mr. Obama\\'s plan fixes less than half of Social Security\\'s long-term deficit, making further tax increases inevitable. The Policy Simulation Group\\'s Gemini model estimates that Mr. Obama\\'s proposal, if phased as Mr. Obama suggests, would solve only part of the problem. A 10 year phase-in, for example, would address only 43% of Social Security\\'s 75-year shortfall. And this is assuming that Congress would save the surplus from the tax increases -- almost $600 billion over 10 years -- rather than spending it, as Congress does now. \" I\\'ll let you read the rest of it for yourself. So, you see, the problem isn\\'t that the taxes are messing things up, as you\\'re trying to imply. In fact, the problem is that the taxes aren\\'t enough! If anything, it would require more taxes! Ladies and gentlemen, my opponent only has the point of taxes left going into Round Four, and this doesn\\'t even flow through. He used his sources out of context and wrong, when in fact they supported a point contrary to what he was trying to get across. Even if you want to accept a few of his points, even if you think that Obama isn\\'t the right choice for president, he has, in no way, proven that Obama is irrational.', 'Oh, and just watch the straw man burn... \"I\\'m not saying other options are irrational, I\\'m saying that Barack Obama is irrational when he says Washington is broken and is the problem.

There are multiple ways to fix these problems, and Obama\\'s plan is one. It\\'s not irrational.

He\\'s trying to fix it so that those who need health care but can\\'t afford it can get it. Whether it\\'s in the Constitution or not, the government is there because of the social contract. Therefore, it provides for it\\'s citizens. Obama is trying to suggest a way to make the government provide for the citizenry better, whether it is required to or not.

While this is certainly an option, it is not the only option, and other options are not irrational. There is no reason why creating the right programs within the government can\\'t correct certain governmental problems. Now, looking at my opponent\\'s case against Obama point by point. On health care, Obama wants to create a system where people that need health care can get it. Obama says that Washington is \"broken\" here, because the government fails to provide for its people. On environmental protectionism, yeah, he wants to protect the environment. Using the government as a tool to reduce pollution isn\\'t\\' in the least bit irrational.

On business regulation, we live in a time where companies outsource and here illegal immigrants a lot. Some regulation is a good thing in order to keep these companies in line so they serve Americans as best they can. The government is \"broken\" here because it fails to keep these companies in line. On taxes, Obama wants to repeal certain tax cuts on the upper classes in order to pay for these programs. I realize a lot of people don\\'t like taxes, but the money for correcting these problems has to come from somewhere. Obama has, several times, admitted that fixing these problems won\\'t be easy, and that we\\'ll all have to make sacrifices. This is true. If it means that you have to pay higher taxes, deal with it. It\\'s not irrational. As far as the bureaucracy goes, I don\\'t\\' see any evidence for this. It really just seems like a straw man argument. In order for you to accept my opponent\\'s case, you have to accept that the only rational solution to governmental problems is libertarianism. While I do not negate the possible advantages of libertarianism, it is not the openly rational solution. There is no reason why putting certain governmental programs in place can\\'t correct certain problems. Just because you don\\'t think Obama\\'s plan is the best doesn\\'t make it irrational.']\n",
            "[\"Alright. First things first (I'm the realest..gosh that song's old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, let's again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, I'd like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isn't anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up. Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues. After all, what good is trying to organize countries at war?\", 'First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. I\\'d like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldn\\'t be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I don\\'t believe that\\'s a large enough amount to carry any significance in it. As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. I\\'d like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these \"superwars\" that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000). Next, wars don\\'t occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed country\\'s biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesn\\'t take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention. We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also. War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.', 'As for the topic of the debate: I do believe that global warming is not our greatest issue. World peace is an issue of the utmost urgency. Pro states that despite having wars, \"we are still alive and \\'healthy. \\'\" However, I\\'d like to point out that our world is in turmoil today. Global warming only causes fiercer storms, while the agitation in the world produces a much sharper hunger for a reaction.']\n",
            "['Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the \"point of no return.\" Haven\\'t heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a \"runaway\" in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things don\\'t change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we don\\'t stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the world\\'s economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isn\\'t very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroy\\'s their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?', \"First, this is my first time debating, so apologizes for some mistakes Argument: Hunger you say? That's going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesn't kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years? [1] http://goo.gl...\", 'Global Warming. It is our biggest issue. I didn\"t choose world peace because we were always be fighting. For as long as we have lived, we have fought. And yet, we are still alive and \"healthy\". Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isn\"t going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, it\"s evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that it\"s incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.']\n",
            "['First I may have the burden of proof but my opponent still needs to prove his case and back it up, and show proof of his claims. opponents first refutation.The roots of my argument is not what he claims. The basis of my position is that pornographic actors are the same as prostitutes. Since prostitution is illegal, and since porn stars are just legal prostitutes. Then pornography(legal prostitution rings) should be illegal. Also Pornography includes child porn witch my opponent never even tackled. Also porn sites easily allow children to break the law and veiw porn. witch is illegal. lastly that pornography Is detrimental. In my case I am not saying that pornography is a direct cause of rape, But that pornography is a major contributing factor, influence,and promotes rape....etc.....he says showing kids watch this stuff is irrelevant......Not true children viewing pornography is illegal. Since were talking about legality this is obviously relevant. Also I don\\'t need to show why pornography should be legal. Thats my opponents job. Also my opponent no where in this entire debate explained why pornography should be legal. He attempted to tackle my case but forgot to validate his own.Also if people in a marriage are curious about sex then get under the covers with your partner. Get in the boat and make some waves. Don\\'t look at porn when you have a perfectly good partner whom your married to and can have sex with. Why fantasise about sex rather than having sex????\" as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image.\"Untrue no wife respects the fact that the husband feels he has to look at porn rather than having sex with him. Because the husband chooses to look at other women this causes the wife to feel unwanted. So viewing porn actually hurts the spouses self esteem........Pornography could make it difficult for your spouse to see sex as a loving form of communication. As a result, pornography can decrease sexual satisfaction within your marriage.my opponents second rebuttalfirst let m prove that pornography is addictive............http://en.wikipedia.org...If you feel that not enough look at the sources cited within my source. So pornography is obviously the cause of porn addiction( just think of the wording). Also if the problem is not enough sex with the spouse. then either divorce them and go find sex or cheat. Don\\'t veiw pornography because its detrimental. especially while married. My opponent says...\" a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. Please lets emphasize on the word A. Yes it is one cause but there is one universal reason people veiw porn. to see legal prostitutes have sex or masturbate. Here\\'s evidence that masturbation decreases penile sensitivity........http://www.medhelp.org.........look at the first couple of comments ..........here\\'s a better source............http://www.articledashboard.com...It affects our country because we have a legal prostitution industry. If porn actors are legal , then prostitution should be legalized. But since its not, and since were a count, based on fairness since prostitution is illegal then pornography should be illegal because porn actors are just prostitutes. Lastly pornography doesnt cause rape but promotes it. Due to the fact that after viewing you of coarse want to have sex. Some cant get a partner. After a while some may get too frustrated and just decide to rape someone because there so backed up.....lol...( my opponent never effectively commented on this).Sex isnt the only thing that porn shows. It shows pictures, masturbation, bondage,masturbation,children,and bestiality. Educating people about sex wont prevent rape. Nor will it change any probability of how porn effects the brain.( just to point this out my opponent calls porn a vile insidious substance, witch supports my case)Lastly if porn is illegal and no one had access to it then people wont have to worry about jail because they couldn\\'t get there hands on it. If I was wrong and they could . Then since its illegal then obviously some legal punishment needs to occur. Are you suggesting that the legal system do nothing if it was illegal??? MY opponents counter to my second argument:My argument is not faulty my opponents counter is faulty though......So since prostitution is illegal and since the person chooses to do it then its not illegal????? This is what my opponent is trying to convince the voter of. Faulty logic.He also says he wants to legalize prostitution. If we legalize prostitution, People who get kidnapped and forced into it may never be found. Since there\\'s no police involvement how will these kidnappies be rescued???? Also in prostitution were to be legalised, we all know there is alot of drugs and gang bang rape. The prostitute may think its just a normal have sex with the john and then go. But behind that dark alley or hotel room door there may be 10 men waiting to rape them. If it was legal then these instances would increase dramatically. Since there would be no police hounding here activity.My opponent says porn reduces crimenot true. His source for his statistics are invalid. To test this hypothesis we would need to know whos going to commit crime before hand. We would also need to find out if these criminals are veiwing porn before they commit crime. The after we know theve been caught and done the crime then we could possibly make a conclusion.....since this experiment is impossible since we don\\'t know who\\'s going to commit a crime before hand this is not valid. In my case I have proven that rape promotes rape or is a contributing factor psychologically. therefore this point shouldn\\'t even be considered.Also about his fifth source a conclusion cannot be made unless we know at what year this study was conducted. Thus not valid.Also I never said that pornography causes rape crimes. My point is that pornography may promote rape and is a contributing factor. Since my opponent cannot successfully rebuttal this, it still is valid.EconomyIf the porn industry was abolished that money could be spent else where to stimulate our economy. Or atleast keep some extra money in our pockets. Also Not all porn has a cost. Most people look at free porn. Lastly we don\\'t have a porn taxabout the first amendmentporn is dissemination. But so is terrorist activity on the web. So in my opponents logic we should allow terrorists to share info of terror via the Internet......... The limit on dissemination is if there is threat or if it contradicts the law. Since prostitution is against the law and since prostitution is the same as porn actors then this contradicts the law.freedom of expression from government interference.........if this is the case then why does the government tax us.Lastly the constitution does not protect porn. Freedom of speech and freedom of action are two different things....prostitution is not freedom of speech it is a obscene act unacceptable in our society and is a action.Also porn is considered obscene and obscenity is not protected by the constitution................http://www.covenanteyes.com...( im out of characters, Please look at my case)Sourceshttp://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://downloads.frc.org......http://downloads.frc.org......http://www.heritage.org......http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org......http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com......http://www.protectkids.com......http://www.covenanteyes.com....http://www.articledashboard.com....http://www.medhelp.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...', 'I will be defending the fact that pornography shouldn\\'t be legal do to some fundamental facts. I will use logic and studies to prove my case.Pornography- is the depiction of sexual behavior that is intended to arouse sexual excitement in its audience. prostitute- a person who receives payment for sexual intercourse or other sexual acts, generally as a regular occupation.porn industry-consists of businesses which either directly or indirectly provide sex-related products and services or adult entertainment. The porn industry includes adult sex-related products and services such as prostitution in all its forms.pornographic actors/porn star- Most notably these performers are not paid directly by their sexual partners for the sex, but both are paid through a studio or Talent Management Agency.I will explain that pornography is detrimental,allows children to illegally view pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Pornographic actors is the same as prostitution,Also pornography includes all of its branches. Witch means my opponent will need to defend child porn,animal porn etc.....1.Pornography is detrimental to societyDaily \"child pornography\" requests---- 116,000Websites offering illegal child pornography----- 100,000Adults admitting to Internet sexual addiction----10%http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com...KEY FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHYTHE FAMILY AND PORNOGRAPHY• Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their conjugal relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Wives notice and are upset by the difference.• Pornography use is a pathway to infidelity and divorce, and is frequently a major factor in these family disasters.• Among couples affected by one spouse’s addiction, two-thirds experience a loss of interest in sexual intercourse.• Both spouses perceive pornography viewing as tantamount to infidelity.http://downloads.frc.org...THE INDIVIDUAL AND PORNOGRAPHY• Pornography is addictive, • Users tend to become desensitized to the type of pornography they use, become bored with it, and then seek more perverse forms of pornography.• Men who view pornography regularly have a higher tolerance for abnormal sexuality, including rape, sexual aggression, and sexual promiscuity. Child-sex offenders are more likely to view pornography regularly or to be involved in its distribution.OTHER EFFECTS http://downloads.frc.org...Pornography, distorts an individual’s concept of sexual relations by objectifying them, which, in turn, alters both sexual attitudes and behavior. It is a major threat to marriage, to family, to children, and to individual happiness.Social scientists, clinical psychologists, and biologists concur.http://www.heritage.org...Effect on the mind: Pornography is very addictive. Some effects of porn addiction are: Escalation/Desensitization: Addicts experience an ever-increasing lust and a craving for more intense porn. Eventually \"soft-core\" porn is not stimulating enough, which pushes them into \"hard-core.\" It is a downward spiral. Dissatisfaction with your sex life: Spouses of addicts are affected as sex does not satisfy the addict as it once did. Men who look at porn are dissatisfied by their wife\\'s appearance and this often leads to dysfunctional relationships. Addiction to masturbation: Those addicted to porn are almost always addicted to masturbation. The sexual urges become so strong that masturbation becomes the easiest way of release. Shame and guilt: Emotional pain is perhaps the most common effect of porn addiction. A deep sense of failure and shame is often experienced. \"Lonerism\" and Secrecy: Porn addicts generally keep to themselves and keep their addiction secret. This often results in dysfunctional relationships. http://www.allaboutlifechallenges.org... Pornography affects people’s emotional lives. Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their marital sexual relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Women married to men with a pornography addiction report feelings of betrayal, mistrust, and anger. Pornographic use may lead to infidelity and even divorce. Adolescents who view pornography feel shame, diminished self-confidence, and sexual uncertainty. http://downloads.frc.org... Pornography hurts adults, children, couples, families, and society. Either by promoting overly aggressive,child pornography,Pornography has significant effects during all stages of family life. For a child exposed to pornography within a family setting, pornography causes stress and increases the risk for developing negative attitudes about the nature and purpose of human sexuality. For adolescents who view pornography, their attitudes toward their own and others’ sexuality change, and their sexual expectations and behavior are shaped accordingly. For adults, pornography has harmful and even destructive effects on marriage. Pornography is more detrimental then beneficial thus should not be practiced. 2.allows children to illegally veiw pornography due to an inadequate age confirmation system. Porn sites don\\'t do much to prevent children from viewing. There required by law to ask if your 18 or 21 in some states. On most if not all porn sites you just have to press a button. Yes or no. There\\'s no birthday check or anything like that witch could single children out to disallow access. Porn is very much available to children. Access to pornography is available from early on. The average age of a child’s first exposure to pornography is 11. A total of 90 percent of children ages 8-16 have viewed pornography online. Pornographers use many character names that appeal to children such as “Pokémon.”.........http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com... According to The Kaiser Family Foundation report (found at www.kff.org), 70% of teenagers (ages 15-17 \"have accidentally come across pornography on the Web.\"....... According to one study, early exposure (under fourteen years of age) to pornography is related to greater involvement in deviant sexual practice, particularly rape. Slightly more than one-third of the child molesters and rapists in this study claimed to have at least occasionally been incited to commit an offense by exposure to pornography. Among the child molesters incited, the study reported that 53 percent of them deliberately used the stimuli of pornography as they prepared to offend...........http://www.protectkids.com... W. L. Marshall, \"The Use of Sexually Explicit Stimuli by Rapists, Child Molesters, ,\" The Journal of Sex Research 25, no.2 (May 1988): 267-88. 3.porn actors same as prostitutes. If you look at the definitions there very similar. If you think about it morally they provide the same services for a fee. Since the porn industry advertises these porn stars,(just as pimps advertise prostitutes)and since the workers are offering sex for money,( just like prostitutes). it ought to be illegal as well. Morally atleast. Also this could be under obscenity witch is not protected in anyway morally. the only difference with porn stars is that there under the camera, have a director,its legal,they sign a contract. This is just legal prostitution. Another point I want to make is that pornography includes all branches of pornography. That means child porn, animal porn, etc.......my opponent needs to defend it. So in my case I have effectively proven,That pornography is more detrimental than good, Allows children to illegally veiw porn due to inadequate age confirmation systems, and lastly that porn actors are the same as prostitutes thus should be treated the same as prostitutes and thus pornography should be illegal.', 'My position is pretty obvious. I will prove that pornography is immoral for unobvious reasons.( atleast i think there unobvious reasons....lol) and should be illegal and that the bad outweighs the good. I hope to have a great debate.']\n",
            "['BOP- My opponent has it as she advocates a chance in the status quo, is an instigator, and is PRO. As she has not specified otherwise I say he has the BOP. --Refutations--My opponents C1:The basis of my opponents argument is it hurts family, and mainly kids through addiction. The argument on who watches the type of video is irrelevant, as if I refute the premise below, then the argument is defeated. The majority of my opponents argument after showing kids watch this stuff (irrelevant), she shows things like it is detrimental to the marriage institution. My opponents only links the cons on a marriage, but does not show the pros and the intermediates. Many people who are really holy holy marriage people may, you know, become curious. But they may think look at this slu*, she does not enjoy her husband. Some people say pornography is good for the sexual imagination, and moderate usage may enhance sex life. Some less committed woman may actually approve of the watching of pornography, as she may be the type that respects the husbands views. Also, porn only hurts the wife if she has a poor self image. If she thinks she has a good one, it should not really effect her. [1]My opponent then contends it is addictive, causes rape, and they may become desensitized. I will first refute the addiction part of it. There is actually a controversy on whether it is addictive or not, whether it is the porn or some other aspect in life. Many contend it is outside arguments, and things that make it hard to even have a sex life that lead the to this hole. So the problem may not be the porn, rather a non sexual spouse. Others say if you treat them like addicts it may be detrimental to the viewer. [2] The basis of my opponents argument is flawed as there is a high controversy on the issue. He then claims they become desensitized. My question is so what? They get bored they can not watch it, or watch worse why does it effect you or the country? Why is it the governments job to intervene? Also, a reason people watch porn is because they may be bored in the first place, not why it exists. So the best way to control it may be handing out free books :P. My opponent then claims it causes rape. I refer you to my arguments in C1.My opponents final argument is it changes the concept of the human brain, yet forgets any porn watching is not sex watching or a sex addiction. Sex requires two individuals procreating, or two individuals just doing their thing. Porn would unlikely effect sex life with education programs showing porn =/= sex. Education, not banning, may be a better way to control the vile insidious substance.---> Sex lifesee above.---> masturbation addiction kinda gross, but this does not hold up unless you show its bad. ---> shamecool. So making it illegal and if they watch it (hard to censor the internet) and throwing them in jail is better for the problem? No, legal porn and throwing them in education programs is better.---> Loner^^My opponents C2: The basis of my opponents full argument is the filters are not good enough. Well my opponent may have just conceded the argument right there. He said the filters, not the porn is the problem. Instead of taking away some creepy dudes fun away, mandate a filter, make current filters stronger. This here would fix all of the problems you listed, without abashment. Abloishment is not needed as you added in the words filter. He then says it makes kids rapist. See my C1.My opponents C3:My opponents argument is faulty even if it is correct, as porn stars CHOOSE to get into the job they are in. He also has to prove it is bad, as when you legalize prostitution it gets safer for them. [3] So making it legal not only helps the people, but makes it safer. And again, they CHOOSE to be there, not the governments business. --Case--C1: Porn reduces crime This argument is logically sound either way, as they spend more times watching this crap then grabbing people into alleys. \"The bottom line on these experiments is, \"More Net access [Porn], less rape.\" A 10 percent increase in Net access yields about a 7.3 percent decrease in reported rapes.\" [4]\"Results from the Czech Republic showed, as seen everywhere else studied (Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sweden, USA), that rape and other sex crimes have not increased following the legalization and wide availability of pornography. In addition, the study found that the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible -- a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan.\"[5] Didn\\'t my opponent say it rose rape and moles rapes, yet I just proved it doesn\\'t without using bsse sources? (my opponent used frc). As I am low on space I must continue. C2: Economy \"The statistics are truly staggering. According to compiled numbers from respected news and research organizations, every second $3,075.64 is being spent on pornography.\" [6]Imagine it though! Banning it would likely be ineffective, but would still constrict this money supply to our economy. Aboloshment would be detrimental. Porn is worth 14 billion per year, that is huge. [7] Banning it woudl likely shrink our economy by 10 billion dollars, and piss off a lot of people. The economy benefits on porn, and banning it is actually counter productive economically. Also I forgot, we could tax it if it was legal ;).C3: 1st amendment the first amdnment-\"protects the right to freedom of religion and freedom of expression from government interference. \"[8]\"Despite popular misunderstanding the right to freedom of the press guaranteed by the first amendment is not very different from the right to freedom of speech. It allows an individual to express themselves through publication and dissemination\" [8]Internet counts as dissemination. [9] With this being said, this now makes it IMPOSSIBLE to ban pornogorphy under the constitution. Now, no matter what arguments in this debate happen if this argument stands I get an auto win. Conclusion: You cannot ban porn, it lowers crime, and it is bneficial to the economy. I think I have proven her arguments wrong or have semi-reufted them. Also to add, my opponent has not fufilled the BOP. Vote CON.http://www.debate.org...', 'I can devils advocate this I accept.', 'Yes, you have the BOP, and I have fulfilled it already, you have not. --First refutation--My opponent mixed the order, but ok. The argument here is they are prostitutes, therefore it should be illegal. My opponent now opens up a huge new debate on the sex laws. Now, the resolution states ought to be illegal, this means this argument too considers the \"ought\" factor. So, my opponent first must prove pornography, and in this argument prostitution should be illegal. Also the majority of his case says this is bad for women. The funny thing is, prostitutes, when legalized, have lower AIDS rates then when it is legal. [1] Now, when we make things illegal it becomes less clean, as we see from the drug war, and it is STILL used. And it would be extremely hard to censor it. The current porn industry has many scans for STD\\'s, one check every 30 days. [2] Now that is illegal, (assume your side prevails in the laws) then the industry WILL form a black market, and make it less safe. My opponents cause now stands defeated here, as the ought in the resolution acts in my favor.My opponent essentially conceded that children watching porn is illegal, which proves my point. It is impossible to ban this stuff, and a ban would to little to lower users, etc. In pakistan, they have a ban on this vile stuff, yet the amount of people watching it within the country is still high. [3] The basis of my opponents argument fails because even if we ban it it just enters a black market making it LESS SAFE, and the same problems with the porn industry live, and get worse (STD\\'s). My opponent then bolds the statement I have not justified my arguments below, which is false. I have explained the benefits of legal porn: Economic and crime wise, then I proved it was impossible to ban via 1st amendment. My opponent must have really not read me saying CASE, which is arguments for porn staying legal. Her bolded statement is false. I think ANY reader can see where my justification is.My opponents next argument is if your interested in intercourse, why not have intercourse. There are many reasons, nagging wives, a refusing wife, you do not want to risk pregnancy again or ever. There are many reasons to have fantasies then procreate with your wive. My opponent also only refutes one of the arguments I presented with the marriage thing. As stated, porn means some things to people, different things to other. [4] So some marriages it will not effect. It also teaches new techniques, discovers your sexuality with your wife, and helps find ways it \"turns you on\", therefore helping you and your spouse. [4] My opponent ONLY refuted ONE of the benefits presented, the it will not effect you if you have a good self image. This is a fact, as if you have confidence you will prevail. His case here is no woman would like a man watching a porn star, the funny thing is some marriages watch it together!! [4] Like: \"With the availability of porn at your fingertips couples using it together is a new phenomenon in many relationships. More and more couples are using pornography to help stimulate their sex life. \" [4]These couples have no problem with this, and my opponents case forgets the upsides to porn in a relationship. --Second-- My opponents argumet here is porn is addictive, \"look as the sources\", and I urge the same. There is actually evidence in that wikipedia article disagreeing with her, and states pornography addiction may not exist. Addiction is a usage of a drug or substance that changes mood, and has adverse effects on the body and mind. [5] Now my opponent has not proven it changes mood at all, just cites an FRC article saying it causes rape. It may not be the porn they are addicted too, but social life and moods make them visit these sites, which implies it is social life, not porn that is causing the so called addiction. [6]My opponents next comparison, again, opens up the debate to prostitution. As I am devils advocating this whole debate, let me argue for that statement too. Prostitution = more things to tax hence more revenues. Also it opens up a new economic market, and as stated lowers AIDS rates from prostitutes, from when they operate illegally, which they DO. My opponent has not proven prostitution \"ought\" to be banned. As this is the case, I win this argument too.My opponent then talks about it shows bestiality, yet he has no facts to prove any of his assertions. Her argument is education and rehab will not prevent rape, although porn already reduces rape numbers, my opponent ha snot proved how rehabilitation and education would not do anything. We can compare this to Portugal, they legalized drugs and rehab the people, it has worked great, and these people are addicted. No reason rehab would fail. My opponents argument then goes people would not have access. I refer to above. Abolishment would not work. --Third--God prostitution is all over this debate. My opponent then claims people would be kidnapped, like they are now. This is funny. Making it illegal causes the kidnaps as they need to get people to do it and convince them the police wont get them. In Nevada, where is is legal in certain areas, this never happens. My opponents argument is a fallacy, when t is sometimes the laws, not the practice that makes the problems. And remember the benefits of prostitution legalization above.__________________________________________________________________________________________________--Crime--My opponent claims my source is faulty, but this is funny as well. It looked at trends, needing to foresee the future is not needed in this case, this means your biased christian source [FRC] is false too as it does not foresee the future. needing to know who rapes is irrelevant, but the overall statistic is needed. We see once porn becomes legal, RAPE RATES DECREASE. \"the incidence of rape in the United States has declined 85% in the past 25 years while access to pornography has become freely available to teenagers and adults [7].\"\"An academic has claimed to RAW STORY that a decline in reported rape of 85% in the past 25 years can be tied to an increase in pornography consumption. \" [8]\"When compared to Disaster Center\\'s figures for forcible rape for the years 1980 and 2000, the four states with the lowest Internet access showed a 53% aggregate per capita increase in rape, while the four states with the highest Internet access showed a 27% decrease in incidence of rape.\"[8]Point proven.--economics--My opponents argument it will be spent elsewhere. That\\'s not how an economy works, you take away an industry the economy collapses. Extend argument. --First amendment-- First, we can only deprive this right if it infringes life liberty or pursuit of happiness. It actually increases all 3. Also the only time they can regulate speech is commerce, if they feel a compelling interest in nuetral speech, or regulation based on the way the message is sent. [9] the argument only works if it hurts people, it does not.My opponent then asks why does the government tax us. This shows little understanding of law. If the state has an interest to do something, as long as its compelling, they are allowed to do anything. There is no interest to break the 1t amendment for porn. My opponent then says it protects speech, not porn. Porn is an expression, 1st amendment protects expression, [10] it is unconstitutional to ban it. My opponents last argument is it is obscene, does it infringe life liberty or pursuit of happiness? No. No effect on life. Increases liberty, freedom of choice. And no effect on happiness, if it is ugly dont watch it. It is protected by the first amendment. Conclusion: 1. pro has not met the BOP2. Porns benefits outweigh the false negatives presented by pro3. VOTE PROarguments - con, BOP not met by pro, and I refuted her argumentseverything else tied or you choose.I enjoyed this debate, literally our of room.http://tinyurl.com...']\n",
            "['Dear Rose212, I am not talking only about America. I am talking about what is happening globally. And in my opinion, low test scores have nothing to do with how governments influence schools with their beliefs. Students still know things, even with the low test scores and the low literacy rates. And if you still believe that schools and government have no relationship between them, then why some researchers show that people with low literacy rate tend to believe easier what is said to them? so, they will believe what they are told without any second thoughts or doubts about what they have heard. About the wars section. Yes, indeed we have wars but each country tries to make its citizens believe that they werent responsible about it. And like i have previously said, Cypriots learn the cypriot side and Turskish people the turkish side without being sure if what they have just learned is true or not. They just believe it because its their country telling something and they learn it from primary education until highschool or until college! So, in order to keep the government up dont they do it from schools?', \"@Rose212 I dont disagree with you. However, dont you think that governments put students learn what they want them too? For example, in history books, each country shows what they want them to learn and believe. For example, Americans learn that america hasnt done any mistakes and dont know the whole story. Another example is with Cyprus. In their history books they learn that Turkish done horrible thing during the war of 74 and Turkish's in their history books show that they did the war just to keep peace and that the turkish people who were at the island were at risk so they came to save them. So what side is the correct one? no one really knows, except from the governments and those who signed different contracts during the war. So each government provides students with the information they want them to know. To sum up, i still believe that schools keep the government alive.\", 'Some people argue that schools are made up to create nations and to keep the governments alive.

I look forward to future debates as well.\", '\"I had no idea that sitting in my car after it stalls on the railroad tracks and letting the train hit me, in not suicide. I only wish the insurance company and the law agreed.\" Well, it\\'s not exactly that simple. The action of allowing the train to hit you in the vast majority of cases essentially takes the away the agency of the train driver. Let me explain further, the train driver often cannot stop in time to prevent the death of the individual. That\\'s why the individual in question would be committing suicide. He is taking advantage of the lack of control a train to end their own life. The only one with free will in the scenario is the individual, as any choice the driver makes will result in the death of person choosing to end their life. Pilate chose to have Jesus executed. Jesus did allow it, but the people who brought him to Pilate, Pilate who ordered the execution, and the people who put him on the cross all had their free will. They could have refused to go any further with the execution of Jesus. Would it have been futile? Yes. Would Jesus have been executed anyway? Definitely.

For example, in the hypothetical scenario where I am a cancer patient and I decide to shoot myself, that would be suicide. If I in a different example, had a friend shoot me instead, my friend\\'s actions would be considered homicide. Jesus essentially gave his permission to the Romans/Jewish leader to have him executed. However, he did not take his own life. His death was and still is considered death by crucifixion. 2. Suicide is a sin in the Christian Bible (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) [19] Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; [20] you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17 NIV) [16] Don\\'t you know that you yourselves are God\\'s temple and that God\\'s Spirit lives in you? [17] If anyone destroys God\\'s temple, God will destroy him; for God&\\'s temple is sacred, and you are that temple. I feel as though these verses make it clear that suicide, the act of one destroying their \"temple\" is considered a sin as demonstrated in Corinthians. Suicide is clearly a sin. If we assume that Jesus foresaw his death, then we must also assume (for the purposes of this debate) that Jesus was the Son of God. Now, the purpose of Jesus\\' death on the cross was the be a perfect, and sinless sacrifice for the world. So, since suicide is a sin and Jesus is sinless, Jesus could not have committed suicide. I await my opponents response.']\n",
            "[\"Jesus had very free will. He very easily could have gotten out of Dodge and avoided his foreseen and predicted death. Whether it was a ticking bomb or a speeding train or a bunch of servants ordered by authorities under strict control He willingly sacrificed Himself for a cause. Certainly a good cause indeed, but a voluntary submission to be killed. I do agree that Jesus would never have committed suicide without a higher purpose. I'm convinced that Jesus committed martyrdom and not conventional suicide. You win the debate. You don't need to explain to me what a train is, it was my story.

If someone allows their self to be killed, like sitting on the railroad tracks, when they could get up and leave, are they in retrospect committing suicide?']\n",

            "['Rebuttal 1: Freedom and Law The 1st point made by my opponent in this contention is the definition of “ban” and the resolution. This is the resolution as proposed by my opponent: Resolved: The US Government should ban guns. My definition of ban is yet to be challenged by my opponent, and I will stand by it. “Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.)” I never specify if this is a total gun ban or not, I use the blanket term guns and I do not specify the type of firearms that would be targeted, and I do not state “all guns” I simply stated “guns.” It would be illogical to think that I would propose an idea such as that given the examples used by both me and my opponent not being complete bans. Australia targeted semi-automatic guns, Britain banned handguns, and other countries that my opponent has brought up have not banned all guns anyway. Thus, if my opponent is truly wanting to debate a full gun ban, then he has not proved legitimate harms from passing the resolution since we both used partial bans in our points. In which case, this debate has devolved into meaningless dribble on both sides. Next, the 2nd amendment is brought up. My opponent states that an English expert stated that the 2nd amendment is an individual one. However, as the said expert explains, the interpretation is purely linguistic and takes into account the exact meaning of the constitution. Next, he cites a YouTube video, under any evidence standard, YouTube videos do not provide information worthy of putting into a case. Remember, video on YouTube can easily be biased in favor of one’s ideology. Also, state constitutions are different based on whether a liberal or conservative majority is in government positions. In places like California, Iowa, and Maryland have no provisions even concerning guns, while certain states allow for the public to be protected from policy that aims to clean up crime (1). My opponent also claims that the newer precedents of the interpretation of the 2nd amendment are somehow more valid simply because they are newer. Remember, the fact that there is such debate over the 2nd amendment’s limits imply that there is grey area where the interpretation of the amendment is concerned. After all, the court has decided other amendments to be limited in some ways as well. For example, in Davis vs. Boheim, the court upheld that defamation of character had to be proved with 4 criteria, but still was a crime. The founding fathers could not have determined the influx of gun crime in the US and certainly would not know that superior gun technology would exist to the point that automatic and semi-automatic weapon fire would exist, given the weapon of choice in the past to be muskets and flint lock pistols. Next, he attempts to attack my point about the fact that over a million children live in a household where a weapon is readily available. He brings up child negligence laws, which he claims that since the laws designed to prevent children becoming injured or killed and are still not enforced, neither would my ban. First, he conflates two different issues that are not in relation with each-other. There is no child negligence law federally that prevents where parents store the weapon if they have children, meaning that there is nothing to conflate to begin with. Also, I have defined the word “ban” with this in mind and mentioned raising penalties, which would deter the number of people who would break this law. Rebuttal 2: Suicides My opponent basically concedes to my suicide point by saying it is someone’s right to do so, and furthers this by claiming suicide to be a victimless crime. This is not the case, many people are effected by the decision to ends one’s life, including family members, friends etc. Not only this, but saving any life is inherently a benefit to everyone, as we affirm the right that people own to life. If suicide is to be legal anyway, it should be administered by a doctor, thus preventing trauma from other family members and friends. Next, he claims that many criminals are scared off from other people owning weapons. He has yet to refute my Boston University example and simply scoffed when I showed the fact that the CDC is not able to show benefits of gun control. Also, regardless of what the executive branch’s opinion is in this matter, it should be mentioned that at the time, and possibly even now, the legislative branch, where actual law gets passed is split on the issue. Also, my opponent claims that the Australia model will not work in America due to different demographics and beliefs held between the two nations. However, the Australian party in charge of the legislative branch equivalent was conservative, many not favoring the NFA (3). My opponent seems to think that by enacting any gun ban, we would guarantee that public violence would spark. The fact that it did not in any other country, despite conservative notions and outrage, points in the opposite direction. My opponent states that Australia’s homicide rate did not lower, even though he never directly states why. I have offered stats to the contrary. His statistic claimed that other crimes not associated with guns increased. Yet, he has yet to link the ban with higher rates of other crime. Also, need I remind you that Australia had significantly lower crime rates as a result? I have already shown you the graph in last round and the fact that homicide and suicide were lowered significantly (4). Also, the fact that crime decrease in Australia despite many people owning guns means that we would still have a decrease in crime, and death as a result. My opponent mentions the fact that there is no protection from tyranny. This is despite the fact that I have not advocated for a total ban on guns, meaning that people can still own some types of firearms, just not certain ones such as automatic and semi-automatic weapons. Also, assuming that the people of another country come and try to kill us, we would still have superior military forces, technology, and ability. The likeliness of anyone attacking us is slim at best to begin with, and I can assure you that people who have not been trained in combat scenarios will not even put up a fight against other country’s military, making this point non-unique, because in the event that my opponent proposes, there is little likeliness of survival for any civilian. The next example my opponent uses is the fact that gun control can be used to oppress people, using the example of slaves being oppressed by these laws from revolting. This is a straw-man fallacy, since the debate is about the general welfare of the people, and the fact that it “was” used to suppress people does not mean that the moment we pass gun control, the entire government starts oppressing its citizens. Rebuttal 3: Economy Again, the economy can be fixed, but the lives of the people is priceless. Since my opponent makes no argument against the welfare of the people framework, his argument does not stand. May it also be known that the manufacturing of all goods are being outsourced as we speak, meaning that in a few years, this will not even matter as other countries or robots manufacture the guns. Conclusion With the lives of the people at stake, and the obvious coming to light, one must vote in the affirmation. Good luck to my opponent as we approach the end of the debate. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...)', 'Rebuttal 1: 2nd amendment The 2nd amendment does not guarantee the right to own weapons without restriction. The Cornell Legal Dictionary states the exact language of the 2nd amendment as such: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" (1) An individual does not have the right to own a firearm without restriction. In fact, a Supreme Court case has established that the 2nd amendment is fluid in interpretation. The case in question is the United States vs. Miller case in 1934 which dealt with the regulation of a sawed-off shotgun under the National Firearms Act of the 1930s and established the original intent of the 2nd amendment was to establish militias to counter oppression, and that since the sawed-off shotgun had any reasonable relationship with a well-regulated militia, the 2nd amendment did not protect it (1). While other precedents later established the contrary, the fact that the original intent of the 2nd amendment was considered to be for the purposes of a militia still continues. Not only this, but there have been gun bans before other precedents have been set. For instance, there have been Assault Weapons Bans and provisions in the early 1990s that was not struck down as constitutional. However, if you really want a look at how people interpret the 2nd amendment, we need to look at popular opinion. According to a poll conducted by YouGov and the Huffington Post, over 80% of people support not allowing people to purchase guns if they are on the terrorist watch list (2). This, in itself is a gun ban, which falls under the resolution regardless of the type of weapon, or person purchasing said weapon. Thus resolution states “a” gun ban, not a “total gun ban” in which all weapons are confiscated or outlawed. Thus, the second amendment does not apply in this debate. Remember, we are talking about the general welfare of the people, which affirming the right to life does, while the second amendment has only led to people protecting the right of those to shoot others, the right to life is universally upheld by everyone and is more ingrained into society than the 2nd amendment. My opponent also claims that the majority of the gun owners in the US do not actually commit crimes or fall victim to gun accidents. I would be inclined to agree were it not for my framework. My framework states that we only value the promotion of the general welfare, and not the scope of the people affected. Even if I can only prove that the number of accidental shootings decreased, or the crime decreased is minimal, I still win based on the fact that the general welfare of the people is better off. Rebuttal 2: Violent crime rate My opponent is mistaken significantly. Not only have I proven the fact that there has been a notable decrease in homicide and suicide with or without guns used by 1.4% per annum (3), but he cites a questionable statistic that misses the point. My opponent claims that the prevalence of other crimes increased, but has yet to link it to the gun ban. Since the link is never made, the entire statistic is meaningless. This is especially true since the author of the NCPA article was Howard Nemerov, someone unknown to the world of academic publishing and posts articles to the website freerepublic.com, leading me to believe that at best, this source is questionable. I will address the argument that the rate of crime returned to pre-ban rates with a graph modeling the actual decrease in crime. We can look toward the evidence compiled from New York Times for this, from a previously used statistic (4). Also, there have been no mass shootings thus far in Australia since the gun ban, saving precious lives. Next, my opponent brings up Kennesaw, Georgia’s law that mandates gun ownership which purportedly stopped the city from devolving into the “wild, wild, west.” This is likely to occur anyway given the demographics and population of the city. City-Data reports a population of under 50,000 people and an average income about $10,000 higher than the rest of the state (5). Compare this to the millions living in Houston, New York, San Diego, and Philadelphia (6). The cities that are more susceptible to gun violence are in places where there are plenty of people, and poverty. This is because people look toward crime as a means of escape and possibly funding if they are part of organized crime, and that there are more people to shoot at with a greater risk of conflict when people are in close proximity. Regardless, the Kennesaw example simply does not work, and is clearly not representative of all of America. My opponent then calls to action through the policy of allowing teachers, principals, and other school officials to carry weapons. There is a major problem with this argument, and that one is human error. The American Journal of Epidemiology finds significant correlations between owning a firearm and gun violence in the form of homicide and suicide (7). It is not apparent that a teacher, principal, or whatever school official would not just leave the weapon out in the open. I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon, which could mean access to said firearm and resulting in mass shootings as well as gun accidents (8). Ultimately, the gun ban proposal in Australia is shown to have worked by my evidence provided. Also, the counter-proposal to the gun ban could lead to more harm and more of a threat to the general welfare of the people. Rebuttal 3: Defense My opponent first states that guns are used to prevent tyrannical government takeovers, animals that would attack people, and criminals. Later, he cites a report claiming a significant deterrent between gun ownership and deterrence of crime. Live-Science reports that Boston University conducted a similar study and found evidence correlating higher homicide rates and gun ownership (9). Not only this, but I have already linked owning a weapon with the higher chance of ending up dead due to homicide or suicide as reported from the American Journal of Epidemiology (7). Not only this, but the study was conducted in 1995, during a federal weapons ban and higher incarceration rates. In other words, the times were different, and since the criminals were unaware of who had a gun due to said ban, the fear of a gun would be irrational. My opponent also brings up a poll of inmates which, in his own statistic, proves to be unreliable as the lead of the study restricted the sample size to those who had begun their sentences in 1979 or have been out of jail since then (10). It goes without saying that the fact that people were still scared of guns under my opponents estimate during the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban that proves despite what restrictions we place on guns; people will still be frightened as they are not rational actors. Not only this, but lowered crime rates as shown by Australia would suggest less of a need to use guns as self-defense as opposed to a knife or any other weapon. The CDC report is not shocking in its results given the fact that, as reported by LA Times, the CDC for the past 20 years have been forbidden from advocating or spending money to promote gun control meaning that the research had to be stopped, despite its truth or fallacious value (11). This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently. In other words, my offensive arguments hold water in today’s debate, meaning an affirmative vote is necessary. Rebuttal 4: Economy First, there are other industries where manufacturing other goods besides guns can occur. Also, given the lives lost by not affirming this resolution, this impact is not as important. I even state in my framework that the economy can be fixed, but once a life is lost, it can’t be brought back. Rebuttal 5: Violence would ensue I never argued for a total gun ban, as this was not part of the resolution. I have only addressed Australia’s model, which was not a complete ban either. I have already shown you that there is support for a ban on firearms sold to those on the terrorist watch list, which would be a gun ban as well, with over 80% of people in favor of the idea (2). In other words, there is no guaranteed violent crime outbreak from NRA supporters. There would be outrage by some, as shown by the fact that conservative officials were in charge of the NFA in Australia, but the saving of people is a bipartisan issue, and I am certain people will see it that way, just like people did after the NFA was passed. Conclusion My burden in this debate is to prove that a gun ban would be beneficial to the people’s general welfare, as stated in the framework of the debate which my opponent has yet to challenge. Thus, this is a victory for the affirmation. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3. (http://tinyurl.com...) 4. (http://tinyurl.com...) 5. (http://tinyurl.com...) 6.

Also, it is imperative that definitions account for the specific language in the resolution. Ban: Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.) Guns: Firearms. Framework We need weigh the impact of the general welfare of the people in today’s debate higher than any other impact. This is due to the fact that lives are priceless and the prevailing theories about debates such as this is that the number of people who are harmed by guns are a much bigger problem than the economy, which can always be fixed. Thus, if I can prove that the gun ban promotes the general welfare of the people, then the judges should feel comfortable to vote in my favor, and vice-versa for my opponent. Contention 1: Gun bans have been successful in reducing gun violence There is significant evidence pointing toward national gun bans to be the best way to reduce gun violence and crime. To see this, we turn toward Australia, the nation that has single-handedly decimated the gun violence in their own nation. This was accomplished by passing the National Firearms Agreement of 1996 as a reaction to the brutal massacre at a Tasmanian Seaside Resort (1). Harvard in 2007 reported that the result was that within 7 years of the installment of the sweeping policy that outlawed the majority of firearms and raised penalties for owning said weapons, the firearm suicide rate was cut in half from over 2/100,000 to 1.1/100,000 (1). This created a major dip in the total suicide rate not relating to firearms, as shown by the Guardian in June of 2016 when it states that the 1996 reforms resulted in the rising rate of suicides non-firearm suicides and homicides from 2.1% a year to 1.4% decline, which researchers attribute to the fact that people were not looking toward other methods of suicide or homicide (2). As previously mentioned, the rate of homicides also decreased significantly after the reforms were passed. The New York Times reports that despite the growing population of Australia, and the conservative nature of the government, these reforms did pass and resulted in the homicide rate decreasing by 50% in the decade after installment and has been on the decline since (3). Again, the rate of total homicide was shown to decrease as well, as criminals did not switch to another weapon to commit the crime they would have intended to have done (3). This can be attributed to the fact that guns are the most available type of weapon with a significant chance to inflict mortal damage. A knife is unwieldy and does not result in the same mortality rate as guns. The Annals of Emergency Medicine Journal in a 2003 report examined 4,122 patients and found that of those who were shot, 1/3 of them died, while only 7.7% died from knife wounds (4). It is harder to approach someone and aim for a vital organ without the victim knowing than it is to simply aim for a vital organ of said victim with a weapon. Given the fact that the majority of the guns used in homicides today are handguns, (as compiled from FBI data,) we can most definitely see that weapons which are small and fit in one’s hand are hard to see from the perspective of an unsuspecting victim (5). By decreasing the murder rate, we establish more peace in cities and suburbs that were fraught with gun violence beforehand, thus protecting the safety of the people and promoting the general welfare. We provide a safe environment for people to live in which ultimately means we protect their right to life without due process, as the taking of a life is in violation of this, which is again, promoting the general welfare of the people. Thus, one must cast a vote in the affirmation. Contention 2: Prevent gun accidents from occurring as well as lapses in judgement Gun accidents are prevalent in the status quo, much to the ire of many people. What is more disturbing is who fall victim in these gun accidents. Slate magazine quoted David Hemmingway in his book Private Guns, Public Health of the University of Michigan Press in 2006 which states that children are nine times more likely to die by gun accident in the US than any other nation in the developed world (6). These are preventable circumstances and should never occur as the children are our future educators, lawyers, and basically our entire job force. Despite the fact that there are training methods for children to prevent accidents like these from occurring, there is significant evidence to the contrary. Hardy MS of the Eckerd College in St. Petersburg FL in a report showed that out of 34 children aged 4-7, even after given the safety program, over 50% of them actually played with a firearm when given an opportunity to do so (7). With over 1 million children living in a household where a firearm is unlocked and not put away, or loaded according to the International Business Times in January of 2016, we can see that the current gun culture has ruined many people’s lives (8). However, this brings us to the question, of whether there is a safe way to store a firearm. The answer is a resounding no. The American Journal of Epidemiology found correlations between owning a firearm and increased chance of homicide, and suicide. Specifically speaking, nearly ¾ of suicide victims lived in a household with a gun, which is the same for 42% of homicide victims (9). What is more disturbing is the fact that a huge portion of the homicides were attributed to family disagreements, making up over 30% of homicides (9). People are simply not rational to be able to be under the stress of society, their job, their family, and their own hopes to own a weapon and assume that they will use it correctly. This is especially true if we look at American Medical News which reports in 2010 that there are about 15 million adults with depression in a given year, many of whom will not receive treatment (10). In fact, a 201 Live-science article reports that half of the depressed population does not get the treatment they need (11). This certainly has a correlation with the suicide rate and shows that Americans simply cannot own weapons in the way we want to in the status quo with millions of guns in circulation. In other words, we prevent the people who need psychological help from committing suicide while providing for the welfare of children and guaranteeing that the American people are not as likely to die from their own weapons. Thus, I am upholding the framework which states that we care about the people that will be effected by the resolution, ultimately leading to an obvious vote in the affirmation. Contention 3: Upholding life It is the sworn duty of the government to uphold the and protect the rights of the people so they do not become slaves to an oppressive and abusive government. By affirming, we do this because we set a precedent for upholding the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as outlined by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence (12). These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, and that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they are represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, and the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law and has the right to life, liberty, and property. These ideas are based on the philosophy of John Locke, an enlightenment figure who inspired the creation of our government (13). This leads us to realize that by not holding up the job of the government, we are suppressing the people’s rights by allowing copious gun violence to continue and thus violating their autonomous right to life without due process of law. In this way, the US has an obligation to fix this problem posthaste and stop the violation of rights in the US, thus promoting the general welfare by giving people what they were promised by the political documents that established our country. Conclusion We need to affirm the resolution and save lives that would be lost without our ability to counter the threat. By doing so we prevent homicides, suicides, accidents, lapses of judgement, and to protect the rights of the American people from further encroachment. I have shown that under the affirmative world, the general welfare is upheld and thus, fulfilling my burden of proof, thank you. Sources 1. (http://tinyurl.com...) 2. (http://tinyurl.com...) 3.

            "['Ban: Confiscate and outlaw, while placing penalties on owning said product, (in this case, guns.) Freedom & Law The confiscation, outlawing, & penalization of the ownership of guns. That is what your definition presented means. That means confiscating people of their weapons, making it illegal to own one, & if anyone that slipped through the cracks & caught later then they will be charged with a crime. The resolution is the US should ban guns, not the US government should ban certain people of having guns. As you also stated in your previous round \"the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away,\" The 2nd amendment is an individual right, an expert on the English language [1] [2] [3] as well as a much newer Supreme Court cases states it to be the case. [4] [5] State constitutions calling it as such. [6] The meaning come even more clear when you also look at the intent of the Founders. Essentially an overturned court case hold no importance at all. Even if it did, assault weapons most definitely would fall under such arguments and therefore shouldn\\'t result in banning them. However this argument regards all guns. \"And that the said Constitution be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the Press, or the rights of Conscience; or to prevent the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\" \" Samuel Adams. [7] In order for the government to deny everyone\\'s right to bear arms, they can\\'t make the case of the \\'greater good of the general welfare\\', they must make the case for each individual has committed a crime grave enough to warrant that person\\'s right be restricted for the \\'greater good\\', cause due process. This can\\'t be done for 99.99% majority hasn\\'t committed a crime \"I already brought up the fact that over 1 million children live in a home with an unlocked or loaded weapon,\" I\\'ve already brought up laws already established that penalizes negligence & child endangerment, if that law can\\'t be enforced with only 2 million guilty. There is no way humanly possible to enforce a law on 100-150 million people whom are against such a thing and has already act in defiance of such things. Estimated crime with the use of a gun is at 500,000, the number of cases in defense of a crime is considerably more. Since there already laws established under due process to restrict people convicted of a crime grave enough to warrant a restriction. There are not among the debate like the 10s of millions innocent who are accident, homicide, or suicide free, that would be affected by the definition presented. A person convicted of a crime results in their rights be restricted, not everyone\\'s right. That is due process So again from the aspect of freedom & legality, this argument is done. Suicides Suicide is a victim less \\'crime\\', ultimately the peoples\\' right to do so. A person has a right to their own, hence their right to end it if they wish. Therefore, the act of voluntarily taking ones own life as a reason to remove the vast majority of the peoples\\' right to defend theirs should be dropped & ignored. In my last round I showed that a large % of criminals was scared off before completion of a crime & even prevented a crime from taking place. This mindset for anyone that values their self preservation will exist anywhere in the world, including Australia. After the gun ban in Australia, more people became victims cause they, the criminals, were emboldened, less afraid of their life being taken. From pro\\'s source \"It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States.\" Why? Cause the American people in vast numbers refuse to follow suit with such things as buybacks & registering. The mindset of Australians & Americans are different. There is historic evidence that Americans won\\'t rid themselves the right to bear arms cause a fraction of 1% of the population use their gun illegally & irresponsibly. You think the defiance would cease in the face of forced confiscation? That\\'s wishful thinking. \"This proves that the CDC is basically required to promote the gun owning population, or suffer from lawsuits if their data proves differently.\" Wild assertion, if that was the case, the US government, whom is actively bent on gun control, wouldn\\'t have funded it. My opponents attempt to rebut the facts that despite predictions of Kennesaw becoming a war zone after the law passed didn\\'t come to light. Crime rates reduced across the board after the law was passed, just as crime rates increased in other parts of the the US & world following bans including Australia. The only difference in crime rates before and after the ban in Australia, UK, Jamaica, ext was the ban, [8] so logic dictates that gun ownership is a major factor in the crime rates. Mexico, strict gun control is in a major war with their armed citizens whom are possession of them. [8] The United Kingdom, strict gun laws, regarded my dangerous nation in Europe, worse then the United States. [8] Gun ownership is considered an important crime deterrent. The police force in the United States doesn\\'t prevent crime, they just catch the criminals that commit the crime. Officers arrive after the fact, people must be able to protect themselves when those seconds matter then report the crime afterwards. There are 100s 1000s of animal attacks a year, millions of criminals committing crimes,without a gun every year, government abuse, I\\'ve seen in person, and increase risk of invasion. America\\'s superpower status is waning, China status of becoming a thing, as well as Russia. Tensions rising in world, America\\'s natural defenses of distance and geographic position is null in modern times. It may not happen within the nest 50 years but America wasn\\'t always the most powerful & its not logical to assume that we will away be most powerful. The right to bear arms was also established so that a foreign nation can\\'t invade & subject us to the types of harshness that the Nazis placed on those lands they occupied as well as against their own people. Or Japan\\'s Nanking Rape where national armies abandon the city leaving the people there with no means of defense. America is not immune to tyranny or invasion, the British ruled, they were pushed out but slavery existed, then gun control measures existed to prevent blacks from rising up and dealing with this tyranny. [9] The economic toll on America & whole states would be negatively affected. 300,000+ people would take a hit which can itself result in a desperate act of criminal activity. The voters need to place the affects of banning or not banning on a set of scales. This isn\\'t just a save lives measure cause there are aspects of American life that will be affected. Therefore any legit discussion involves all that would be involved. The people positively affected of gun ownership & people affected negatively. Looking at the facts, you\\'ll see that the positively affected outweighs the negative. The rights of 318 million Americans would be violated, cause of 500,000-1 million whom abuse their right. The former outweighs this here. Gun ownership is undeniably a crime deterrent, criminals will be criminals, removing the innocence ability to use the most efficient means of defense will result in increase crime. This will not protect the \\'general welfare\\' of the people. The economic toll on the US economy that is already $19 trillion in debt would severely hurt our ability to get out of debt faster, our already unemployment problem would get much worse. And peoples\\' ability to provide for their loved ones being negatively affected would result in desperate measure, not in the best interest of the United States or the general welfare of the people. The consequence of a government program to forcibly confiscate weapons from Americans would result in a vast defiance from the people. People would refuse to surrender their arms, as their historic counterparts had done in the past, & any attempt to put the people & the government into at odd in such a situation would, highly likely, result in the death of Americans both citizen & law enforcement in government. This is again, not in the best interest of the US government or the general welfare. [1] http://articles.latimes.com... [2] http://www.constitution.org... [3] [4] https://en.wikipedia.org...

[10] [11]', 'Freedom \"These principles are ingrained in American culture as the unalienable rights that all people are entitled to, & that all threats to those rights are, by nature, not in the best nature of the US. In fact, these are such American ideals that they\\'re represented in the constitution by the Due Process clause in the constitution, meaning that everyone has these unalienable rights unless proven guilty of a crime worthy of having those rights taken away, & the 14th amendment which repeated the fact that everyone is equal under the law & has the right to life, liberty, & property. \" That is essentially my argument based on the rights of the people. Americans have a right to life, liberty, & property + pursuit of happiness. The government is constructed & its purpose is to protect those rights, among them, the 2nd amendment. Americans have a right to use their property, in this case guns, to protect their life, liberties, property, & pursuit of happiness. It is estimated that 1/3 to even 1/2 of the population own guns, that is 100-150 million people. [1] There is around 33,600 deaths by guns annually, includes accident, negligent, murder, & suicides. [2] That means that .0003% of the population did something resulting in a life taken, that also means that 99.9997% was accident free, no suicide or homicides. Legally, the other 99-149 million+ gun owners shall be free & the government has 0 reason to attempt to deny them of that right based on due process. Cause they have not committed a crime to warrant an arrest, placed on trail, & certainly not found guilty of trail by a jury of their peers. Furthermore, 90% of the people oppose a complete ban and confiscation. [3] So, from a legal & a freedom aspect, there should not be a gun ban. Gun bans don\\'t work Comparing pre & post gun ban crime rates for the UK, Ireland, Jamaica, & Australia, it tells you that the murder rates increased or was similar to pre gun ban. [4] [5] However, other crimes did indeed increase, the UK is considered the most dangerous nation in Europe, worse than the US & South Africa. [6] However, there is a law in Kennesaw GA, that requires heads of households to own a gun & crime rates have decreased, resulting in a murder free environment for 25 years, despite predictions that that American county would become the wild west. [7] Whereas, other counties enacting opposite laws have seen increases in crime rates. [8] Lets look at the most painfully obvious proof that gun ban doesn\\'t work... At our schools. The law abiding Americans accept this obviously proven mistake at great cost to, as you said, America\\'s future. Instead of allowing responsible people, I\\'m sure we agree that most teachers are responsible, whom owns a firearm to conceal carry, or the principle, or someone there to have access to their gun to defend the school against a potential intruders. Defense There are a multitude of potential threats the American people face. Animal attacks in the 100s of 1000s for just dogs [9], criminals, invasion, & tyrannical government. These threats are real, a ban & confiscation of firearms would result in much larger number of potential fatalities against animals, criminals would be embolden by their victims reduced chances, invasion of the United States could forget about strategic planning for the stiff resistance of the American people thanks to a ban, & the people would be forced to live under a government that controls the monopoly of force which is a very dangerous gamble to take. A famous quote comes to mind when I write this, \"Those that give up liberty for temporary safety will lose both & deserve neither\" Now for a comparison between legal defense gun uses vs illegal gun uses in crime. \" A 1995 study in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology based upon a 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone \"almost certainly would have been killed\" if they \"had not used a gun for protection.\" Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 162,000 such incidents per year. This figure excludes all \"military service, police work, or work as a security guard. \" [10] The estimated number of times guns are used in defense against a criminal range in the low 100,000-millions. Report from the CDC puts the number of times Americans used a gun to frighten an intruder away at about 500,000. [10] The Journal of Criminal Law & Criminology estimates that the number of times guns are used in defense is over 1 million. [10] A 1982 survey of felons in prison concluded that 34% was scared off from a gun owner, 40% didn\\'t commit a crime out of a belief that the victim was in possession of gun, & 69% of them knew someone else that were scared off with a gun. [10] The lowest estimates of occasions that Americans use guns in defense is multiple times higher than they are used to murder. Average estimates are about the same number of times guns are used illegally, high estimates rivals or surpasses violent crimes. The CDC also concluded that gun ownership is an important crime deterrent. [11] Bad for the economy A ban on guns would result in a serious problem for the economy, there are over 155,000 workers that are good paying jobs in that industry. Even more workers that revolves around that industry. Those businesses provide near $7 billion in taxes, & near $50 billion to the economy. A ban would cause those people their jobs, assuming they have a families it easily affects 310,000 people not counting real possibility that they have children. [12] Entire states are dependent on the gun industries, the gun industry employs more people then GM. [13] To put it in a little perspective, America\\'s gun industries, if they were a nation, would rank around 82nd wealthiest nation in the world, there are 173 nations. [14] So the gun industry provides America with more money than half of the world\\'s nations can provide itself. Violence would ensue The American reaction towards a call of confiscation would be negative to say the least. As I said earlier in this round, 90% of Americans oppose a total gun ban & any attempt to confiscate them. A large % of Americans refuse to register their weapons. [15] [16] The last time authorities went on a hell bent mission of gun confiscation resulted in the \\'shot hear round the world\\' [17], I don\\'t imagine the reactions of freedom loving people in the United States would respond much differently. The people of the United States having been born & raised understanding that the 2nd amendment is the ultimate line of defense against tyranny, & knowing that when seconds truly matter, cops are minutes away. Americans will not quietly surrender what is considered the most important right the American people have. [1] http://bearingarms.com... [2] http://www.cdc.gov...

            "['Thank you for accepting. As a reminder, please do not read this argument until round 2 is over. The positive effects of Christianity are listed below: Christianity is an advocate of human rights. In the Roman empire, infanticide was common, and it was legal to kill a child. [1] Constantine, the first Christian Roman emperor, was the one to finally outlaw it. [2] Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery. According to historian Glenn Sunshine, \"Christians were the first people in history to oppose slavery systematically. Early Christians purchased slaves in the markets simply to set them free.\" [3] In addition, two thirds of the American abolition society in 1835 were Christian ministers. [4] Martin Luther King Jr. was also a Christian minister, and he is a great example of a human rights supporter. [5] Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates. Christianity has been a leader in education because Bible literacy was so important to Christians. The first law to require education of citizens was passed by American Puritans in Massachusetts. [6] All but one of the first 123 American colleges were Christian institutions. The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible. The idea that all men are created equal is a biblical doctrine. [8] The notion of God\\'s authority is part of the Declaration of Independence and all 50 state constitutions. The preamble of the declaration states, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR with certain unalienable rights...\". Christianity helped to make advancements in science. Many of the founders of modern science were Christians, such as Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, and Louis Pasteur.

When you say \"One nation, under God\" you are not expressing your faith; you are recognizing the Christian origins of the United States. If God does not exist, then the nation was still created under the idea of God. Abraham Lincoln was an atheist. [2] False Hope Using the hashtag #PrayforParis does not create false hope. It makes the people feel better by showing that you care for them. In a situation like that there isn\\'t anything else you can do. Misunderstandings I see even more midunderstandings. Even though you were Catholic, you apparently were ignorant of your religion. 1. The Bible is not what God says. It was not written by God, nor did God teach all of its content. [3] 2. Christianity teaches that if you sin and don\\'t repent, you go to hell, not just if you sin. 3. Thinking that someone is in hell is not false hope, or any hope for that matter. 4. The Old Testament is not considered to be infallible by Christianity. You have contradicted that statement but you have not disproved it. 5. I am not prejudiced against those who are not Christians. I know some atheists who are good people, but I know even more atheists who are not, and the Christians I know are almost all good people. The arguments you claim that I did not respond to All the effects are either one of the arguments I already responded to or something like abortion where the argument only works if you can prove that abortion is not bad. I dismiss all of those arguments unless you can find evidence. I also never agreed that the offerings caused hardship to families, hurt scientific growth, and took away from others.

Literacy/Science I already negated your argument about the dark ages. Declaration/Constitution I also negated that argument. Human Rights I can see a lot of misunderstandings on your part. I will list corrections to them below: 1. The Bible does not have to state that something is wrong in order for Christianity to teach that it is wrong. The Bible is not the \"book of rules\" for Christianity. Christians use the teaching of Jesus to determine what is right or wrong. [1] 2. People are not condemned to hell for sinning. People are condemned to hell for knowing and hating God. Many Christians even believe in Empty Hell Theory. [2] 3. The Old Testament is not considered to be infallible by Christianity. It contains Jewish teachings; Christians only use it as a source for the history of the Israelites, prophecies, Psalms, and some stories with good morals. The books of Exodus and Hosea are not Christian doctrine and are not entirely relevant to Christian beliefs. [3] 4. Two thirds is a lot. Most Americans in 1835 were not Christian ministers, so if most of an organization consists of Christian ministers, Christianity very likely has something to do with it. 5. I never said nor implied that Christianity automatically makes someone a good person, or that a non-Christian can\\'t be good; I actually said that Christianity makes someone more likely to be a good person. 6. Saying that atheists can be good is not relevant to the debate. Christianity and atheism both have positive effects; however, this particular debate is about Christianity. More Evidence Do some research on the following people and you will see how their Christianity influenced them to help society and the world: Mother Teresa, Gregor Mendel, George Mueller, William Wilberforce, William Penn, Boethius, Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Harriet Beecher Stowe, J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis. Those people in addition to the people mentioned in previous arguments (MLK, Rene Descartes, Isaac Newton, Blaise Pascal, and Louis Pasteur) make up 16 positive effects.

The Middle Ages produced classic literature such as \"Beowolf\" and \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", great architecture such as the many castles and cathedrals, and art such as stained glass windows that rival modern art. The Renaissance depended on the science and philosophy of what was apparently \"the dark ages\". Modern philosophy is built upon the work of medieval philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, who was a devout Catholic monk educated at a Catholic university. In fact, the first universities were created by Catholics who valued education. Historians have even found that \"the Renaissance\" was improperly named; there were in fact three other ones on the Middle Ages. [1] I\\'m not even going to respond to that inaccurate picture you linked from a highly biased, unreliable, random blog. Wars As you have said, many Christians have gotten themselves killed for their faith. That is a lot like soldiers dying for our country. Our country has problems, many of its people die unnecessarily, but it is still a good thing. I and many other people are proud to be American despite the country\\'s corrupt laws and politicians, because it is still a young country and it is still trying to help people. The same could be said of Christianity. It has done bad, but it is trying to do good. That was an interesting link you posted. Let me respond to each part separately. Ancient Pagans Before you say that Christians are bad for killing pagans, first consider what the pagans did. They burned children alive as sacrifice, they allowed slaves to be mistreated, they dehumanized women and made them slaves of their husbands, they raped children, they killed Christians (that was probably their main motivation for killing pagans), and many other things. Being a pagan was rightfully seen as equivalent to being a murderer, a rapist, and a slave trader. [2] Mission Since you only showed two examples here, that shows how rare Christian corruption is. Remember what I said about wars. Crusades This was a war, so of course people died, and Christianity is not to blame. Muslims were oppressing Christians, and the Crusaders rescued them. [3] Atheists and Heretics All the examples here are a few corrupt Christians (although they were not really Christians) going against their religion. Witches This had nothing to do with Christianity. Religious Wars This is yet again Christians protecting Christianity from those who wish to harm it. Jews When Jews were harmed, it was either an unfortunate side effect of a war, a response to Jewish aggression, or a few corrupt bishops acting against their religion. Native peoples All the examples here are used as part of a huge cherry-picking fallacy. Many people believed that Native Americans were violent savages because many of them were, and stereotypes formed because of that. However, he is ignoring the Quakers who made peace with them and bought their land at a fair price, the Catholic missionaries who set up shelters and schools for the natives, and the French (most of them Christians) who traded with them and treated them equally with themselves. Extermination camps This had nothing to do with Christians. The so-called Christians who did this broke nearly all ten commandments in the process. This is also another cherry-picking fallacy; he ignores Maximillian Kolbe, a Catholic priest who was arrested for sheltering Jews and later volunteered to starve to death in place of a Jewish man (the Jewish man survived the camp). He also ignores the fact that Hitler discouraged going to church, and had many Christians killed for opposing him. I could go on and on things like this if I only had the time. Now I will respond to your last arguments: Judgment I am shocked by your ignorance on the subject. Muslims believe in God and we have had an atheist president (Abraham Lincoln). I will ignore everything you say here until you confirm your assumptions. False hope Christians do not think that God will do everything for them. They simply ask for help. Conclusion So far, you have found one negative effect of Christianity (radicals), while I have found four. [1] http://www.independent.co.uk... http://listverse.com...

            "['I accept.', \"Wars: The wars were an effect of christianity, as people killed for their religion. Since christianity was their motive, that means Christianity is the reason they committed the killing, therefore making it an effect. Witches: People were hung by the judges of the court (who were christians) because witchcraft was seen as an act of the devil. Therefore, Christianity caused the hanging of all those who died in the Salem witch trials. Misunderstandings: Just because you personally know more good christians than atheists, does not mean that's a solid case. You are playing to stereotypes. If someone killed someone you love, would you not hope for them to be punished for it? Sure prison for life and the death penalty would be punishment, but I know a lot of people would want them to burn in hell. But you're saying if they got repent, they'll get a clean slate? That's an injustice in my eyes. The fact they will get to go to heaven after the horrible deed they committed just because they repented, seems very wrong to me. Also, the bible does have God teachings and Gods words in it, written by people who have dealt with God. However, saying God didn't teach all of its content is completely ignorant. False Hope: It is creating False Hope. Their is things we can do, such as donate money, provide help(resources,protection, ect.) to Paris, ect. You never argued against the offering once in any of your arguments. If you did, then I have overlooked it and I apologize, but I have yet to see where you have argued it. It is now up to the voters to decide who made the better case. Good job Pro, and thanks for the intriguing debate.\", 'Thanks for the intriguing argument. I\\'m going to rebut your arguments from Round 3 and 4, so please bear with me if I\\'m jumping from an argument you said one round to one in another. In your argument, you stuck up for the christians actions of war. The killing of people is by no means a positive, and you defending and saying it is dumbfounds me. The lost of any life, no matter the cause or reasoning, is a negative. You also said Christianity had nothing to do with witches. That is a false statement, as you can look at examples such as the infamous Salem Witch Trials. As for my Judgement argument, I shouldn\\'t have said Muslim, but you know what my notion was. Who would you feel to have to stand up every morning and praise something you don\\'t believe in? If that part is what you ask for confirmation, their truly is no need. You should be able to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue. Other than that, I see no other part of that argument that needs confirmation. As far as Abraham Lincoln benign atheist, their is no solid ground for that as many aren\\'t certain what he was. Until you give 100% proof he was atheist, your claim doesn\\'t stand, and mine does. In the false hope argument I stated that not all christians rely on God, but many do. They ask for help, but some rely to the point where they hope for a \"miracle\". I\\'m going to use the Paris attacks to help explain my case. What happened to Paris is completely inhuman. Many people from all around the world have showed their support. A trending hashtag for the last few days has been #PrayforParis. However, when people say this, what are they truly doing? Saying I\\'m praying for you is practically the same as saying I hope everything works out. You are not truly doing anything. By saying you are praying for them, you are relying on God to answer your prayer and to help the people of Paris. But unless you(or anyone else) don\\'t do anything, it won\\'t help them, therefore you have created a false hope. As far as me having misunderstandings, I\\'m afraid I have to disagree. I was a catholic for 16 years, and I thought I had a pretty good understanding of christianity. From what I\\'ve learned, the bible is how we are suppose to live our lives off. It\\'s teaches us about our creator and what he says, and I figured we should live off what he says. As far as not going to hell for sinning, I\\'m almost positive you do. By saying you don\\'t go to hell for sinning, that\\'s saying serial killers go to heaven with their victims. That\\'s ludicrous. Murder is a sin, and if you\\'re saying they don\\'t go to hell for committing sins(no matter how big or small), then what\\'s the point of having it? This would also add to my false hope argument, making the victims Families think the murdered will spend eternity in the depths of hell when actually they get to spend eternity with God. As far as the Old Testament being infallible: If a man murders a family, but is now a \"changed\" man(church going, compassionate, giving, charitable), he\\'s still a murderer. Even though he has changed, the murder and his past stay with him. Therefore, things from the Old Testament christians are trying to forget about are still with their religion. Saying that \"christianity makes someone more likely to be a good person\" is completely prejudice. Just because someone isn\\'t a christian doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t be a good person. By what you said, you\\'re saying atheist and other religions consists of not so good people. Considering you\\'re a christian, then I\\'m going to assume you got your views because of your biased belief, meaning christianity has given you prejudice beliefs, which is a negative. Once again, just because a person is christian and does something good, doesn\\'t mean you can give a positive to christianity, I stated several people who were successful who were atheists. Isaac Newton could have been an atheist and still made the discoveries he made, his religion had no affect in it. In addition, there is 45 more negatives on the site I listed below of my arguments that you completely ignored. Therefore, I would have presented more than one negative claim like you previously stated. http://www.patheos.com... In counting, I have presented atleast 43 negative arguments(I have presented more, but you have rebutted them and it is up to the voters to see if they think it\\'s a negative or not) as you agreed the offerings caused hardship to families, hurt scientific growth, and takes away from others, and then the 40 negatives on the site. Good luck to Pro in his concluding round. http://www.patheos.com...', 'I will rebuttal those claims in the next round, and rebuttal your arguments from the second round this round. Here are my rebuttals to arguments posted by pro in the second round: *Christianity is responsible for high literacy rates and *Christianity helped to make advancements in science Both of these claims are false. The time christianity ushered in greatness and superiority was the Dark ages, where we actually went backwards in advancement and became illiterate. As far as the scientists, their religious beliefs play no affect in their contributions to science, as it would not matter if they were atheist or a different religion. *The principles in the American Declaration of Independence and the U. S. Constitution came from the Bible This just proves my point of how the United States is favoring Christianity and breaking people\\'s first amendment right AND the separation of church and state. *Christianity is an advocate of human rights In your very own words you stated that, \"Christianity was also a large factor in the abolition of slavery\" In the Bible, the most prestigious book in a christians view, talks about owning a slave. If slavery was wrong, the bible would say it is wrong and anyone who did it was condemned to hell. However, it does not, and actually informs us what to do with the slave. Therefore, it does not think slavery is bad, and actually guides us to be better slave owners. Now it is possible some christians set them free, but if they were truly devote christians they would follow what the bible says, and the bible says, Exodus 21:20-21 \"And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money [property]. \" You went on to say how 2/3 of the American Abolition society were Christian ministers. What about the other 1/3 then? Just because you are christian doesn\\'t mean you are automatically a great person. An atheist, Muslim, Jew, Buddist, ect, can be as good and even a better person as a Christian. You also talk about infanticide, and how the Christian Roman emperor finally outlawed it. In the Bible, God talks about slaughtering children. \"The people of Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. They will fall by the sword; their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open. \"(Hosea 13:16) You can find more verses, like God ordering moses to slaughter babies, at this site . http://www.patheos.com... agree.

This time was called the Dark Ages\" -Richard Lederer The Dark Ages referred to the period of time ushered in by the fall of the Western Roman Empire. This took place when the last Western emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed by Odoacer, a barbarian. AD 476 was the time of this event. This era takes on the term \"dark\" due to the backward ways and practices that seemed to prevail during this time. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Despite the religious conflicts, the period of the Dark Ages was seen as an age of faith. Men and women sought after God; some through the staid rituals of the Catholic Church. Intellectuals view religion in any form as, itself, a type of \"darkness.\" These thinkers assert that those who followed religious beliefs lied to themselves, creating a false reality. They were dominated by emotions, not fact. Religion was seen as contrary to rationality and reason, thus the move towards enlightenment -- a move away from \"darkness.\" Science and reason gained ascendancy, progressing steadily during and after the Reformation and Age of Enlightenment. As you can see above, religion hindered are progression in science,literature,math, and other subjects that if we avoided this we could be extremely more advanced than we are today. This link goes to a picture showing the drop in technology during the Dark ages http://3.bp.blogspot.com... 2.Wars While many believe Christianity promoted peace, it actually has brought great damage. Not only has it affected it\\'s followers, with believers and even his disciples being crucified, burned, ect. for believing in Christianity, and even today with 100 millions christians being prosecuted for their faith. It has also impacted other people, as it has brought wars and slaughterings. Tons of examples can be found at this site http://articles.exchristian.net... Also, at this site, http://addictivelists.com... it list 10 biggest religious wars ever fought, and Christianity and its denominations(catholic) are involved with around 5 of them. 3.The offering At church(Atleast for Catholic Churches) they go around asking for offerings(money donations). The church wants you to give 10% of your works pay that week towards the church. Some people aren\\'t wealthy enough to just give 10%, but some will do it anyways. This could lead to a financial burden to the family/individual. Also, the donations do not count as tax deductions, so no benefits go to the donator in that sense. Think about the money donated. If all of that money was donated to a charity how many lives it would impact. Think about if it was given to St.Judes or another organization similar to that, how many lives it would save and help further medicine. Church taking the offering is putting a burden on struggling families and the growth of medicine/well being of others. 4.Judgement Let me ask you, what is the ... Amendment? It\\'s the Freedom of Religion. However, it is no secret we support Christianity. With 77% of our citizens being Christians, it is the most dominant religion by a extravagant margin. Because of this, our nation has put christianity and made it part of our society and government, breaking our amendment and the separation of church and state. They put in our currency and in our Pledge of Alligence. Tell me, how would you feel being a Muslim having to say \"One nation, under God...\"? You would feel like a minority. With everything around you, including your government, supporting a religion, you almost feel obligated and self conscious about your own personal belief, and feeling as if you need to change. This is violating a persons belief and amendment. Also, another demonstration on how Christianity runs our government is how no atheist have been President of the United States. On this poll http://www.gallup.com... it shows how people will less likely vote for an atheist than any other option. An atheist, no matter how good a politician, is less likely get elected, taking away their job opportunities. Christianity is making the land of the free every judgmental. 5.False hope For many, christianity is hope. It\\'s assurance that no matter how tough the times are, things will get better. Yet the harsh reality is, it\\'s uncertain there is a God. And if there is no good, then chances of your situation getting better become more slim. Take, for example, a man who just lost his job. He prays for everything to get better, and for God to help him. He is hopeful as his omnipotent omnibenevolent God will surely help him, yet he is devastated as loses his house. His hope turned into false hope, which led to no hope. For some, they rely too much on this hope, and won\\'t do anything as they feel God will do it for them. Along with that, I found a site listing 40 harmful effects of Christianity http://www.patheos.com... So in total, that is 45 negatives to Christianity.

The presence of a gun can turn a petty or small situation into a lethal one When a teacher needs to diffuse a uncontrollable situation they have to call the school police officer. If they happen to obtain a gun then the teacher may pull a gun on them or the student themself may snatch the gun and use it against a teacher or another student. The school is a gun-free zone for a reason. http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com... (This source is linked to police shootings but can easily be applied to any situation) 2.

Talking can be a greater weapon than a gun If a student or an intruder comes into your classroom pulling your gun will not only endanger you but the children as well in the classroom. Pulling guns on people makes them even more enraged and can lead to a massacre if you aren't the fastest trigger puller.

            "['Nothing more to say.', 'I will pass this round to make things fair.', 'Here is my argument against legalizing Necrophilia: 1. It is Unsanitary This link states that \"To those in close contact with the dead, such as rescue workers, there is a health risk from chronic infectious diseases which those killed may have been suffering from and which spread by direct contact, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C, HIV, enteric intestinal pathogens, tuberculosis, cholera and others\" (https://en.wikipedia.org...). In other words, if getting in close contact does these things then it is dangerous for a person to even consider having sex with a dead person. These diseases could then be further spread when the necrophiliacs encounter with other people. 2. It is Immoral Not only does this disrespect the dead (when they have permission or not), but it is a practice that is highly immoral. Having sex with the dead does absolutely nothing good. It only causes harm to the necrophiliacs mental state and it causes diseases to spread. The only thing it does is satisfy some creeps desire to have sex with a dead course. I can guarantee that the majority of people will not be interested in allowing some creep to have special privileges especially since the practice causes harm to society. 3. If you legalize this for the reasons mentioned you could also legalize pedophilia (https://www.google.com...). Are you aware that there is a movement for pedophiles to have the same rights as homosexuals (http://www.greeleygazette.com...)? These ideas about legalization are so bad that I couldn\\'t have made it up. Your arguments could literally be used to support pedophilia. As long as the children agree to what happens and as long as it is deemed as safe, it should be legal. Don\\'t you understand how messed up your argument is? The line has to be draw somewhere. Most of the time we make decisions on what benefits society. Since Necrophilia and pedophilia only (sort of) benefits some creeps and not the society as a whole, it should not be legal. Refuting your arguments: a. Economic Benefit? You make a huge assumption with this point. You assume that there are enough people out there that want their bodies to be molested by some creep after they die. I can assure you that most people don\\'t want this to happen. The business\\' would fail because the majority of people wouldn\\'t want necrophilia to be legalized. Normal people don\\'t want to have sex with dead people. You also need to provide some evidence that this would benefit the economy. b. Happiness Benefits? This sure wouldn\\'t make me happy. The only people it would make happy are the lunatics that want to have sex with dead people. But legalizing it would cause unhappiness to society since it causes diseases to spread. And furthermore, the governments main focus (if at all) is not on the happiness of the people. Governments have to think of the society as a whole and not just on the very few people out there that want special privileges. You also make the assumption that there will be many people would be willing to pay for such a service.', 'I have a feeling this is going to be a fun one.']\n",
            "['In order to win this debate, I have to prove that necrophilia should be legalized. I do not have to prove that every instance of necrophilia should be legalized, just that it should be under certain circumstances. Outline: Under my plan to legalize necrophilia it will be legal under the following circumstances: 1-Permission was given by either the dead person prior to their death or by their family to be used for sex after they die. 2-The body is preserved, the same way bodies are before burial and thrown out if deemed unusable. (1) Now that has been established, I’ll enter my arguments. C1-Economic Benefits This is simple. The majority of people who would be willing to have their or their family’s corpse for sexual reasons would need some sort of incentive. Incentive wise, this will probably be financial. This means that a business will probably have to be formed dedicated to necrophilia and people would have to pay for it. This will create economic growth, because it will create jobs needed to preserve the body and could be a quite profitable industry. The extent to which this will create economic growth is unknown, but it likely will occur. C2-Happiness Benefits Legalizing necrophilia would increase happiness. If people are willing to pay for necrophilia, it is clearly something they want. Governments obviously want their people to be happy and necrophilia can bring pleasure to people (while not harming anyone). Everyone knows people like sex and necrophilia can be an easy way to get sex, for people who may otherwise have trouble doing so. Plus, many people have sexual fantasies of various types and necrophilia opens up the opportunity for that. However, even if some people don’t understand it, it need not be understood to know it increases happiness for people paying for it. If anyone wishes to pay for something, they deemed it worthwhile. Pretty much everyone values money (to at least some degree), so anyone willing to part with it felt that they would receive something better. Thus, anyone who would pay for necrophilia would see it as worthwhile way to spend their money and believe it is a positive impact and therefore it increases their happiness. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *This argument was pretty short and to the point, but I imagine Con will have a lot to rebut with, so I’ll have more to say in rebuttals and defense.* Source: 1-http://www.afif.asso.fr...', 'Resolution is self-explanatory (necrophilia being sex with a human corpse).

            "['Ok! Thank you for your answer once again. The information seems to be quite interesting. I\\'ve watched some videos about Kristina Golovchenko. Though I believe this case has nothing to do with The Body Positive Movement - Kristina just requires some medical and psychological help. She doesn\\'t even love her body, right? Thus, the case represents a perfect example for my first argument, which was health. Besides, I agree with you that \"there is something in us that needs to be accepted\" though I\\'ve already mentioned it above claiming that \"self-acceptance is a long road.\" Like self-acceptance, tolerance is something that need to be learnt.However, let us go back to the Body Positive Movement. And here goes my third argument, which is FASHION. I explain it below. I will try to be as brief as possible.On the one hand, there are some people who like to show off. On the other hand, there is social trends (such as The Body Positive) that provokes a disruptive social reaction. As a result, people who aim at drawing public attention use these social trends in their own selfish way. For instance, some girls cease shaving their legs and armpits only to post the hairy body parts photos on Instagram etc. People sometimes do stupid things just to show off. The Body Positive Movement here works as an instrument of crime. I do not want to say that showing off is a crime (an instrument of crime is just a figure of speech). Still, we should be careful with such peculiar trends and shouldn\\'t cross the line of prudence unless we want be freaks of course. Besides, people shouldn\\'t follow all the trends blindfold. Fashion changes but a bit of critical thinking is never too much.Considering my third argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'To begin with, thank you for your answer. I find your arguments quite curious. I agree with you that The Body Positive was meant to serve for solely positive goals. Still, as I\\'ve already said above something went wrong. Thus, I can\\'t agree with you completely. So here goes my second argument, which is JUSTIFICATION. I suggest to take a look at the argument, considering two major aspects of each person\\'s life: self-acceptance and self-improvement.Firstly, I insist that self-acceptance is a long road. Even Rome wasn\\'t built in a day therefore it may take you years and years to make the skin you\\'re in better. Self-acceptance is a winding road. It requires direct action including physical exercises, medical intervention, psychological training and so forth. No one disputes that perfection is unreachable. Still, it doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t try. They say practice makes perfect. I say action makes perfect. Self-improvement is a continuous process that shapes our personality, making us stronger and boosting our confidence. Conversely, The Body Positive Movement claiming that \"Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL\" may serve as a justification for inaction.Secondly, there is a well-known fact that some people are lazy, weak or simply indifferent. They simply lack initiative or boldness to take action. Therefore, some Body Positive ideas including your argument \"The <...> movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities.\" may serve as a justification for indifference. Such concept make you calm down, sit down and be happy with what you get. Personally I suppose that people should not stand still. Conversely, I suggest that self-improvement constitutes an essential part of every person\\'s life. Unlike self-acceptance, self-improvement is a road without an end. Seneca once said that Vivere militāre est which meant to live is to struggle. Now let me paraphrase it saying that to live is to develop as self-improvement is a struggle as well. Considering my second argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!', 'Perhaps, many people have heard something about the recent trend - The Body Positive Movement. At first the movement seems to be completely healthy. What could be wrong with accepting your body as it is? Still, the question is not as simple as it may seem. The concept of the Body Positive is often misinterpreted. Such misinterpretations are fatal not only for a single person, but also for a whole society. Therefore I insist that the movement can\\'t be called positive. And here goes my first argument, which is HEALTH.Firstly, you can accept your body as long as it\\'s healthy. I believe there are some things that can\\'t be accepted. Moreover, there are some problems that can\\'t be solved by simple acceptance. For instance, health problems. The thing is that by chance particular health problems affect our appearance, thus causing lack of self-confidence and making the unhealthy person disgusting for other people. To solve the problems person should consult a doctor, which sometimes represent another problem due to psychological and economic factors.Secondly, I\\'m convinced that one can\\'t make himself or herself love his or her body simply saying \"Ok, I accept myself as I am because each body is perfect\" It\\'s a delusion. It\\'s a self-suggestion. It\\'s a placebo. Time spent on worthless declarations and exclamations may negatively affect your condition leading to the health aggravation. On the contrary, to love your body means to respect your body. To respect your body means to take care of your body.Finally, I believe The Body Positive Movement represents a radical reaction to another recent trend which is plastic surgery. While the 2nd variant helps you achieve fake perfection with an operating knife, the 1st one denies perfection as it is. And as a result, it cuts both ways. These two variants only create the illusion of self-confidence. The Body Positive, just as plastic surgery, works for those who refuse to take direct action. Besides, both are unhealthy. People tend to see things in black and white. Why couldn\\'t we see the shades of grey? Or - what is even better - why couldn\\'t we mix them up with more vivid colours?Considering my first argument, I stick to the opinion that The Body Positive is negative and in particular cases even harmful. Thank you for your attention!']\n",

But what about those people who, for example, have burns all over their body, the most terrible form of acne, which can not be eliminated even by the beauticians of Hollywood, or a psychological dependence on food in connection with a child trauma due to rape (for example - Kristina Golovchenko). Sometimes there is something in us that needs to be accepted, because people are not almighty - they are sometimes really powerless.', 'MEDIA makes us believe that there is something wrong with our bodies. After all, companies and organizations gain greatly when women waste millions on diet fads and untouched gym memberships, when those women could save hundreds by being comfortable in their own skin. The body positivity movement is about health, identity and self-respect. Women of any weight, age, race, measurement or proportion can be/are BEAUTIFUL. The appreciation of curves and physical diversity reduces fat-shaming, bulimia, anorexia, depression and bullying among women everywhere, based on the fact that it\"s about acceptance. The body positive movement sets the challenge of getting women to accept themselves and other women on a fundamental level, in spite of \"flaws\" and \"imperfections,\" so that we may embrace and adore those oddities. A great way to talk about what body positivity is, is to talk about what it isn\"t. It isn\"t about eroticizing or sexualizing, nor is it about tolerance\" it\"s about softening the frown of superficiality, and revisiting points in history where women were praised for curvaceousness outside of a subgroup.']\n",

Plane/drone collisions are possible (though not frequent, if existent), and have lately come closer to colliding than other times. [1]However, the Pro argues that drone should be completely and utterly illegal, which I strongly disagree with. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) sets rules and regulations as to who and what are allowed in the big blue sky; and they are seemingly coming closer to an agreement on approving drones above. [2]As the Con, I am arguing that drones should not be illegal in the USA, but rather that the FAA aproves drone use with the given rules and regulations.

Figure 1. UAV Reaper Drone [2] Figure 2. Camera Drone. [3]Because the Pro does not specify which drones, I will argue for them all. Despite what Pro states in his opening thesis, drones can actually be extremely beneficial in many ways.1: Drones aide in saving lives. Immediately after natural disasters in which the damage is not yet determined, drones can be used to easily assess the amount of damage and find out the level of danger, and acts as a safe alternative to sending in first responders.2: Drones help in agricultural management. Farmers can use drones specifically to manage crops and pinponts areas that need special attention. This way saves time by only providing care exactly where needed, and improves crop yield.3: Help safely in architechtural maintenance and inspection. Drones can obviously go places where humans cannot, and can also do it without risking lives. For example, drones would easily help inspect places of infrastructure such as below bridges and high buildings.4: Drones give the media access to places: They can film places never reached before, for news and film production. This can be done easily, efficiently, and safely, thanks to drones.Because of my limited time, I will limit my arguments to those above and wait for the Pro to present his.

You're a lost mind in a simple world. That's why I like debating with you, sir. I always win, because you continuously fail to provide any sources. We are not going to kill 350 million people for the polar bears. It would be roughly the population of the United States and Australia. But if we killed that many people, the United States and Australia would have far less people and we would be worse off because we would have labor shortages, the people would rebel against their government for killing all the depressed people, and the like. There are cheaper, more humane, efficient ways to deal with global warming, like solar, wind, nuclear, and so on. We do not need to kill everybody to stop global warming. Humans are not the problem, the problem is how we produce energy. If you actually cared about global warming, it would be nice. But you don't you just use global warming as a way to express how you hate 95% of all the people on Earth. Actually, though, we could kill all the white supremacists and hate groups. That would help. I ask you, sir, in the comments, to give me just ONE source, one graph or chart which shows that global warming is brought about by the farts of pessimistic people. I doubt you'll be able to.

Many great comedians have low self esteem, that's why they became comedians. Stand up comedy is a kind of mental therapy. Everybody has low self esteem at some point in their lives, we should not have to hide our emotions. When emotions are suppressed, and people only feel happiness, and the happiness is being forced, then that person is not happy. Many people with depression have jobs, stupid, boring jobs, and that's why they're depressed. They're depressed because they're contributing to society. We should change society so people are less depressed. We should make life more fun. Then they wouldn't be depressed anymore. We should allow more pay, shorter work hours, more career diversity. We should make life better for them, not worse. What kind of sick monster ARE you? You said that 350 million people suffer from depression. Killing them would be killing a lot of people. Then more people would be depressed about the people they killed. Sadness is a part of life. We cannot eliminate it. We can only turn our society into a smiling utopia by embracing sadness as a reality. To Hell with your polar bears. Polar bears are not affected by overpopulation, they're affected by CO2 emissions. We need to stop emitting CO2. Then polar bears would be fine. I'm sure some polar bear scientists have depression. And what about the penguins of the walruses? Do you care about them?

Think about it: if the United States and Australia never existed, there would be much more polar bears in today's world. People who are depressed are always paranoid and sad.

            "['Thank you as well for offering the topic - I enjoyed it!', 'My opponent’s argument breaks down at step 2. The Taylor expansion for ln(x) has a radius of convergence of 1, around the point x = 1, such that 0<x<2 (as opposed to 0≤x≤2) as I will show below, meaning that the Taylor expansion of ln(x-1) likewise has a radius of convergence of 1 around the point x = 0, such that -1<x<1. By inserting x=1 into the Taylor expansion for ln(x-1), he is causing the series to become divergent, thereby inducing the error in the proof that appears to make 2=1. Proof that the Taylor expansion for ln(x+1) fails at x=1: 1) Differentiating ln(1+x), we have: d/dx (ln(1+x)) = 1/(1+x). 2) Trivially, 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-(-x)) = 1/(1-y), where y≡-x. 3) Taking the Maclaurin expansion of 1/(1-y), we have: 1/(1-y) = 1+y+y^2+y^3+y^4+… 4) Note that the result in step 3 is the expression of a geometric series, which has limits of evaluation at |y|<1. Since y≡-x, |y|<1 is equivalent to |-x|<1. Substituting 1 for x, we have |-1|=1<1, which is false, since 1=1 (again, note the difference between 1<1 and 1≤1). For example, substituting x=1 into the previous expression yields: 1/(1+x) = 1/(1-y) = 1+(-1)+1+(-1)+1+(-1)+… This expression is divergent, resulting in the error that causes 2 to appear to equal 1. This concludes the proof.****************************************************************************I greatly enjoyed this debate; you’ll have to challenge me to another some time!', \"I accept this challenge - it'll be nice to actually be able to argue mathematics on here for once, since I've tried starting quite a few math debates before.

Extend this out as a reason why drone strikes aren\\'t working, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.My opponent also never responds to the second Blum et. al card talking about how drone striking terrorist leaders hurts our intelligence gathering abilities, which harms out abilities to stop terrorist plots long-term.

Extend this out for a reason why drone strikes don\\'t actually work, therefore aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.Also, extend out the Speigel Online card talking about how killing one terrorist with drone strikes took sixteen attempts and cost 321 innoncent lives just to get one terrorist. She responds to this by just saying that it\\'s \"collateral damage\" necessary to stop terrorism, but a) we don\\'t even need to be fighting terrorism right now, refer back to the Mueller evidence which says that more people die from drowning in their own bathtubs than from terrorist attacks, and b) just brushing off the deaths of 321 innocent people as \"collateral damage\" doesn\\'t actually justify the use of drones. We shouldn\\'t be contenting ourselves with a faulty method of offing terrorist leaders. We need a method that takes out the man we want to take out and only the man we want to take out on the first try. If it\\'s taking sixteen tries and costing hundreds of innocent lives just to take out one leader, that\\'s not #worth, that\\'s inefficient and ineffective.

This means that my alternative is better by my criteria as well as hers. So, to put it simply: my opponent doesn\\'t really respond to anything I said in the last round, rather just restates her own points. My points are a direct counter to her points. Extend them out. I win.', 'Thanks to pro for starting this debate. I intend to attack the resolution from two different angles:1. That targeted killings are actually effective. If they\\'re ineffective, then there would be no reason to employ them in modern warfare, thus making them not necessary.2. That drone attacks are necessary to conduct modern warfare. If there are other avenues of waging warfare other than using UAVs/Drones, then they aren\\'t necessary for modern warfare.With that let\\'s dive right into things.Argument One: Targeted Killings don\\'t actually work/make things worse. Killing a terrorist leader causes more to grow and retaliate. Hezbollah empirics prove. Blum et. al(1) \"eliminating leaders of terrorist organizations ... may ... effect, the rise of more—and more resolute—leaders to replace them. The decapitating of the organization may also invite retaliation by the other members and followers of the organization. ... when Israel assassinated ... Mussawi ... a more charismatic and successful leader, ... Nassrallah, succeeded ... The armed group then avenged the assassination of its former leader in two separate attacks, blowing up Israeli and Jewish targets in Buenos Aires, ...\" Targeted killing which relies on intelligence hurts the ability of the government to gain intelligence on terrorists. Blum et. al(1) \"Targeted killing may also interfere with important gathering of critical intel ... The threat of being targeted will drive current leaders into hiding, making the monitoring of their ... activities ... difficult. ... if these leaders are found and killed, instead of captured, ... counterterrorism forces lose the ability to interrogate them to obtain potentially valuable information ...\" Really big and strong terrorist groups are not affected by targeted killing empirically. Hunter(3) \"attempting to reduce a group’s operational capabilities through targeted killing is of limited utility when posed against groups practicing advanced security measures. ... to ensure al Qaeda’s operational effectiveness, the group stresses the need to maintain internal security, dividing its operatives into overt and covert members functioning under a single leader…al Qaeda’s global network has survived by its members strictly adhering to the principles of operational security. the continued “success” of al Qaeda (measured in its ability to conduct major terrorist attacks worldwide despite international efforts to eradicate it) is a testament to its members’ adherence to operational security. ... this ongoing viability is evidence of the ineffectiveness of targeted killing (as practiced by the U.S. in this case) ...\" In trying to kill one man, drones killed approximately 321 people, from Spiegel Online(5) \"What is the cost of rendering a terrorist harmless once and for all by killing him? During the course of 14 months, the CIA used unmanned and heavily armed small aircraft known as drones to stage 15 strikes against the presumed locations of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban. On Aug. 5, 2009, on the 16th try, the drones finally managed to kill Baitullah Mehsud. ... and 11 others were killed. ... But the hunt for Mehsud cost the lives of far more than 11 people. According to estimates, ... 321 people died in the course of the 16 attempts to eliminate Mehsud -- and it is certain that not all of them were Taliban fighters.\" Argument Two: Drone Attacks aren\\'t necessary/Other avenues of warfarePost 9/11 Terrorist attacks are overrated – more people die from drowning in bathtubs. Mueller(2) \"Two publications ... have independently provided lists of violence committed by Muslim extremists outside of such war zones ... whether that violence be perpetrated by domestic terrorists or by ones with substantial international connections. ... The lists include not only attacks by al-Qaeda, but also those by its imitators, ... as ones by groups with no apparent connection to it whatever. ... the total number of people killed in the five years after 9/11 in such incidents comes to some 200-300 per year. ... it hardly suggests that al-Qaeda\\'s destructive capacities are monumental. ... over the same period far more people have perished in the United States alone in bathtubs drownings ...\"Alternative to Drone strikes: Support and Cooperate with Pakistani security forces, Innocent(4)\"A better strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan is for the United States to focus on limiting cross-border movement by supporting local Pakistani security forces with a small number of US Special Forces personnel. To improve fighting capabilitiesand enhance cooperation, Washington and Islamabad must increase the number of military-to-military training programs to help hone Pakistan\\'s counterterrorism capabilities and serve as a confidence-building measure to lessen the Pakistan Army\\'s tilt toward radicalism.\" As such, I\\'ve shown that not only do drone strikes not work, not only that they make things worse, but also that we have no need for drone strikes right now and that there are other options for combating terror outside of drone strikes.

For some at least one factor was the consideration of the hundreds thousands of Iraqi and Afghanistan people died and suffered over near to the length of a generation. These same people could also be expected to be angered by the death of our own sons and daughters, friends and family, who sacrifice their lives, physical and mental well being, to serve the Country's interests. The majority though lose sleep over the death of the innocents not counted as our allies and brethren. They are collateral damage, necessary to keep America and our children safe. That what we are told, not just by Fox News, but by the other major networks as well. Imagine a world where people who had the same financial interests in the military industrial complex were also heavily invested in the mass media. Welcome to it. The drones remove a large number of our soldiers from harms way to carry out certain missions, or executions, as the case may be. This is good, we don't want our soldiers to die, and could any ethical or moral reason be good enough to surmount that? It depends how the drones are used of course, but those who control them are those in power, and those in power usually, historically speaking, probably don't have the best interests of the people at heart. Not really. Not the people beyond the sphere of their family, friends and co workers, or their bubble, to be precise. They might believe they do, but that to better sleep at night. Argument 2: Drones are always necessary. Its a more effective way to destroy our target then actually going out there and risking there life's.

REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human Again, all my opponent has argued here is that the potential life inside the woman’s womb is part of the species homo sapiens, and that it will evolve and eventually become a human being. But again, is this enough to justify on illegalizing abortion? No. My opponent dismisses my ‘sentience’ argument because it is a failed theory and unnecessary. It isn’t, that’s why embryos/fetuses have no rights in the first place. I will focus on the sentience and consciousness, which the embryo has not. My opponent states that my theory of the embryo having no sentience relates to a person in a coma. Two things, first, embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because personhood is defined by the state). Second, a person in a coma was obviously already born, and with legal rights thus making him a human being. Let’s take a look at the ‘bear’ scenario my opponent gave in R2; where one man mistakes a person for a bear thus shooting him and killing him accidentally. Now, even though we can say that the benefit of the doubt will go life, we still wouldn’t consider this action to become a killing of an innocent person (i.e.: murder). Why? Because the man thought he was shooting a bear (which can be a danger to him), rather than a real, sentient human. Relating to abortion, if we outlaw most abortions, and when a woman and her doctor think they're killing a non-viable being, they would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter, but it’s hard to judge someone criminally negligent for not personally believing that a pre-sentient embryo is a viable person when we don't actually know this to be the case. There isn’t any sufficient evidence to prove that an embryo is a human being in mind. If we’re following PRO’s logic on embryo being humans, then abortion would be tragic and lethal and should result to murder in all cases, there should be no exceptions, meaning that this will result to many bad consequences. As for it being just and moral, I will address my opponent’s Spiegel argument and morality rebuttal in my Utilitarianism defense below, but to his statement saying, “To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust.”, If I may ask, dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? I’ve already addressed this issue and my opponent hasn’t fully accurately backed this claim up. Please extend my previous rebuttal and the arguments regarding the advantage of abortion and the disadvantage of back alley abortions on the economy. Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. Re: Hippocratic Oath Violation 4 Issues: All arguments from this source {10}. 1) This oath is obsolete and irrelevant since it is historically taken by physicians. This oath is also invalid since it’s a stretch to even argue it. 2) This oath is not binding by law, there is no law required that forces doctors to take this when performing abortion. So what if they break it? 3) Non-doctors perform abortions too. ‘Nuff said. 4) Quoted oath is false. The quoted statement my opponent cited is from the original version, which has already been modernized. And performing an abortion isn’t stated in it. ERGO) This argument is false, invalid and irrelevant. DEFENSE/CASE De: Morality My opponent dismisses this argument stating that it is irrelevant and that I have the BOP. But please note that PRO made this argument first (but forgot to put it in R2), so it’s already proven that killing innocent humans can be morally permissible, and that an embryo is NOT a killing of an innocent human being. Now, to address his rebuttal: Okay, let’s say that contraceptives failed, thus the woman woke up pregnant. It was the woman’s intention to use birth control and wished not have a life attached her, but it failed. Thus making this Utilitarianism argument very much valid. There are also cases where women are morons, they are promiscuous and do not know the outcomes of having sex, we shouldn’t let the woman and the baby suffer. Actually no, there are different kinds of pregnancies {11} which can complicate and danger the woman’s everyday life, like Ectopic pregnancies, RH negative diseases, Group B Strep, Gestational Diabetes, etc. These illnesses limit the woman’s ability to do things, work, shop, take care of stuff. De: Fetus =/= Legal Human I’ve already proven why a fetus is not a human and that the ‘coma’ argument is blatantly false. I’ve also argued why fetuses shouldn’t receive or be considered human. Extend. De:Fetus not really innocent This relates to my morality argument. De: Violates Rights OK, I apologize. I haven’t read the definitions accurately. But the ‘rights’ I’m talking about here are not only legal, but moral, universal or God-given rights that are being violated. In a Utilitarianist view, we need to consider on what is morally permissible and we must consider what the best interest of the mother and child is. Right to choose & to have dignity: Women should have the right to be respected by society, if they do not want children that should be respected. Again, there are cases where birth control fails, where women do not know the outcomes of having children. Most of these women are mostly in poverty where they couldn’t economically handle having a child. {12}. Mothers are responsible for their children, we need to value their right on what they think is safer and right for their children and environment. Do you want children to live in the streets, to suffer and live with abusive parents? De: Crime Yes, this is a US-only debate. I’m introducing the NYT source as pattern evidence. My opponent counters this argument by citing a source from a book, thus must be considered unreliable, I don’t normally attack sources that way but it’s crucial to what we’re arguing. Now, to further clarify abortion=crime correlation; I will quote what I said in the previous round; Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {9}. That source also states that and I quote, “Many women died or suffered serious medical problems after attempting to self-induce their abortions or going to untrained practitioners who performed abortions with primitive methods or in unsanitary conditions. During this time, hospital emergency room staff treated thousands of women who either died or were suffering terrible effects of abortions provided without adequate skill and care.” Now, obviously, illegalizations have no effect due to that source, also this that statement wasn’t accurately refuted by PRO. About my NYT source, please note that the WHO did a research (in countries where abortion is illegal) where they found out that 20 million unsafe abortions are performed per year & 67K of those women die, and between 2 -7 million of these risky abortions result in long-term damage or illnesses. This is only a pattern or what might happen to the US if we illegalize abortion due to back-alley abortion {8}. My opponent needs to prove that illegalizing is more beneficial to society regardless of back-alley abortions where criminals profit more than the state, where mothers have more health risks and are endangered. CITATIONS http://www.debate.org...\", \"Thanks for responding. REBUTTAL Re: Fetus = Human My opponent first noted that he’ll focus on the fetus because most abortions happen in the fetal period. This is false, since he didn’t give a source, I’d like to point out that 9 in 10 abortions in the US occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy {1a} {1b}. That means that the fetus isn’t fully developed yet {2}, which means that the pregnancy is still in its embryonic period {3a}. An embryo is not (yet) a fetus and it’s also not a person and therefore doesn’t have rights. The embryo is not viable or sentient, it cannot survive outside the uterus/womb {3b} so it would be ridiculous to grant them rights. As for his argument on fetuses being human, as you can see, all my opponent has argued that a fetus has life and that it will eventually be human, this is insufficient. It needs more concise evidence, PRO needs to prove that a fetus is conscious, that it is sentient and is aware of its surroundings, existence, thoughts, sensations. But still, this fetus = human argument isn't enough and doesn't entirely mean that we should illegalize abortion. Considering that I’ve shown that the vast majority of abortions occur in the embryonic period, this argument pretty much falls. Furthermore, PRO must prove that an embryo is still as equal as a fetus or a human being, he also needs to show sufficient proof that it is enough to ban them. I’m expanding my rebuttal on this in my contentions below. Re: Abortion: Economical Disadvantage? My opponent seems to be confusing us with calculations and claims that the USFG could have saved 21 trillion USD if Roe wasn’t decided because 50 million un-aborted people could’ve lived by now and each would have earned an average of $42K. This is utterly ridiculous and misleading. Out of those 50 million, how can you say for sure that they didn’t migrate to other countries, or if they even have a decent job, or if they died or have an illness. How can you say for sure that if Roe was overturned by then, this won’t affect 50 million abortions? Women will still abort nevertheless, since they have the means and free will to do whatever they want, regardless of the rule of law. Overall, this argument is a shallow attempt made by PRO which is ambiguous. Next, abortion costs vary {4}, but it isn’t necessarily $350 since there are private orgs funding women and helping them on family planning. There are clinics that provide cheap abortions for women who are poor. There are also state-funded clinics that operate on these practices. So this just means that the state has some profits. Also, since an average of 1.21 million abortions happen each year {1a} and if we multiply that to the costs ($300 to $1000 approx.) {4}, the total would be over $1B profit. Seriously an economical advantage. But let’s look at the downside, if we illegalize abortion, back alley abortions will happen anyway. Would you want the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state? CASE These are my contentions for now, I reserve the right to drop or add more arguments & references later on. C1: Morality This premise actually irrelevant to the topic since this is too broad and controversial. Morality and religion has nothing to do with the legislature and that the government has no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. Furthermore, my opponent failed to show that killing innocent human beings (in this case, the fetuses) are wrong. It seems he forgot, but nevertheless, I will show you why this is not always the case. Utilitarianism A simple definition of Utilitarianism is that it determines the moral worth of an action only by its resulting outcome, and that one can only weigh the morality of an action after knowing all its consequences {5}. Now, a moral philosopher, Judith Thomson offered a thinking experiment {6} {7}: Imagine waking up one morning and find yourself attached to a famous violinist by means of a long tube, that violinist is unconscious. Doctors tell you that if you remove this tube, the Violinist will die. Doctors also tell you that you have to limit your time and you have to eat more. Also, because a parasite-like being is attached to you, you can’t go to work because you cannot concentrate and may suffer from public humility. What if you are poor and you need to work? Is it permissible to kill the violinist? What would most people do? This argument theory proves that even though fetuses/embryos have the right to life, it’s still morally permissible to abort them. Thomson argued that it is. She says that the right to life does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something—the use of your body—to which he has no right. This moral argument relates to women’s rights and why fetuses shouldn’t have rights. See below. C2: Fetus Argument Since the vast majority aborts during the embryonic period, I’m not sure why we need to debate the fetus’ biological form since it has no relevance to the illegalization of this practice, but I’ll proceed anyway. A fetus being human is highly a controversial issue and it will probably never end. Fetus not legally human. Though a fetus can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens, it is not a sentient human being that is a full-fledged member of society. It is neither conscious nor viable. Thus making it not have rights and must not receive the same rights as fully developed humans. If we declare abortion murder should we declare miscarriages manslaughter? Furthermore, as I said, my opponent needs to provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being. ‘Having a life and eventually being a human’ is NOT enough. Fetus not really innocent Addressing the theory presented, J.T stated that even if the embryo/fetus has a right to life, it does NOT have a right to use the pregnant woman's body, so technically, the fetus is not at all innocent as it invades the woman’s privacy and violates women’s rights. Ergo, abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. C3: Illegalization Downside I’m running out of characters, so I’ll make this brief and continue next round. Violates Rights The mother’s right to life is essential, and if we illegalize abortion, we are violating that right. There are many scenarios where the mother’s life is at risk unless she aborts, if we deprive them of aborting, we are not only killing the mother, but also giving society a bad name. It also violates dignity and respect. Women who are raped should not suffer 9 months of carrying a child she did not want, especially if she is poor. A woman should not suffer or be forced to carry a fetus for months. This is a breach to human dignity. The government has the obligation to protect its citizens from harm, if a doctor knows that the baby is ill in the womb, he should advice the mother for her to make a decision. Criminalization also deprives women on the right to choose and healthcare. Since I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion violates rights and that it poses a danger to women, this practice should remain legal. Esp. in the circumstances of rape, incest, health risks, medical need, etc. Crime Before Roe, illegalization didn’t reduce abortions. the estimates of illegal abortions ranged as high as 1.2 million per year, this is almost the same as the number of legal abortions now, we can also assume that millions of women were harmed as a result of illegal abortion, this process is more dangerous, expensive and of course, unlawful {8}. The NY times also showed statistics that abortion whether legal or not will not change society {9}. CONCLUSION In other words, I’ve shown that illegalizing abortion is very much a disadvantage to economy and society and does more harm than good. I’ve negated my opponent’s premises and made my arguments. I await PRO’s response. Good luck! CITATIONS http://goo.gl...\", 'I apologize for the delay.

            "['C1:Fetus=HumanMy opponent dismisses my argument that the fetus/embryo is part of the H. Sapiens species without any valid justification. Also, my opponent has dropped one of my most important points which is that the fetus/embryo has all the human DNA that will ever be developed in its lifetime. Biologically speaking, the embryo is not a potential human life, it is a human life. Coupled with the facts that is it from the H. Sapiens species and has all human DNA, there is no valid justification for not considering the embryo to be a human being. My opponent tries to dismiss my \"coma argument\" by saying that a person in a coma already already has legal rights and is not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights. Legal Rights The argument is moot and invalid from Round 1. Current legality is not of a matter of concern in this debate. Therefore the fact that the person in the coma already had legal rights is dismissed. Not inside the womb and therefore should not have rights I quote from my opponent:\"embryos have no legal rights because they are inside the wombs and will only have rights once they are separated from the mother (Embryos are not recognized by law as having rights because person hood is defined by the state)\"The second part of the argument can be dismissed. How the State currently defines person hood is irrelevant. My opponent states that there is a distinct differentiation between supposed rights of a human being outside the womb and inside the womb. First of all, he has not provided any valid justification for why the human being inside the womb should have less rights than the human being outside the womb. Second, if being inside/outside the womb makes so much difference, then what is the difference between a fetus ten minutes before birth and immediately after birth? Except for the surrounding environment, there are absolutely no differences between these two circumstances. This point of my opponent is therefore refuted. C1: Bear ScenarioIt seems as if my opponent has misunderstood the bear scenario. First of all, the point isn\\'t whether or not the person who shot the gun was doing it accidentally. The point is that it is not worth it to take the risk when there could be a real human being behind the bushes. The man did not think that he was shooting a bear. He knew that it could have been a bear or a human, a 50/50 chance. Whether or not society condemns him is irrelevant. C1: Spiegel\\'s Argument My opponent has virtually dropped this point and he untruthfully proclaims that he will rebut it in the morality segment. His only defense was \"dying is something natural and (one might say) essential, should we consider modern medicine unjust too? \". Death is natural, but that whole argument also hinges on pregnancy having special social value and being the precondition to society. Death does not have any special social value. In fact, if everybody was immortal, and therefore without death, society would be able to function. But without pregnancy, the precondition for society in our world, we would all die out. My point is that even though death is natural, it is not the indispensable means by which society is created nor does it have any special social value. C2: Economical Disadvantage My opponent has done literally nothing here nor in the previous round to rebut my points. I have shown them to be valid under average statistics. I have also left out the fact that many abortion are taxpayer funded which adds to the economic societal detriment. He states that \"Again, having the black market and criminals profit more than the private sector/state is NEVER a good idea to society and economy. \" However, he has nothing to back up his assumption. Black market profits are still economically beneficial as the provider obtains money which he can spend on various societal goods. The people who illegally performed the abortions still spent the money back to society. C3: Hippocratic OathI will address each of my opponent\\'s concerns:1) This oath is not historically taken by physicians; it is still taken by physicians. This also an appeal to novelty. Just because something is old, does not make it any less valid.2) This oath focuses on morality, instead of binding legality. Not only does this debate have nothing to do with current legality, but just because something is not binding, does not make it any less valid.3) False. In the US, only physicians can perform abortions. (8)4) False. According to the National Library of Medicine, that is the original oath. (9)C4: MoralityJust because I did not put it in Round 2, does not mean that I concede that killing innocent human beings is acceptable. Not only is this common logic, but also backed up by my Round 3 rebuttal. My opponent has provided two examples of when he thinks that my case would fall apart due to technicalities. I will rebut both of them. It is highly unlikely that both birth control and physical contraceptives would fail when used together. Anyways, it is possible. My opponent has completely neglected the part where I previously said that by engaging in the act of coitus, the participants are automatically taking up a risk. Contraceptives might reduce the risk, but they don\\'t eliminate them. Whether sub-consciously or consciously, the risk has already been taken and the blame is put on the people engaging in the act of coitus. To put the blame on the baby is absurd and illogical. When a woman\\'s life is threatened, abortion is permissible, as stated by our rules. Also, even if the woman\\'s life is not threatened but she is somewhat temporarily disabled, the killing of the baby is not justified simply because of a temporary \"disability. Would it be justified to kill your child if he would not let you go to work? No. C5: Fetus =/= Legal HumanAgain, the term legal is irrelevant to this debate. You have definitely not proven that the coma argument is invalid. Readers can refer back to \"Fetus=Human\". C6: Fetus not really innocentRefuted as part of Utilitarianism last round and Morality this round. C7: Violates RightsMy opponent mentions \"moral, universal or God-given rights\". He has introduced these so called \"rights\" without any proof of them even existing. My opponent\\'s introduction and statement of these so called \"rights\" absurd and rendered moot. Right to choose and to have dignity- Nobody is forcing women to have children. If they really don\\'t want to then they can abstain from having coitus. Just because birth control fails, it does not automatically give the women the right to abort. As previously discussed, a certain level of risk is accepted simply by engaging in coitus. Just because someone cannot economically handle a child, does not give them the right to kill it. Many different approaches can be taken such as adoption. Also, having lived is better than never having lived. C8: CrimeMy opponent\\'s evidence is not based in the US and therefore is nullified and moot. There is no proof that these patterns would have been replicated in the US. I provided a source which stated otherwise, but apparently my opponent automatically thinks that a book source is invalid with no justification whatsoever. Also, President of Planned Parenthood, Dr. Mary Calderone pointed out in a 1960 American Journal of Health article that Dr. Kinsey showed in 1958 that 84% to 87% of all illegal abortions were performed by licensed physicians in good standing. Dr. Calderone herself concluded that \"90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by physicians. \" It seems that the vast majority of the alleged “back-alley butchers” eventually became the “reproductive health providers” of our present day. (7)Conclusion Embryo is a human. Immoral to kill humans. Abortion is an economical detriment. Women do not have a right to abortion. By having coitus, they are exposing themselves to the risk. I hope that my opponent does not introduce any new information or sources in the next round. Sources:. http://goo.gl...Great debate.', 'Before I proceed, I would like to point out that I made a mistake. Most abortions are in fact performed in the embryonic Period and I will slightly change my argument according to this. This should cause no problem to my opponent as all of his arguments will apply this also. Fetus=HumanA human is defined as (1):A member of the genus Homo and especially of the species H. SapiensBelonging to a species is determined from the DNA of an organism. From the moment of conception, the new organism is a member of the H. Sapiens species. The organism has all of the human DNA that will ever be used or developed in its lifetime that is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. My opponent has failed to address perhaps the strongest point of my case, the fact that an embryo has all human DNA that will ever be obtained in its life. If a human is a member of the H. Sapiens, then a embryo is a human. My opponent has stated that sentience and awareness are necessary for human life. This is obviously not true. By my opponent\\'s theory, a person who is in a coma is not a person, even though he is. Coma patients cannot feel anything outside of them and are unconscious, yet they are still human. This proposition that human life depends on sentience is absurd. Also, pregnancy is an essential tool in the building of society. It is responsible for the development and growth of mankind. Not only this, but it is also a natural cycle by the human body. To deny something natural and essential to life is unjust. Consider an alteration of this argument made by Jim Spiegel:(2)1. Pregnancy is the indispensable means by which humans come into existence and therefore has special social value (indeed, the greatest possible social value because it is the first precondition for society).2. The indispensable means by which something of special social value can occur itself has special value.3. What has special value to human society deserves special social recognition and sanction.4. Abortions which seek to terminate and reject a pregnancy constitute a rejection of the special value of pregnancy.5. To deny the special social value of what has special social value is unjust.6. Therefore, abortion is unjust. My opponent has also asked me to prove that if a embryo were a human, abortion should be banned. This premise is self-explanatory. It is immoral to kill innocent human beings that have done nothing wrong and are coming into existence because of a natural cycle called pregnancy. Economical DisadvantageI used average statistics to determine the calculations. Some people people might have had a worse job, some better. Some might have lived longer, others shorter. These are averages. Some people might have migrated to other countries, but there are no concrete statistics. Even if an unlikely 10% migrated, it would still be an economical detriment. Also, about 14% of all abortions in the United States are paid for with public funds, virtually all of which are state funds. 17 states pay for abortions for some women. (6) This adds on to the detriment. Also, the average abortions costs about $350. (6)My Opponent\\'s CaseC1:MoralityMy opponent is stating the government should have no obligation to enforce morality to human rights. However, the concept of human rights in it self, requires a certain set of morals to recognize them such as not murder, stealing, etc. .. Again, my opponent is stating that it is not necessarily immoral to kill millions of innocent human beings. He has the massive BOP to back this up. C1:UtilitarianismMy opponent has brought a seemingly irrelevant argument into this discussion.1. The person who randomly woke up with a violinist connected has not been previously aware of any sort of risk that this might happen. It simply happened. But this situation does not happen in a pregnancy. Unless CON can show me a woman who doesn\\'t know that sex might lead to pregnancy, the woman has taken the risk upon herself just by having sex. Whether it be subconsciously or consciously, by knowing the possible circumstances in which the sex might result in, she has subjected herself to the risk. When somebody chooses to be subjected to a risk and the risk happens, the blame should only be on themselves, not the innocent human being inside of them. The only time that this might not happen is in cases of rape but this has been defined as no part of this debate in Round 1. 2. The circumstances of the attached violinist and pregnancy are highly different. Pregnant women can still work, earn a salary, go to school, and our society does not condone embarrassment of pregnant women. C2: Fetus not legally humanI already partly addressed this argument in the \"fetus=human\" rebuttal. What I have to mention is that in Round 1, it was explicitly stated that \"This debate is about the future legality of abortion, therefore all present legal arguments for abortion are currently not valid. \". My opponent has accepted the definition as this point is not only violating the rules, but also an invalid point as was mentioned in Round 1. This point should automatically be thrown out, but I will provide a brief rebuttal. My opponent has stated that because an embryo is not conscious, it should not be granted rights. This is false. People in a comatose are given rights are not conscious nor viable. My opponent stated that I need to \" provide accurate evidence on fetuses having almost the same aspects as fully-developed human being\". This has already been done. An embryo or a fetus has all the possible DNA that a human can ever obtain in its lifetime. DNA makes an organism part of a specific species. The embryo cannot be described as \"can be described as a human being, a member of the Homo sapiens,\" (by my opponent). The embryo is a member of the H. Sapiens. C2: Fetus not really innocent1. By having sex, the women is taking the risk of pregnancy. If the woman allows the sex to happen on her own will, then she is allowing the embryo to be inside her. My opponent also has not stated why the embryo or fetus does not have a right to use the pregnant women\\'s body. If it does not have a right to do this, then all pregnancies should be aborted as it is a violation of the rights of the female.2. My opponent has stated that abortion is permissible in certain circumstances. I agree. This was addressed in Round 1 rules. In circumstances in which the female is at the risk of dying or has been raped, abortion is permissible. C3: Violates RightAgain, this has all been addressed in the rules of Round 1. Abortion is permissible in cases of when the women has been raped, incest, or when her life has been threatened. This point is again a violation of the rules and should be disregarded. C3: CrimeMy opponent and I have previously agreed that this debate applies solely to the United States. My opponent\\'s sources are flawed. If you take a look at his #8 source, it applies to worldwide trends in the legalization/de legalization of abortion. It doesn\\'t mention the US and instead talks about Eastern Europe, Uganda, and South Africa. This source and information is invalid. In fact, \"a reasonable estimate for the actual number of criminal abortions per year in the pre legalization era [prior to 1967] would be from a low of 39,000 (1950) to a high of 210,000 (1961) and a mean of 98,000 per year. \"(3)Compared to the 1.5 million+ abortions per year after Roe v. Wade,(4) we can conclude that the legalization/de legalization of abortion causes massive differences. Case:My opponent has given me a chance to post another small contention:The Hippocratic OathAs all abortions today are performed by doctors, all doctors must take the Hippocratic Oath. (5)It states that:\"I will not give a lethal drug to anyone if I am asked, nor will I advise such a plan; and similarly I will not give a woman a pessary to cause an abortion\". An abortion is clearly a violation of the Hippocratic Oath and cannot be deemed to continue. Sources:. http://goo.gl...', 'Now onto mine. The fetus is a humanMy first contention is that a fetus is human. I will choose to focus on a fetus, not a zygote or an embryo because most abortions happen during the fetal period. A fetus is simply the combination of the male sperm, and the women’s ovum. Combining the two creates an entirely unique organism, not alike to its mother or father. There is no doubt that the fetus is biologically alive. It fulfills the four criteria needed to establish biological life: (1) metabolism, (2) growth, (3) reaction to stimuli, and (4) reproduction. (1) A fetus will, in no doubt, become a human being. There is absolutely no question about it. A fetus will turn into a living, breathing, and thinking organism like you and I. So why deny it the same rights that are given to us? Lets take this for an example: You are a hunter out in the woods. You see something rustle in the bushes. You aren’t sure whether it’s a bear, or a human. Is it worth it to take that shot, knowing that there could be a human there? That directly relates to abortion. Even if you aren’t sure whether the fetus is a human, is it worth it to take that risk? Benefit of the doubt should always be given to life, not death. One very important point is that the entire biological and scientific communities agree on one common definition for human life: one human individual’s life begins at the completion of the union of his father’s sperm and his mother’s ovum, a process called \"conception,\" \"fertilization\" or \"fecundation. \" This is according to the one of the only embryology textbooks used in medical schools: Langman’s Medical Embryology written by Thomas W. Sadler PhD(2) Continuing on with the point that a fetus is a human, we have to realize that not only is the fetus being created by the human’s natural processes, it is a unique human individual, just as each of us is. Resulting from the union of the female gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes) and the male gamete (which contains 23 chromosomes), the conceptus is a new—although tiny—individual. A fetus has all of the basic components needed for human life, so to kill it with an abortion would be equivalent of killing a human. It has its own unique genetic code (with forty-six chromosomes), which is neither the mother\\'s nor the father\\'s. From this point until death, no new genetic information is needed to make the unborn entity a unique human individual. In fact according to biology, human development begins with conception. From the moment of conception, the being is complete. Nothing else — no bits or pieces — will be naturally added from this time until the old man or woman dies — nothing but nutrition and oxygen. This being is programmed from within, moving forward in a self-controlled, ongoing process of growth, development, and replacement of his or her own dying cells. To argue the fact that this is not human goes against any scientific and medical standards, which is what our current society is based upon. (3) According to Keith Moore in Essentials of Human Embryology: \"Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). \"Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being. \" To summarize the first contention: I have concluded that a fetus is a living being, is a unique human individual, and is simply a stage of development in the human process. Abortion is economically harmful Abortion is, in fact, economically detrimental to society as a whole. Lets look at some stats. Since the legalization of Roe V Wade in the United States, there have been about 50 million abortion. (4) Abortions cost about $350 dollars to the average citizen. (5) Therefore, over the years that abortion has been legal in the US, the private sector has received 1 750 000 000 000. In other words, one trillion seven-hundred fifty billion dollars. That seems like a large amount, but the amount that the state lost is more. The average US salary is 42 000 per year. (6) The average life expectancy in the US is 78.1 years (7). Abortion was legal from 1973 to current, or 38 years. Since we can assume that every person who wasn\\'t aborted would live to this day, the calculations are relatively simple. Multiply the number of abortion (50 000 000) by (42 000) the average salary per year and then multiply it by 78, the average life expectancy. We receive the number 2 100 000 000 000. That is the amount of money that the State could have gained by not performing abortions. That is considerably larger than the money gained from abortions. Therefore, abortion is a societal economic detriment.

Even the terminator would be killed by an internal explosion. Although this and almost all of the examples are comic relief, he can assumingly use these powers at will. Unlike Roger rabbit rules. (He can only use them when it would be funny.) (2): In an episode where Squidward is describing a murder (Nickelodeon material, right)Spongebob imitates it by chopping off his own arm and grasping it regrowing his arm and cutting off the opposite hand in a wash rinse repeat fashion. I can liken him to a silver terminator right now. (3): Although he is not physically destroyed, in a bullying episode an extremely schwarzenneger-esque fish repeateadly punches him with not a single wince of pain or a drop of sweat. This proceeds for a period of over 24 hours and the fish eventually passes out. As spongebob says, \"I must be made out of some spongy material.\" Stamina: (1): In a complex plot where spongebob gains superpowers. He has the ability to run cartoonishly fast to the point of creating a tornado and burning himself into nothingness. He still sruvives of course and is fully able to gain these superpowers again but never does. (2): In an extremely creepy episode when he is locked in a cave and trying to eat a freind as cannibalism he uses a few lures and traps but manages to last a long time without food. Although the terminator does not need food this could help in the case of Bikini bottom turning into something similar to the deserts and wastelands in Terminator 4. Mentality: (1): When spongebob is fighting a co-worker over a promotion, he goes into a military attitude similar to that of patton and lays elaborate predator style traps to prevent him from going to his workplace. These are so ingenious and cartoonish they would no doubt alone defeat a terminator easier than a pool of molten metal. As an added note for stamina he runs extremely fast to beat the opponent he runs to the workplace for a long point of time although not a supernatural amount. (2): As he is constantly practicing karate with a freind he has (I am serious) trained himself to be aware for any sneak attack and even has Karate gloves handy. Strength: (1): Spongebob has over the past been trained in Karate, Wrestling, Olympics and even has a spatula which can shoot patties as projectiles with shotgun force. I am not making this up. (2): As a phenominally bad driver, it is a running theme to have him destroy the town, buildings and all unintentionnaly. He would be great in a drive by. Over all spongebob wwith no holds barred would be a perfect opponent for anyone out there and might even compare to a silver terminator.', \"I believe that it is a little known fact Spongebob Squarepants is a BAMF. Anyone with a reply may answer and for the time being I will not give away spongebob's powers. All I am saying is no holds in the fight will be barred and by Terminator I mean the standard T-800 Schwarzenegger model. I look forward to this most epic of battles.\"]\n",
            "['Apologies for forfeiting the previous round. Certainly Christianity is the largest single organization for healthcare in the world, but with over a billion members there aren\"t many organizations that could offer that level of service, but that\"s not to say they wouldn\"t if possible. This has nothing to do with Christianity, this is a want to help your fellow man, an instinctive drive that all people and societies need in order for us to survive and evolve. To dispute your point on the church starting the orphanage movement I will direct you to this piece from the writings of Plato, many hundreds of years before the church was helping orphans, by the way, no doubt they were orphans due to some war funded by the church. Plato (Laws, 927) says: \"Orphans should be placed under the care of public guardians. Men should have a fear of the loneliness of orphans and of the souls of their departed parents. A man should love the unfortunate orphan of whom he is guardian as if he were his own child. He should be as careful and as diligent in the management of the orphan\\'s property as of his own or even more careful still.\"(1) Furthermore, you mention Jane Addams, but a recent study of her found that Jane Addams \"had come to epitomize the force of secular humanism.\" Her image was, however, \"reinvented\" by the Christian churches.(2) Here we can see that you have fallen into a trap laid by the church, claiming that one of the brightest lights of humanity belonged to their ranks, when in reality Jane Addams was agnostic at best and indeed a secular humanist. Now to quote you directly: \"He (god) wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves.\" Now this argument is heavily flawed to me, why should this apparent god receive praise for all the good humanity achieves, yet when something bad happens it\"s the humans who are at fault, now to me that seems to be a slight double standard. Now I will leave you with this. In mathematics a positive multiplied by a positive equals a positive, but, a negative multiplied by a positive equals a negative. So if we take all the negatives Christianity has done and all the positives and multiply them together, it is still a negative. To put this in more simple terms imagine a serial killer with 50 innocent victims. Should he be forgiven because he did some charity work on the weekends? The answer is of course no. Christianity is not a force for good in the world. The hatred found in Leviticus and the pedophilia dispersed in the places of worship are enough to see this on their own. Not to mention the other points I have raised. People are good and just enough already to need a bronze-age book dictating their lives. (1)http://www.perseus.tufts.edu...

A Full-Orbed Christianity: The Protestant Churches and Social Welfare in Canada, 1900-1940 McGill-Queen\\'s Press - MQUP, Jan 19, 2001 pg 107', 'When I observe the horrors in the back catalog of Christianity, it seems fitting that the image chosen as their earthly symbol, is one of most abhorrent forms of bronze-age Middle Eastern execution. In order to fully understand the role Christianity plays in the world today we must first look back at the terrors conducted in its repugnant name. Here I will name but a few of the achievements of Christianity: The crusades, the inquisition, the persecution of the Jewish people, the forced conversion of indigenous peoples, the African slave trade and the deafening silence during Hitler\\'s Final Solution. A list of accomplishments, which perhaps, would not be towards the top of ones curriculum vitae. Now to look towards the modern day, the Christian church remains a patriarchal establishment. The injustice to women is institutional. That is half the world\"s population who are doomed to be listed with the livestock. On top of the patriarchy there is of course anti-homosexuality, these are people who are being punished by the church, not for what they believe, but for who they love and how they express it. This cannot be good for the world. Love is so desperately lacking in life, love needs dispensing not suppressing. Another unforgivable aspect of the modern day church is the idea that AIDS as a disease is bad, however, not as bad as condoms. Millions dead, for whom? And for what? It certainly wasn\\'t for any force of good. Finally in this opening statement I will briefly touch on the most reprehensible part of Christianity in recent times, the long-standing institutional child rape. I do not think I need to expand on the point of pedophilia and why it is wrong. A force for good? Well, unquestionably not a good that I would fight for. No one can argue Christianity doesn\\'t have some wonderful morals, however, these morals are not exclusive to Christianity, and the works of charity done by Christians are not exclusive to Christians. The force for good is already within human beings, Christianity, perhaps not intentionally, but undoubtedly persistently, distorts it.', 'I will be arguing against the premise. The debate will go as follows. 1) Acceptance 2) Opening statement 3) Rebuttal 4) Closing statement']\n",
            "[\"Ultimately the question being asked is if Christianity is a force of good in the world. IS it a force for good, not HAS it been a force for good. And ultimately even when you look at it from two different angles, it's apparent that indeed our God is a God of love. He wants us to be loving and caring, and when humanity strays from those values, who is to blame? Not The Lord, but in fact ourselves. Thank you.\", \"While you are correct about the crusades and other battles fought over Christianity, remember that while the humans may not always make the right choices, the religion governing them wants them to. The bible itself is indeed a strong force for good, and there are countless major benefits from Christianity. The church is the single largest provider of healthcare and education in the world, especially in the poorest countries where it is needed most. Christianity also pioneered social work. The first American woman to ever be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize was Jane Addams. The church also co-founded the first settlement house in the US, hoping to bridge the gap between poor and rich. The London society for the prevention of cruelty to children, or the London SCCP, campaigning from the wider church, was the first force to stop cruelty towards children, and from them the first UK law about child neglect and cruelty was created. Churches were also the first orphanages, opening their arms in the Middle Ages to unwanted children that were left at the Churches' doorsteps. This practice ultimately started the orphanage movements we have today. I could go on for hours listing the countless things Christianity has done for the world.\", 'Hello, thanks for putting out the challenge. Shall we hear the opening argument against the matter?']\n",

It is not, however, legal for someone to kill a human, especially for cannibalism (crime against humanity). It is undebatable that human nature leads us to believe that we are more important than any other animal. Why so? That is irrelevant to the resolution. It is only used for comparison. On the other hand, with my opponent's logic a person should die in place for a chicken. That said, I would like to add that I believe cruel treatment of animals is wrong. However, my opponents alternative is clearly contradictory to most beliefs. If a couple of chickens have to die in order to create a cure for cancer, so be it.

The reason my opponent votes negative on Animal Testing is because animals do not deserve the cruelties put upon them. However, my opponents alternative is flawed for the following reasons. 1. It is essential in scientific and technological advances. As long as pain and suffering for the animals is minimized, I believe that it is acceptable to use testing on animals as opposed to having humans go through the same process. That said, it is very impractical to have humans endure these tests. 2. It would prevent any harmful side-effects had the testing been done on humans. The ethics is questionable. However, it is widely believed that the value of a human is MUCH greater than the value on an animal. It is undebatable that we, as people, would rather have someone else do something. As long as everyone accepts this fact, there are no ethical dilemmas. In summary, I believe that animal testing is VERY desirable and the ethical issues are outweighed by the benefits of using them as opposed to human beings. My opponents argument is loose and the alternative is impractical and may cause danger to human beings.']\n",

Moreover, the concepts of \"Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping?,\" \"getting laid,\" and \"dropping a baby eight months later\" don\\'t seem like very gender-equal principles. The opponent states, \"Prom on DDO isnt supposed to be as serious as the one on real life, its supposed to be a fun hook up game.\" This doesn\\'t really correspond with the actual concept of a prom. This is more like the parody of a prom, which is not addressed in the resolution or in the initial argument. Guys will hook up with guys, and then the anti-gay marriage people will be offended and violence will ensue. Let us remember that 33% of DDO is anti-gay marriage [1], so this would not be the most gay-friendly event. 2) Regardless of how they act, many DDO members are beyond high school (and prom) age. Take RoyLatham for example [2]; he is married and probably has no interest in finding a date for an online prom. This prom idea excludes many important members of the DDO community who are married or whose partners are not interested in joining them in a virtual prom. And I\\'m posing the idea that this would make younger DDO users more vulnerable to predatory attacks by pedophiles who lurk all over the internet, including DDO. 3) I don\\'t know if this prom thing would even catch on, so I wouldn\\'t emphasize the gossip argument too much. And if the event fails, then the gossip will simply be negative (i.e., how moronic imabench is for coming up with this concept.) 4) ...What? So basically it consists of baseless voting from anyone on DDO who chooses to vote? This has nothing to do with the traditional concept of Prom King and Prom Queen, which actually typically involves votes from people who actually know them. 5) Well, that really has little to do with the actual concept of \"prom,\" but all right, then. 6) \"Hook up\" with anonymous people on an online debate site? What would that even entail? Where would the gossip arise from, by the way? From what I see, this whole idea would be forum-based... ... So, uh, in conclusion... Um, in conclusion... Why the **** am I debating this? ... [1] http://www.debate.org... [2] http://www.debate.org...', '1) There is no indication that girls are not treated well by guys right now. And it is not plausible that a virtual prom would lead to a strong increase in conduct; in fact, I think trolling would spike. The anonymity offered by the internet allows for people to not take this \"prom\" thing as seriously as they would in real life. On the point that \"the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls,\" it will be likely that many guys will be left without prom dates and therefore be vengeful, leading to a number of prom-crashing attempts; hence, the opponent\\'s theory that there would be an upswing in conduct is nullified. 2) Many of the males on here have already completed high school, but for those that have not, it would be risky for them to attempt to contact \"prom dates\" on this site, which consists of many anonymous members whose true backgrounds are unknown to us. Having adolescent males staying in contact with people who state that they are males on this website is not a good idea. 3) The opponent hasn\\'t proven whether or not the gossip would benefit DDO or not. Moreover, the whole \"acid in the punch\" and \"getting laid\" stuff seems to be a little.... Uh, how would this prom even work? 4) What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen? It would most likely just be based on debates, because that\\'s how most of the people on here know each other... So what is the use of incorporating the \"prom\" concept in their names? 5) This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it.

Look at any trial or any case where one person accuses another of cheating, votebombing, voting unfairly, yatta yatta yatta and people eat it up. This gossip though would be harmless since its just a bunch of people having fake hookups....4) Prom King + Queen\"What would be the criteria to vote for Prom King and Prom Queen?\"It could be the cutest couple, the surprise couple, the weirdest couple, its a popularity contest and the winners are just chosen by voters who vote for any couple for any reason. 5) Prom Mafia\"This argument would just shows that a prom, in general, can have fun things going on during it. It is not germane to the resolution\"DDO Prom would be 1/2 anouncing who is with who on one forum and then 1/2 fun prom action stuff in the game forum with other things sprinkled in. 6) How would it even work?Prom will be held on 1 week every year, and it would be the same week each time. In the time leading up to it people would \"hook up\" with others online and then when the time comes simply announce who their prom date would be. Then as the week progresses Prom activities and games are done as people discuss who hooked up with who, who got stood up, and gossip while a host of Prom games are held in the game forum which will be based loosely off of other mafia style games. At the end of the week a contest will be held to determine the Prom King and Queen, along with a few other awards for other things, and then after that Prom ends, the site goes back to normal, gossip dies down, and in the end everyone becomes a little more friendly with each other in this website that over time has already grown into its own warped definition of a community. The next year at the same time the same thing happens again and a few tweaks are made to fix problems seen last year, etc etcThat is how Prom would work on DDO :)', 'Very Well then, reasons that DDO should have a Prom 1) It will make everyone more sociable and appreciative towards the females on DDO. It is a well known fact that the number of guys on this site heavily outnumbers the number of girls on here (at a rate of 2:1). If DDO had a prom then guys on DDO would in theory become more sociable and act more gentlemen-like towards women on DDO. Such a spike in conduct here on DDO among its members would also be welcomed to offset the usual amount of d*ckish behavior one normally sees between members in the forums and debates. 2) Guys need this Lets face it, people who spend a disproportionate amount of time on DDO most likely do not have as much luck with the ladies as they would like. A prom on DDO though allows those men to exercise their age old pickup lines, learn how to talk to women, and learn how to get the courage to ask a girl to prom, something that could benefit them later in life when their actual high school Prom comes around. 3) The gossip This is the biggest part about why there should be a prom in my opinion.... All the gossip that would be started once it was realized who showed up with the prom to who, it would be awesome! Does inferno get a date? Who is lucky enough to show up with Danielle as a date? Who does Royalpaladin choose to go with? If Jimtimmy gets a prom date then HOW THE HELL did he pull that off? Who was lucky enough to show up with Rogue or Mirza? Who will Thaddeus and FREEDO ask to Prom? Who will Innomen go to Prom with? Will anybody be lucky enough to have 2 or more prom dates and look like hes pimping? Does somebody have a prom-night-dumpster-baby? Who tries to put acid in the punch? Who wakes up the next morning with a guy she doesnt know? Who gets laid that very night? Who drops a baby 8 months later? The gossip it would cause would diffuse all of the usual feuds we see going on in the forums, allow everyone to cool off, and have a bit of fun just gossiping over stuff. 4) Prom King and Queen This would be the biggest election on DDO next to the presidential election of DDO, Prom King and Queen would hold their title for an entire year (longer than the president would hold his) So if prom were to be held on DDO then a great honor would be given to the winning couple, and a tradition could form out of it, giving DDO some swagger and class. 5) Prom Mafia Yes you heard me right, Prom mafia. A game where everyone makes strategic moves against one another at Prom for personal reasons. During such a game one may \"accidentally\" spill their drink on someone they dont like, change the song midway through the dance, hit on somebody else\\'s prom date in an effort to try to catch them all (Pokemon!), or even to start dropping it like its hot and showing off some wicked dance moves. Such a thing would make Prom way more fun both for those who socialize on here and for those really into the gaming culture here on DDO.

Anyway, Americans don\\'t care if the game is close, hell they encourage a blow out, as long as its for the Red, White, and Blue.

With faster communication, satellite television, and air travel. Any one anywhere can communicate with people all over the world about sports, watch sporting events from all over the world, and even fly to any sporting event anywhere in the world. The ultimate winner from this has been the World Cup of Soccer (To simplify this debate I will use Soccer for the international game of Futball and Football for the American game of football.) What happens there? Countries send teams from all over the world, that spend the two leading up years trying to qualify, to the world's biggest stage, with the game's biggest stars, competing in a tournament with team as well as national pride on the line. FIFA (The international soccer organization) rakes in the money on their ideal invention, Qualify countries rake in money and international exposure and pride for winning. The world stands still and the entire sports world turns to one event that is seen all over the world. In America, we have long dis-enfranchised soccer, we set out to make a new and better sport: We call it football. And to America's credit, we have certainly embraced the sport. Developing it to a level of local pride and power that no use leagues or even our own US national teams can compete with: The NFL. The world stands still for soccer, America football. The problem with the American dream to create a sport to compete with soccer is that they actually have to compete with it not hide in their own corner and pout. Football, like soccer, has to become an international sport, contended on a world level, that does not limit its to the confines of the US. The will to play the sport is constently expanding, the sport itself is perhaps even expanding faster then American perception. The fear is that if we let other people play our sport, they might get better at it then us. Though the US may not be able to keep its dominance in the sport forever, like in Basketball, a little competition isn't that bad is it? What I'm proposing is a World Cup, or International competition of Football, where teams from around the world send national teams to advance the game to its highest level. The Format of the Cup would depend on the number of teams participating, obviously if to many want to participate then the issue would arise for regional qualifying and such, but the simple truth remains the need exists. The goal and orginal purpose of Football was to contend with soccer, and the only way to do that is to take the competition inter-national. The main American resent is that no one else plays, so why bother? If you build it, they will come. http://pointme.to... Illustrates numerous international Football sites and leagues (though some outdated) which Play Football. The obvious initial entries would be the United States, Canada, Mexico, Great Britian, Germany, Japan, and China. Several other European countries show interest, and small countries would probally jump in at least at first just to fill numbers and get international exposure. Yes, it is true the competition could get lopsided if NFL plays all go in on the side of the US, but playing gap would thin out and competition would increase. Even international Soccer competition outside of the upper crust is extremely titled to the bigger teams who's talent alone allow them to crush their opponents. Though constents blow outs wouldn't be fun, some games would be close. If not necessarily the US's games, the other competition would be on the same field. International Basketball has grown even with the US as a dominating leader in the sport really unbeaten when they try, however through time and exposure of the game, the sport has been able to grow in ways previously unimaginable. http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com... The sportsbusiness Journal reports the NFL in 9 Billion dollars in debt, that was over a year ago so no it probally a lot more. The NFL despite its huge popularity and selling out its games is running a defecit due to the few amount of games played and the large stadiums they build and then allow to sit empty most of the year. Cities could bid on having the world cup of football and thus bring in money, and if the NFL was smart they could create the world cup and thus add to their revenues with very little actual cost out put because the Stadiums are already built so just play in one of them. The World Cup could even be played in the Spring/Summer to give football fans, going through off-season withdrawl, the abiality to see new live football action with some of their favorite stars. The enjoyment of the Nation watching the redeem team this year capture the gold in Beijing could be seen on a football field. The Cup could be stage ever 2 or four years, but probally 2 since they won't add it as an Olympic sport. Having international games in the off-season would allow fans to get tastes football all year round, and also promote international fans with a taste of the NFL drawing in more viewers and potential markets for the NFL to dive into. A Football World Cup would be very profitable to anyone who hosted, I mean if Colleges can bring in 60,000 for their spring games (which are inter-squad), I think a little real competition would go over with the public quiet well. The Purpuse of football was to compete with the world, and untill they do that its purpose will not be achieved.\"]\n",
            "['Challenge Accepted!', 'I have no response for my opponents argument. points to con for his outstanding rebuttal.', \"My opponent… “The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people's rights.” Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women). You stated that you were pro sex-education and the main point of sex education is abstinence and sexual awareness so what is expected of the sexual education teacher to teach? Sex is just fine no matter what age? Only protected sex is okay? Abstinence is the best way of preventing pregnancy unless you feel differently? The main reason society looks down on or even rejects promiscuity is because many are taught abstinence from a young age and they are taught abstinence from a young age to help women from being thrown into a situation they never planned to be in. “Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society.” Again, a big point teachers make in sexual health classes is the fact abstinence is the best choice until marriage. If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. “Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girl’s appearance or behavior.” The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. My arguments First of all I would like to clarify that promiscuity in both males and females is wrong but for the sake of this debate I will argue how and why it is wrong in females. Unexpected Pregnancy One major social issue our society deals with is abortion. While some are pro-life and some are pro-choice I think it is clear we can all agree that abortion should be at least the last resort. The most effective way to prevent abortions is not getting pregnant and the most effective way to not get pregnant is abstinence. Effects of Unexpected Pregnancy The majority of the women who get pregnant before they are married will not end up getting married. This of course leads a huge burden on the mother having to deal with. According to the U.S Census Bureau %27.3 of single parents live in poverty. Also, the effects of children growing up without a parent can be drastic… Drinking problems.Teenagers living in single-parent households are more likely to abuse alcohol and at an earlier age compared to children reared in two-parent households Suicidal Tendencies.In a study of 146 adolescent friends of 26 adolescent suicide victims, teens living in single-parent families are not only more likely to commit suicide but also more likely to suffer from psychological disorders, when compared to teens living in intact families. Disturbing news:Children of never-married mothers are more than twice as likely to have been treated for an emotional or behavioral problem. Expelled:Nationally, 15.3 percent of children living with a never-married mother and 10.7 percent of children living with a divorced mother have been expelled or suspended from school, compared to only 4.4 percent of children living with both biological parents. College odds:Children from disrupted families are 20 percent more unlikely to attend college than kids from intact, two-parent families. Criminal Behavior:The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later criminal behavior. In the case of a teenage mother, the absence of a father also increases the risk of harshness from the mother.Seventy-two percent of adolescent murderers grew up without fathers. Sixty percent of America's rapists grew up the same way. As you can see promiscuity can lead to unwanted pregnancy which leads on to abortions and fatherless kids which carries out to more drastic measures such as the statistics mentioned above. Spread of STD’s Another result from promiscuity is the spread of STD’s. Often enough promiscuous women having unprotected sex will contract an STD. The woman could have it without knowing which is putting potential future partners at risk. Sad but true... A woman who is sexually promiscuous is more likely to be raped then a woman who is not. I am not saying that all rape victims are promiscuous or victim blaming in any way but a woman who dresses sexually provocative is more likely to be targeted by a rapist. Although it is not the victims fault in any way, women should make sure to be away and use protective measures to reduce the chance of falling victim to predators. I have proved that promiscuity leads to terrible things such as unexpected pregnancy, STD’s, and even rape. It is obvious that in today’s society men and women are held at double standards but I feel it is fair to say promiscuity is harmful regardless of your gender. I look forward to my opponents rebuttal :) http://www.policymic.com... http://www.photius.com...\"]\n",
            "[\"My proposed debate is based on the social paradigm that women shouldn't indulge in casual or frecuent sex, and those who do be frowned upon by society. I will be arguing CON, which means I will defend women having the right to practice sex freely without being discriminated or condenmed.\", 'My opponent stated:\"Sex is not just a physical thing as my opponent tries to dumb it down to be, it also has psychological and emotional effect on people (mainly women).

If a young girl commits herself for whatever reason (religion, personal, familial) to avoiding sexual activity and stays true to her commitment then it is obvious why praise is necessary. \"I believe there has been a misunderstanding regarding the terminology. The point of sex-education is not abstinence. The point of sex education is to reduce risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, and equip individuals to make informed decisions about their personal sexual activity. What my opponent is referring to is called abstinence-only sexual education, an obsolete approach that focuses solely on abstinence as a tool to fight unhealthy sex practices. What I am proposing is called comprehensive sex education, which also adds the options of contraceptives, safe sex and non vaginal sex practices. Of course, at first glance, abstinence seems like the better choice, for it is a 100% certain way to avoid pregnancy and STD\\'s. Nevertheless, it has been proven to be very inefficient as an approach to sex education: Abstinence-only sex education has been found to be ineffective in decreasing the HIV risk in the developed world. [1] Abstinence-only sex education has also been found to increase unplanned pregnancy. [2] The concept of no premarital sex is evidently flawed, for it completely neglects the issues for individuals to whom marriage is not valued or desired, not to mention those for whom it\\'s not allowed (specifically LGBT). It distorts information, revealing only the failure rates of contraceptives and not their high success rates and benefits. [3] The whole approach is focused on a compulsory dogma of chastity, rather than an informed decision taking methodology, unsuitable with our free thinking society. Why should abstinence be regarded as the one and only way to prevent sex related problems? Why not tell teenagers that the average condom has a 98% success rate when used correctly, or that the contraceptive pill has a 99.7% success rate? [4] Why should they be discouraged from practicing non vaginal sexual activities such as anal sex, mutual masturbation or oral sex? If there are efficient ways to practice sex with relative safety, the social paradigm is pointless. The truth is that \"slut shaming\" is not a matter of public health as much as it is a matter of sexism and socio-religious principle. My opponent claims:\"The concept of girls being cautious is, I feel, often misunderstood. This advice is not given to victim-blame but to prevent girls from being put in this situation. Example: If a car thief was on the loose you would not tell car owners to leave the keys in the car and the door unlocked simply because it is not their fault that their car could be stolen and the car thief should know better. You tell girls to use caution not to communicate to men that it is okay to rape but to prevent a woman from falling victim. \"My case is not against prevention. It all depends on how the advise is presented. Of course women should not get in strangers\\' cars or accept beverages handed to them by unknowns. We must accept the fact that sick individuals exist, and they should be handled as the threat they are. We must raise consciousness the same way we would advert a kid against a pedophile. What I find offensive is when females are told they shouldn\\'t dress in a particular way, or that they should build up an image of chastity for themselves in order to reduce the risk of rape. This is almost like endorsing the animalistic instincts of some degenerates, treating them as poor souls tempted by desire instead of the degenerate criminals they are. As to my opponent\\'s arguments, they all derive from pregnancy and STD\\'s, let us go deeper: Undesired Pregnancy. I share my opponent\\'s opinion on the disadvantages of this issue. However, I don\\'t see how it\\'s a valid reason to indulge in hatred and discrimination of promiscuous women. As it\\'s already been discussed, there are ways to live an active safe life and avoid pregnancy. It is absurd to condemn someone over the mere possibility of pregnancy. Why should a girl who has successfully avoided pregnancy by the correct use of contraceptives be victim of bigotry in the hands of society? It is not fair. Similarly, there are women who accept the responsibility of their mistakes, and become caring and loving mothers. These brave women shouldn\\'t fall under the judgemental eye of society either. A group can never, ever be judged based on the behavior of some of its individuals, this means all promiscuous females should not be judged on the behalf of their irresponsible peers. So, instead of judging promiscuity, society should put the pressure over irresponsibility. In other words, as long as the woman is not causing the social damages of giving birth to an unwanted child and neglecting him or her, she has no reason to be criticised. Sexually Transmitted Diseases. This is even less of a reason to endorse \"slut shaming\". Again, people who are promiscuous but have taken measures to remain clean have no reason to be frowned upon. Assuming people received the appropriate sex education my case is arguing for, there should be no doubts concerning the risks of sexual acts. If one party decides to engage in a sex act with another party, he or she does it in full understanding of the risk that implies getting infected. Contrarily, if a person unknowingly contracts a disease it is not a problem of promiscuity but of sexual ignorance. Finally, I will address the portion of the debate where my opponent argues promiscuity is a cause of rape, and should therefore be rejected. Let me reduce this un-cited argument with an example. It is known that middle and high class citizens are more likely to be targeted by kidnappers. Do we ask them to stop earning money? Do we judge them for having large amounts of money? No, it would be illogical, they make money because they obtain pleasure from it. The same applies to our issue: women should be careful, the same way affluent individuals take safety measures to prevent kidnapping, but they should not be told to give up an active sex life just to prevent rape. Moreover, this debate is not about promiscuity being right or wrong, or about the pros and cons of abstinence versus promiscuity. This debate is about women having a right to practice sex freely, without being discriminated. It needs to be understood that the mere fact of having frequent and casual sex has no immoral value on its own. It\\'s an issue of the tolerance and acceptance (not necessarily approval) that these women deserve. Sources:[1] Underhill, K; Operario, D, Montgomery, P (2007 Oct 17). Operario, Don. ed. \"Abstinence-only programs for HIVinfection prevention in high-income countries\"[2] Kohler, Pamela; Lafferty, William (2008 Apr). \"Abstinence-Only and Comprehensive Sex Education and the Initiation of Sexual Activity and Teen Pregnancy\". Journal of Adolescent Health[3] Effective Sex Education, Brigid McKeon, 2006[4] \"Planned Parenthood IUD Birth Control\" - Mirena IUD', 'Thank you for accepting my challenge, I hope it\\'s an enlightening debate.To clarify what i am debating against, I will introduce an unofficial but popular term that describes my case perfectly: \"Slut shaming\" is defined as the act of making a woman feel guilty or inferior for engaging in sexual behaviors that violate traditional expectations. [1] Observe:In its declaration of sexual rights, the World Health Organization (the public health branch of the United Nations) states:Sexual rights embrace human rights that are already recognized in national laws, international human rights documents and other consensus documents. These include the right of all persons, free of coercion, discrimination and violence, to:the highest attainable standard of health in relation to sexuality, including access to sexual and reproductive health care services;seek, receive and impart information in relation to sexuality;sexuality education;respect for bodily integrity;choice of partner;decide to be sexually active or not;consensual sexual relations;consensual marriage;decide whether or not, and when to have children; andpursue a satisfying, safe and pleasurable sexual life. [2].Let us examine some particular points, like \"right to decide to be sexually active or not\", \"right to consensual sexual relations\", and the \"right to pursue a satisfying safe and pleasurable sexual life\". The declaration grants every human being, including women, the right to live a sex life as they desire, as long as it does not violate other people\\'s rights. This means that if a woman finds it sexually satifying and pleasurable to lead a promiscous life style, she should be allowed to do so without any form of discrimination or social disproval, for she is only excerting the sexual rights mentioned above.Please note that I am not advocating for a society that encourages promiscuity, less one that promotes unprotected sex or other unsafe sexual practices. I am in favor of sex education (in fact, the delcaration states that as a right). My debate only rises from the common conception that a promiscuity in women is something rejectable and that deserves social criticism (whereas promiscuity in men is usually admired and even encouraged.) Virgin praising is yet another factor that contributes to this culture. It is usually desirable for a woman to be a virgin, and virgins are well seen by society. Why should a woman who choses to have sex automatically be relegated to a lower social category? Why should sexually active men prefer virgins over sexually active women? It is unfair, and should not be accepted under any circumstance.This phenomenum causes many social illnesses, like rape culture, victim blaming, sexual bullying and objectification, based on the belief that a woman who choses to live an active sex life is not worthy of respect, and just represents a source of pleasure for men. Not only are women judged on their sex lives, but also on the clothes they wear, the places they visit, or the partners they engage with. This constitutes an essential violation of human rights, for no person should be discrimintaed on the basis of gender [3]. Women should be allowed to chose how they dress, what places to visit and how many times they have sex without being frowned upon or objectified. Girls should not be taught to be chaste and careful just to avoid rape, instead, men should be thought rape is as unthinkable as cannibalism, and not justified in any way by a girls appearence or behavior. Women should not be told to dress conservative in order to \"get respect\", respect should be inherent, and men should be expected to respect any woman, regardless of her looks.Sources:[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...[2] http://www.un.org...[3] http://www.upsettingrapeculture.com...']\n",
            "[\"What you're arguing about is completely off what the title suggests 'Both Christianity and Islam encourage excessive cruelty to animals' means that the ideology that the person follows encourages the follower to torture animals, and be excessively cruel towards them. Thus far, all you've proven is how many farms are owned by Christians / Muslims, and statistics shown about how much meat is consumed by people who follow Christianity / Islam. You haven't proven how each ideology promotes excessive amounts of cruelty to animals, you've only shown how much meat is eaten and how many farms are owned by people who follow each religion. There has been no evidence about the Bible or the Quran, no criticism of the ideology, and nothing about excessive cruelty. You've only criticized the people, of the religion and not the religion itself. Needless to say, your statements have only been promoting veganism, and only proves about the excessive amount of meat eaten, which is an entirely different topic from this, and not a single word about how each religion promotes animal cruelty. Christians work in factories + Factories are cruel to animals = Christianity promotes cruelty. This is your logic and reasoning behind it as far as I can tell, which only adresses the people, but not the ideology. You also mentioned how the factory farming industry is cruel. Yet, this doesn't equate at all to how Christianity or Islam promotes excessive cruelty towards animals, and have strayed completely off topic. You said that referring to the text for each religion would result in bias. That means that you haven't argued the topic AT ALL. For the part about turning Christians into vegetarians / vegans, you're doing nothing more than forcing your own ideals onto other people, which obviously doesn't work, and losing your faith over such a thing. Like how people complain about Christians shoving Christianity down their throats, you have been doing the same with veganism.

This may be the case for Islam, but what about Christianity? In your example, you didn't give any direct quotes from the bible, or any real life cases about the topic related to Christianity. The bible doesn't encourage EXCESSIVE cruelty to animals, it says to end them quickly. And animal sacrifices for Christianity have been long put out of practice, by the bible itself. And your comment on looking at the actions of people rather than the belief. Since in the title you are criticizing the ideology (christian / Islam) rather than the people (christian / muslim), the statement made about looking at the people's actions is irrelevant, considering this is a conversation about an ideology, rather than the people. By the looks of what your statement said, a more fitting title would be 'Muslims encourage excessive cruelty towards animals'.\", 'Though I am extremely anti - Islam (due to the fact they encourage violence to all non believers rather than just non - innocent people), I can\\'t find evidence relating to how they are cruel to animals.

It is well known that Christianity is around 70% in the USA and factory farming is rampant the USA. [3]99% of animals are raised on factory farms in the USA. [4] The majority of USA citizens are Christian. 99% of animals raised in the USA are from factory farms. Factory farming is infamous for its terrible cruelty. Therefore there is a strong positive relationship between Christianity and factory farming. I can only come to the conclusion that Christianity causes animal cruelty. As for other religions, this may also be true, but is a red herring. If religion x causes cruelty to animals, this won\\'t change the fact that Christianity causes cruelty to animals. As for judging a religion by its religious texts, I\\'ve already gone over this in this debate any many others. Religious texts have many contradictory passages. Since people are self motivated they often select the passage that benefits them the most, using conformation bias to ignore the contradictory passage. \"Gee, God says animals don\\'t have souls, gave us souls, gave us dominion over animals, Jesus ate fish, and Jesus said it was moral to eat meat.\" Completely overlooking the anti-cruelty passages. If I had to point to one event that turned me from a Christian to an agnostic it is this.Nevermind that the body is a temple of the holy spirit. That if you defile your body God will destroy you. Oh no, Jesus ate one fish so then we can rationalize every single misdeed we perform to animals based upon this. I just found it was impossible to convince Christians to turn vegetarian. I honestly lost my faith arguing vegan issues with Christians on this debate site.

You can make point A and then complete opposite from a different passage in the same religious texts. Which then leads to confirmation bias. A reader will then pick which side of the topic to follow based upon his/her person agenda and bias. Therefore, we must judge how a religion treats animals based upon the actions of its followers. As already seen in r1, Christians an Muslims tend to treat animals horribly. Note this same train of thought could be made for violence. That religion x states in part A of its religious texts peace and part B war. That means a person following the religion will pick whatever benefits him/her the most. Finally, to really determine how a religion treats animals, we must compare the actions of followers of various religions. That way we can see how they stack up. Overall, Christianity and Islam treat animals much worse than Hinduism and Buddhism. Also, note many animal rights activist gravitate towards atheism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Which also shows that these religions have more respect for animals. Thanks for debating.', 'More and more I am seeing little use for either of these religions in modern day.

I think it is well known about the Christian capitalistic factory farms. The old testament Kosher slaughtering of animals. That Christians can morally use animals for food, clothing, and experimentation. Yet, what about the newcomer to the western world? Is Islam any better?

There\\'s no reason to choose to forego rounds as opposed to conceding or voiding. You also recommended extending debate time to busy opponents. I find this to be a bad idea because we would have a floating debate making absolutely no progress. I find this to be a problem already. Currently, it would take 3 days per round to end a debate that has come to a standstill. Your suggestion would make it even longer. With my method, all you do is void the debate and start it again when your opponent isn\\'t so busy. That way, no one\\'s scores get hurt, there\\'s no unnecessary voting, and we free forum space. Your final point about lengthening the number of rounds, I\\'m so-so about. While it seems good in theory, there really should be a limit. Debate is about putting your points forward as succinctly as possible, not who gets the last post or who\\'s the most long-winded. Adding in extra rounds may be more enjoyable to debaters, but not to voters or spectators. And it definitely takes away from the integrity of debate. If we implement these ideas of yours, debates would definitely be longer, but not necessarily better. I\\'m trying to improve quality by trimming out the crappy debates (when one person leaves, when one person concedes, when one person just doesn\\'t want to respond or can\\'t respond, etc.) Your suggestions prioritize quantity over quality. Bad debates don\\'t need to be longer, and good debates don\\'t need to be dragged on forever. That would make them bad.', \"I won't get too flowery with this opening statement. There are many instances where a person may start a debate and not be able to finish it. Schoolwork, family emergencies, etc. These can interfere with a debate. In addition, a person may have made a fatal error in judgment, or realized that an opponent's point cannot be countered. I believe that there should be two extra options: 1. Concede debate. This automatically takes you out of the debate. The benefit of this is that in a multi-round debate, if you find you cannot win, or want to concede for any other reason, you don't force the rest of the site to wait 3 days per round before they can vote. 2. Void debate This sends a request to the opponent to void the debate. In this case, there are no winners and the debate is deleted. Thus, a person cannot be voted for unfairly if the opponent has encountered some emergency.\"]\n",

If something means nothing it has no attributes that make it ikely in the first place, if it has no likelihood it has no possibility, and is therefore impossible.

The resolution therefore fails.', 'My opponent made no case and no rebuttal. The resolution is negated.', 'Pro picked a good topic, because cap and trade legislation is said to be next on Obama\\'s agenda. It\\'s a shame that Pro had nothing to say about the subject. Pro failed to define \"justification\" or to offer any proof that the legislation passed by the House meets any standard of justification. I will assume that \"justified\" means having \"having benefits outweighing its costs.\" 1. The theory of global warming crisis is at this point proved largely invalid, so there is no climate justification. CO2 is indeed a greenhouse gas, so that increased CO2 causes some global warming. The physics of carbon dioxide are such that doubling the present amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would produce about 1.5 degrees of temperature rise. That\\'s comparable to past prosperous warm periods like the Medieval Warm Period, when Greenland was named for its greenery, and the Holocene Optimum, about 6000 years ago when civilizations rose in the Middle East. Global warming crisis theorists claim secondary effects in the atmosphere multiply the CO2 effect to crisis proportions, causing not just 1.5 degrees of warming, but 4.5 degrees of warming or more. The claim was based upon the warming that occurred from 1970 to 1995. Crisis theorists claimed that there was nothing else going on affecting climate: no solar effects, no volcanoes, no ocean cycles ... nothing except the rise in CO2. Therefore, they argued, there must be a multiplying effect for the CO2. The disproof is that even the UN now admits that there has been no global warming for the past 15 years, yet CO2 has continued to increase. If there is nothing else going on, as crisis theorists continue to claim, why have the predictions failed? Clearly there *is* something going on that is at least as important as CO2 effects. In fact, it is probably a combination of several factors such as multiple ocean cycles adding, a lack of volcanic activity (that causes cooling), and lower cosmic ray activity (that provides cloud seeding). In addition, analysis of \"natural experiments\" where CO2 has increased locally shows that the effects of CO2 are as the physics predicts, and are not multiplied. http://www.junkscience.com... Also see the book \"Chill\" by Peter Taylor for a discussion of the recent science. 2. Let\\'s assume for debate purposes that there is a CO2 crisis, and also that the legislation will work exactly as proposed, an extremely unlikely outcome. Even under those assumptions, computer models developed by the Government for the purpose of justifying the legislation show that the reduction in temperature rise would be only 0.05 C. http://gwswindle.blogspot.com... It is in the realm of a symbolic act to appease climate gods. If one believes in climate crisis, the right approach to fixing the problem lies in climate engineering. Climate engineering solutions could provide and actual cure, and do not pose all the international challenges and disastrous consequences posed by cap and trade. http://www.newscientist.com... 3. Cap and trade is not justified because it formalizes a system of payoffs. The system takes money from people who need to heat and cool their homes and from industries that provide jobs and gives it to a vast enforcement bureaucracy, to politicians who use it to dispense favors, and to middlemen who make a fortune trading the credits. Politicians control who suffers and who gets the riches. It has been tried in Europe, with widespread corruption the result. http://online.wsj.com... The system makes the middlemen trading credits rich. It the US, a prime trading beneficiary would be General Electric. http://thecommonconservative.com... GE has given huge support the Obama and the Democrats. They will be paid off handsomely for their support. The corruption is inherent. \"The cap-and-trade system being touted on Capitol Hill would create a multibillion-dollar playground that would, once again, create a group of wealthy traders benefiting at the expense of millions of average families—middle to low-income households that would end up paying more for food, energy, and almost everything else they buy.\" http://www.usnews.com... 4. Cap-and-trade will have an insignificant effect on global CO2 emissions. Europe has had both cap and trade and subscription to the Kyoto Protocol. The US has neither, but the US emission history is better. \"In recent years, despite all efforts following the Kyoto Summit, CO2 emissions have been rising more steeply in Europe than in the U.S.A. Like it or not, those are the hard facts.\" http://www.leonardo-energy.org... 5. Cap-and-trade causes industry to shift out of the developed world into the lesser developed countries, so even the tiny reductions in CO2 promised will not be achieved. In Europe, a third of their CO2 emission are transferred out. http://www.theecologist.org... In the US, California has its own green energy initiatives that dramatically increased energy costs. The result so far is that half the industry has moved out of the state. Nationwide cap and trade legislation would punish energy-intensive heavy industry in America, moving it China, India, and other countries that refuse to destroy their economies with exorbitant energy prices. http://hotair.com... \"According to an analysis of climate legislation performed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the cap-and-trade system favored by President Barack Obama and many congressional Democrats could potentially damage the U.S. manufacturing sector and force jobs to move overseas. ... s the EPA states: \"A cap-and-trade policy increases the price of energy-intensive goods. The majority of this price increase is ultimately passed onto consumers. … [L]ower income households are disproportionately affected by a GHG (Green House Gas) cap-and-trade policy because they spend a higher fraction of their incomes on energy-intensive goods.\"\" http://www.cnsnews.com... 6. In an odd twist, cap and trade may actual increase CO2 emissions, by making conversion to natural gas uneconomic. Improvements in technology have made supplies of natural gas cheaper and more abundant. Gas burns producing less CO2 than coal, so initially it seems that cap and trade would benefit the gas industry. However, to win approval in coal producing states, Democrats included special dispensations for the coal states. (It\\'s like the Pope giving out indulgences in the Middle Ages.) In a free market for energy, cheaper natural gas would displace coal over time, reducing CO2 emissions. But under the proposed legislation, carbon credits go to coal and not to natural gas, keeping coal viable where is would ordinarily be displaced. Cap and trade is unjustified because it would have no significant effect on global warming and might even increase it; it will dramatically increase energy costs to consumers for the benefit of the politically favored, and it will drive jobs and industry other countries. \" ... estimates of job losses attributable to cap-and-trade range in the hundreds of thousands. The price for energy paid by the American consumer also will rise. The studies reviewed showed electricity prices jumping 5-15% by 2015, natural gas prices up 12-50% by 2015, and gasoline prices up 9-145% by 2015.\" http://www.usnews.com...

            "['Your argument is good, your points are well made, and I have just realized one thing. That is, that each of us agree that education and punishment should be balanced, right? Now that I have isolated the things that we agree on, we can look at more concerning matters. Harlan: \"I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring.\" Can I just say, that criminals decide to donate their organs, as with the case of the gang leader in Singapore. He said to his wife and mistress that he wanted to donate his organs. After he was hanged, the organs were given to needy people, saving at least 5 lives. Harlan: \"You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life.\" Harlan, do judges really put them in for life? Face the reality, they will not be put in for life. After another 10-20 years, they\\'ll come out and kill more. \\'One-third of the nation\\'s executions take place in Texas—and the steepest decline in homicides has occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas, which together account for nearly half the nation\\'s executions.\\' That is a good point made by whoever made that. Harlan: \"\\'Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\\' Well, too bad. It\\'s their job.\" I can point out that people can find new jobs. Harlan: \"Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness.\" If everyone was as narrow-minded as Harlan, people would kill more openly, knowing that they won\\'t be jailed up for long. Knowing that they will be out soon. To do it all again. Thats usually/always the case. \\'Two gun\\' Crowley: \"Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do no body any harm.\" And when Crowley arrived at the electric chair, did he say: \"This is what I get for killing?\". No. He said: \"This is what I get for defending myself.\" Al Capone: \"I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" So I would like to conclude, that I reckon that education and punishment should be used together with greater effectiveness and greater efficiency. The death sentence will be used in appropriate situations. But if possible, be deterred. Therefore, the death sentence should stay, and be used under certain circumstances. Also, alright has one L.', 'The Contender has many flaws in his argument. Firstly, \"Harlan\" says \"I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear.\" This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases. The other half of his point tells us that he would like to see more \"education\" rather \"than fear\". I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose? A famous gangster and killer called Al Capone once said \"I have spent the best of my life giving people the lighter pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the existence of a hunted man.\" Yes. Thats the word of the most feared gang leader in Chicago. As you can see, criminals don\\'t see how they are wrong, and they won\\'t see how they are wrong through \"education\". Men like Al Capone think like that. There is no way of escaping that fact. Secondly, \"Harlan\" doesn\\'t get the point of a death sentence. Here are his words: \"Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs.\" So what \"Harlan\" is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \"kill more people in order to get organs\". Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment. The organ donation is just a way of a \\'repayment\\' of the people they\\'ve killed etc. And also, only healthy organs will be chosen (I would also like to add that healthy blood can also be donated). And as \"Harlan\" said:\" I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized.\" This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person. Why doesn\\'t \"Harlan\" feel sorry for those who were killed? Why, \"Harlan\"? Thirdly, \"Harlan\" says: \"The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one.\" This proves that \"Harlan\" does not understand the point. I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues. And as \"Harlan\" says: \"Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution.\" Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe. And also, \"Harlan\" still doesn\\'t get the point. The death sentence is a fair punishment for a an \"attrocious\" crime. \"Harlan\" is relating the death sentence as a way of getting rid of people. That\\'s not my point! And even more important, isn\\'t a \"mental institution\" just another phrase for \"jail\"? They do have rehabilitation places in prisons you know. And lastly, \"Harlan\" says: \"There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary.\" This proves again that \"Harlan\" does not understand. We are not trying to get rid of people. We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood. We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population. We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done. And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \"Harlan\\'s\" argument.', \"There once was a man who killed a couple of people, went into jail, came out to kill more people, went back in again, and killed more people after coming out. There wouldn't have been so many deaths if a death sentence was introduced. This may seem inhumane, but since when did killing people become humane? In some countries, there is no death sentence, and since there isn't, it should be introduced. First of all, death sentences reduce the number of cold criminals behind bars. They carried out serious offences, now they have to pay the price, it all seems pretty normal. Secondly, the organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them. This is a good way to repay all the lives that the criminal has killed. Thirdly, a death sentence introduced could decrease the number of murders every year. When pre-criminals hear that a death sentence is being introduced, they usually stop. This is a good way to stop serious assault and murder and a way to save lives. Thus the death sentence should be introduced to countries who don't have such a law.\"]\n",
            "['You know you don\\'t need to put my name in quotation marks. Allright, my opponent\\'s rebuttal was quite lengthy so I will answer each of his points in turn. \"This tells us that \"Harlan\" agrees with my point of view, and would like to see the death penalty applied in some cases.\" This is false. Punishment does not necessarily mean death. Punishment can mean exile, jail, a fine, or even public service. You have twisted my words around so that the punishment means death. That\\'s a cheap card to play, man. \"I would like to point out that we are thoroughly educated when we are young. Police come to our schools to talk about what to do and what not to do. But does this serve any purpose?\" I would like to clarify that I am in no way suggesting that education will completely eliminate all crime. And likewise, the fear of being punished will also (and does) not eliminate all crime. By citing a single incident of education failing to discourage a man from crime in no way proves that education is completely useless in the effort of decreasing crime. If I so pleased, I could do the same thing with your method of decreasing crime via fear, by citing incidents of people going on killing sprees despite the fact that they will almost certainly wind up in prison or in the electric chair. But regardless of the effectiveness of education when compared to fear, it must be acknowledged that education is a better foundation for society than fear. It creates a healthier atmosphere, and makes the populace moral people, rather than immoral people who are scared to act out their immoral ideas. And once more, I am not saying that punishment should be completely eliminated, I am saying that a balance should be made, with alot of emphasis on education, and less emphasis on punishment. \"So what \\'Harlan\\' is saying here, that the death sentence is in place to \\'kill more people in order to get organs\\'. Thats what he\\'s saying. The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\" Here you go again twisting my words. I never said that the death sentence is in place for any purpose. This is a hypothetical debate (see resolution), and has nothing to do with any death-sentence policy that exists in real life. I was merely responding to your hypothetical death-sentence ideas, which you happened to justify on the basis that \"organs and body parts they have could be donated to those who need them\" (see round 1). Those are your words, not mine. What you have done in the above quote is completely changed your argument to \"The point is, that if someone commits an \"attrocious\" crime, they get a fair punishment.\", while completely ignoring my rebuttal to your original point (the one you just pretended you didn\\'t make), which was that the felon\\'s organs could be used. \"This proves that he is feeling sorry for the criminal who has killed lots of people and thinks that this is dishonoring the person.\" It\\'s not so much a matter of \"feeling sorry\", as you have twisted my words to say, as it is honoring every Human being\\'s fundamental rights, regardless of their personality. Once more, 2 wrongs do not make a right, and with that in mind it can be said that it is not justified to deny a fellow Human being of his rights, no matter what the scenario is. I think using their organs against their will would be immoral and dishonoring. \"Why doesn\\'t \\'Harlan\\' feel sorry for those who were killed?\" Where could you have possibly made this conclusion out of anything that I said in round 1? Now you are simply making up stuff that I said. \"I am not talking of prison break outs. I am talking of how people are released because their time is up and then they get put out into the public, and then they kill more people (which is almost always the case), and then they get sent to jail again, and then the cycle continues.\" Once more, this is a problem that has a simple and practical solution: don\\'t release them. You have made it clear that the crux of the problem is not that they are alive, but that they are being released from jail when they shouldn\\'t be. The same people who you are suggesting to be jazzed with electricity could simply be kept in jail for life. \"Well, can I just say, people don\\'t enjoy working with killers. They don\\'t feel safe.\" Well, too bad. It\\'s their job. \"We are not trying to get rid of people.\" Neither of us said this. \"We are not trying to find ways to donate organs or blood.\" Those were your words, not mine. \"We are not trying to find ways of lowering a population.\" I never said this either. \"We are just trying to find a way to fairly punish someone for what they\\'ve done.\" Fairness is a narrow-minded and naive way of punishing criminals. Punishment should never be about fairness. It should be about discouraging criminals, and (if the punishment is one compatible with this goal) possibly keep them away from society for practical reasons. I fail to see a reason to punish people for the sake of fairness. \"And can I also say, that there are spelling and grammar mistakes in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument. Take the word \"attrocious\" for example. That was in \\'Harlan\\'s\\' argument.\" Fine, if we ARE playing that game, then I guess I\\'ll play too. In the above quote, his first sentence did not need a comma and should have had a quotation mark instead of a period, since it was phrased as a question. Also (I wasn\\'t going to say anything, but I suppose I will), he misquoted Al Capone earlier. -Harlan', 'My opponent has 3 main parts to his argument. I will answer each of these in turn. 1. That the Criminals have to \"pay the price\". It is a commonly accepted moral concept that two wrongs do not make a right. Basicaly, immoral acts are never warranted, even when the victim of said acts is inhumane and immoral to the extreme. The moral aspects of this ideology are obviously flawed. The only practical aspect of this is idea is that it may discourage people from performing horrible acts. I think that while punishment is necessary in some places, society should mainly put emphasis on education as means to discouraging people from doing attrocious things, rather than fear. 2. The organs of felons could be harvested and put into the bodies of other people. Plenty of people die already, so I don\\'t think it is necessary to kill more people in order to get organs. Furthermore, I would see this as dishonoring to the person punished, if they did not give consent before-hand for their organs to be utilized. Or at least consent from the family. It also seems unlikely to me that the sort of people who end up getting the death sentance are people who are very healthy. 3. It would decrease the # of murders. The case of prison break-outs is a very rare one. And even if this were a genuine problem, the most serious of prisoners (that might have people on the outside who could break them out), could simply put in a higher security prison, such as alkatraz. This seems like a practical and humane solution to the same problem. Also, if it is determined that a prisoner is so dangerous that not only are they not suitable for society, but not suitable for being with other human beings (inmates) at all, they can be put in a mental institution. There are many practical solutions that would make the death sentence wholly unnecessary. And while it would be more efficient, it is inhumane. It is not absolutely necessary, and therefore it should be avoided, considering the matter at hand.']\n",

Con then moves the goal posts on me and now claims, \"There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military.\" Ok, I don\\'t use the word \"absolutely\" in reference to future outcomes unless I am dealing with math, and even then I am cautious. If you would tell me what you mean by a government take over then we can talk. Do you mean regulations? Hospitals becoming government owned? Do mean government ran health care competing against private carriers? Are you talking about Medicare? How can I address such a vague point? The statement is simply rhetorical and has little meaning. Con follows with a statement referencing less government in healthcare right now. Well we do not have a universal health coverage plan currently so are you referencing current regulations? Medicare? Do you see the problem here, Con? You chose hot buttons \"big government\" and \"government take over\" and then referenced the present day situation. He states: \"The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way.\" \"If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to.\" This must be present day so how does it apply to current legislation in Congress which has not passed? Now if this is the case we can avoid any discussion about health care proposals, but Con goes further and asks for tort reform. He states: \"If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform.\" I thought you wanted less government involvement. Tort reform in reference to malpractice cases would require MORE involvement from the government, not less as tort law and damages is generally left up to the states, not the federal government. http://www.settlementcentral.com... This is one of the problems with allowing interstate commerce with insurance companies. Your proposal involves more federal control, not less. Why would you remove state involvement in torts, by claiming the federal government should step in and reform torts at a federal level all the while claiming you want less federal government? At this point, your rhetoric is contradictory so how can I debate an issue you refuse to define and go against a contradictory position? All I can do is point out the flaws in your position as I still have no idea what the Con position is saying. Con states: \"I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american (sic) but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true.\" This is an argument from ignorance and yes claims need support. If you are unwilling to support your arguments, don\\'t present them. I have no need to address this further. Con states: \"This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda.\" Did I mention Hannity already? This statement needs support. Define radical socialists, administration, and what exactly this \"administration\" has done concerning a furtherance of this \"radical socialist agenda.\" This is just hot button rhetoric and needs not be addressed further. Con must do better than right wing pundit talking points. \"First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government.\" If you would have defined socialism I could have addressed this point. Socialism is so broad that I cannot, in the space provided, explain all facets, but as instigator you certainly could have done so. You chose not to give us a definition so I have nothing to clash with at this point. \"Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate.\" On a dark and stormy night … not so much. President Obama spoke directly to Republicans concerning many issues in the health care debate. How is this in the cover of darkness? I can read all the legislation presented on this subject as it is publicly available. President Obama made clear when running for President that he supported universal coverage in reference to health care and would focus on implementing legislation in this respect. We all had a vote. We elected him. How is this secretive? More and more rhetoric, nothing solid here. I\\'m tired. The only point Con brought forward was a poll. He did not link the poll, the methodology, the margin of error, nothing. He said it was there. Rasmussen? I would love to view the methodology used and see the full results but unlike truly scientific polls, the results are hidden … unless you pay for them. \"All the data collected by Rasmussen Reports, not just the portion we make public.\" For 20 bucks a month, no thank you. http://www.rasmussenreports.com... Really? Talk about \"in the cover of darkness\". The instigator has offered very little here. I cannot address a contention unless it is defined. Rhetoric is for the mindless masses, I need facts and data, or at a minimum, definitions.', 'I wish him good luck. I stand in refutation to my opponent\\'s contentions and will address them. Con wrote, \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything. \" I disagree. Our government has run one of the most powerful armed forces in the world. As for dysfunctional government, I recommend Somalia. Next my opponent offers that health care, an ambiguous term, encompasses 1/6 of the US economy. I ask my opponent, as he is the instigator, to support this statement and I ask for a definition of economy in relation to this figure. I cannot attack a figure my opponent does not source. Define health care also please. Con offers polls, but offers…no polls! Show me and I will deal with them. He then offers some rhetoric in the form of \"cramming down our throats\". Cramming what? Be more specific. Tell me what the US government crammed down my throat. Con wants to hear from those who have blind faith in big government. I am not sure who these people are, but I support my government and as a former member of the greatest Air Force in the world, I swore my life to our defense. I no not support blind faith in any matters, religious or otherwise, and Con did not define big government or blind faith. At this point, the instigator has only offered one solid contention and that contention is that the US government cannot run anything, but I submit that the US military run by our government is the greatest in the world. I can do little more until the instigator presents a case with something more than rhetoric.']\n",
            "[\"Wow, Pro is quite the technical debater. I have a lot of respect for his skills. To be honest I was expecting to have an ideological debate. I think Pro would make a fine politician. However, here is the problem as I see it. Americans hate politicians because they are masters at doing the same thing you are doing. They talk and talk about data and polls and margins of error and everyone is left with their heads spinning. It is a very calculated technique used to where down opposition until they just throw their hands up and say fine just do whatever. To use another sports analogy, I shoot and you block over and over again. This is a very safe way for you to win a debate and you most likely will but we still have little idea of why universal health is good for America. Instead of only blocking how about a shot. Pro chose to be pro on health care. So lets hear some pro commentary. Pro does not need to sit there on his high horse waiting for me to deliver the perfectly executed and statistical debate. Pro should just state where he stands. If Pro was a politician, what would his platform be. I want to hear why moving toward more government control of our health care is better. I believe the reason the health care bill is having so much trouble is because no one can really explain why and how it is better. Admittedly I spend most my time working so I do have time to hear or read everything but this is true with most Americans. So why doesn't Pro educate me and tell me and anyone who might read this what part of the health care monstrosity bill is good and what part is not. I will be honest about my ideology. Brace yourself because it is very radical. I want to return to the constitution. What is Pro's ideology.\", 'First of all I want to say that i love the US military. Pro is right it is a very functional part of government. However, I certainly would not put the military and government in the same category. They respond to executive commands from the feds but are a completely separate substructure to the government. It is made up of extremely talented and qualified personnel operating under a chain of command in a enviroment of extreme competition and accountablity. There is absolutely no way that a government take over of health care could ever operate as efficiently as the military. Besides the military is something that the citizens can not do for themselves. Health care on the other hand is. The people are perfectly capable of providing their own health care with out the big bloated federal government getting in the way. Abraham Lincoln said that \"The worst thing you can do for those you love is the things they could and should do themselves\". If only we had less government involved in health care then free market would be allowed to work as it is supposed to. I can\\'t event buy health insurance across state lines if I want to. The solution is less government, not more. What if I went to my job and the more I screw up the more i was promoted. That would not make sense. So why with the feds we continue to give them more power the more they screw up? I am sure that pro will ask me to scour the internet looking for data from some research agency to back up my claim that government has continually made things worse for the average american but that would take a very long time and be inconclusive so I\\'m not going to do it. But I think most people know it to be true. Just look at the debt we are in that we will never be able to get out of. Health care for everyone will only ad to this debt. If you believe universal health care will save us money than i have some beach front property i would like to sell you. If you\\'ll notice the proposed bill does not address any common sense solutions like more competition across state lines or tort reform. This is not an accident. This health care reform is not about health care but a gigantic power grab by administration to advance its radical socialistic agenda. I\\'m not saying that socialism is a bad thing as long as everyone knows exactly how it works and what it is. First I would like everyone to understand that socialism is the polar opposite to the way our founders established this country with limited government. If we are able to have an open and honest debate about how much government we want and Americans decide they want to move away from our founders had intended then I am ok with that. But it does not happen like that. Progressive steps are made toward socialism in the cover of darkness without honest debate. I found in Rasmussen that 52% of voters oppose the proposed health care plan while 44% favor. As far as the 1/6 economy comment, just type that sentence in google and you will see lots of stats to prove it. I agree with Pro that what i have said is mostly rhetoric based on opinion. But this is the format of debate i would like have with someone. Statistical battles rarely get you anywhere. I would like to have a general discussion about how much government we want and how much individual responsiblity we want. Pro has a tactic to win a debate which consists of delegitimizing my argument but i am still waiting for someone to come up with some solid points that stand on its own to support the need for big government. Can anyone out there do this?', \"I have absolutely no confidence that our dysfunctional federal government can run anything never the less something as large as health care that makes up about 1/6 of the US economy. The polls have shown that the people don't believe so either but yet they still try to cram it down our throats. I would like to hear from some people who still have this blind faith in big government.\"]\n",
            "[\"My closing statement is that we have known for years the earth is not flat. It's like arguing that Barack Obama is Satan.\", 'I am so sorry for the forfeit and the lateness of this argument. I understand how pointless it can make a debate seem, however I really like this one. Thank you for the extension. To start with my opening argument, I will use your definition of \\'flat.\\' I agree that the surface is wide, however, it is far from smooth. Because our world is three dimensional, things clearly stick out of the ground, such as the house or apartment you live in[2]. The earth definitely does not have little thickness, either. In fact, it is more than 4,000 miles deep[1]! This would also mean mountains and earthquakes would be unable to form[7]. Your definition of flat does not fit the earth. However, it is a lot closer to being spherical. From satellite images, we see the earth as a circle{1}. We can also see different countries on the earth depending on the angle, while the circle does not change size{2}. That would bring us to the logical conclusion that it must instead be a sphere. Rebuttals: If we lived on the flat side of the earth\\'s circle, and not the curved edge, your explanation of the sun and moon\\'s rotation would not hold up. Instead of the sun appearing to rise one way and set the other, it would seem to appear already in the sky and slowly rotate in one direction. It would be the same way with the moon. They would ever cross the center of the earth without having no sun at all for the rest of the planet either, and would completely invalidate our system of time[3] and make day and night nonexistent. This model also causes problems with the rest of our solar system. We have proven that the planets rotate around the sun[4]. If the sun rotated around the earth instead, the other planets would not have the same days of their own[5]. \"Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick.\" That paragraph made little sense grammatically, but I think I understood the point. If I were zooming past earth at the speed of light, I of course would see nothing as our eyes can\\'t process things that fast[6].

            "['All points extended.', 'Okay so let\\'s get down to some crazy things for this wounderous debate. So to clarify I will be debating that the Earth is flat by using the Neo-Classical Model with the following descripition. The earth is finite disk. The earth is being accelerate upwards at approximately 9.80665 m/s2. The earth is the only known \"disk\" in the universe. The laws of physics are the same in every inertial reference frame. The speed of light, measured in any inertial reference frame, always has the same value, c. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) Contention 1: Rotation of sun and the seasons. One of the greatest questions you have right now is probably if the Earth is flat how does day and night work. Well the answer is actually that the Sun and the moon rotate around the Earth in a circular motion. As seen in the gif that I\\'ve provided above you can painly see that ti\\'s a spotlight type roation as it rotates around the Earth illuminating only a certain portion of the Earth at a time simulating both night and day. Here we can the if we were a photon that the Earth would shrink to ironically the same thickness that I have previously described. Here is a simulator that shows the exact same thing. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Seasons are explained above. As the Sun moves closer to the poles it becomes colder in the northern hemisphere while when the Sun is closer to the equatro it is actually summer time. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) If we use the above model we can see that the Earth is indeed the center of the Universe. Though the other planets may orbit the sun we can see that the sun and the rest of the solar system orbits around the Earth. Further proof that the Earth is flat is when we observe cosmic rays and that they travel the speed of light. Now if we look at the simulator that I have provided you we can see that as things approach the speed of light they are flattend. (http://demonstrations.wolfram.com...) Cosmic rays called Muans are better known to collide in our atmosphere and we shouldn\\'t be recieving barely any, however we get a whole lot more then expected, but since they\\'re going so fast the Earth is flatter and the distance they have to cover is a whole lot closer. If you were a proton moving 99.999999% the speed of light you can see that the Earth would only appear to be 17 meters thick. Contention 2: Gravity Now before you jump to several statements that Gravity should collapse the Earth into a sphere there is just one problem with that. Gravity doesn\\'t exist. How in the world is this you may ask. Well you can see that the Earth is actually accelerating up at the acceration of 9.88 meters per second. This explains Newton\\'s gravitationial theory, but Newton was incorrect here. (http://wiki.tfes.org...) With the increased accerlation it becomes apparent that this also causes you to be shorter at the end of the day. Now to further this I would like to clarify that gravitation, not gravity exists. This explains the tides as stars and the moon/other celestial bodies all have slight gravitationial pull. Here is a list on how they are different in order to clarify the debate up a tad bit. - Gravity or the gravitational field is a vector field, while gravitational force is only a vector. - Gravity lies in the radial direction from the mass, while gravitational force is in the direction of the line connecting the two masses. - Gravitational field requires only one mass, while two masses are required for gravitational force. - Gravitational force is equal to the product of the mass of the test object and the gravitational field intensity. (http://www.differencebetween.com...) Now I want you to imagin living on this Earth, which as I showed earlier is just a flat disk. The gravitational force is actually angled to the point to where as you get further and further away from the center (the north pole) you can see that the increasing gravitationial force would cause you to want to fall back towards the center and not want to go towards the edge of the Earth. The people living away from the north pole would have their living conditions inclined in order to meet such a force. It would feel like you are trying to clime up a steeper and steeper hill. Contary to belief you wouldn\\'t fall off the edge due to the gravitationial vector pointing back towards the north pole, the actual fear would be falling off the edge and rolling back towards the center as shown in the picture above. That is all for my opening arguments and my rebuttles shall come in the next round as requested by my opponent.', \"This debate is impossible to accept.

            "['I will address the arguments with tags, in order of the RD 2 posting. I thank my opponent for his response, and look forward to the final round :) I ran out of characters in RD 1 for the proper thank yous and whatnot. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On instinct (clarification of my position): My opponent fundamentally misunderstands the argument I\\'m making in terms of instinct, especially in terms of stratification. We didn\\'t emulate the behavior of other animals—we are an animal, and animals all have the instinct to stratify. Stratification is a part of survival, as is socialization. My opponent also disregards all of my analysis that actually validates the stratification argument. Allow me to reiterate: 1. Stratification does not have to be negative. Animals other than human beings don\\'t tend to oppress. They simply establish an order, with survival-related duties, and are able to work cooperatively to achieve a desired end, which is the survival of the entire community. Stratification does not have to be a servant to self-love, as my opponent asserts. Greed and superiority are not the same as natural herd stratification. Don\\'t allow him to equate the two. 2. I never wanted us to disregard the teachings of men like Marx. In fact, I specifically stated in RD 1 that there are pieces of profound truth to communist theory that we should be integrating into our political and social realities. However, I still maintain that a society without any sort of stratification is an impossibility, simply because stratification is a survival tool utilized by all members of the animal kingdom. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On stratification and its characterization (important extension here): My opponent severely overestimates my conception of stratification. I don\\'t believe I was unclear prior, but if I was, I apologize. Capitalism, in and of itself, does not encourage any of the harms that my opponent or Marx accuse it of. In fact, as I stated in RD 1, all governments are liable to these shortcomings, as all governments are made of a mixed bag of people. Until humans are homogeneously altruistic, Communism can\\'t work. This is a key point that I want the voters to extend, as my opponent and Marx fail to take human differentiation into account. Capitalism operates within the realm of observed human behavior while giving humanity room to grow into more altruistic tendencies (as Capitalism uses these behaviors and instincts to benefit the entire community—see Adam Smith). Communism requires that all of its followers be uniformly virtuous from the beginning, which is purely unrealistic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On self-interest (my opponent\\'s same tag line): Self-love, as Adam Smith calls it, keeps the butcher being a butcher. My opponent has yet to clearly articulate how goods and services would be exchanged within a Communist system while not creating the stratification that I say is necessary to keep a society functioning at equilibrium. If the butcher can do something easier and still receive the same amount of goods or services in return, then the butcher will choose the easier profession. This is not a categorically true scenario, but it is highly realistic. While societies have made some misjudgments and mistakes regarding which professions deserve more merit than others, this is yet another moment where pieces of communist theory might temper the functioning of a Capitalist system. However, if I am to receive no merit for spending 10 years in medical school, racking up debts and killing myself for the benefit of society, why should I be a brain surgeon? Again, my opponent assumes that all people can or will be homogeneous in their altruism, which is simply untrue. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ On \"rotten apples\": My opponent is making categorical assertions about Capitalism based on some of its misapplication in the world. Not every capitalist society operates in this fashion. Capitalism is a spectrum of application, and this is just more evidence as to why Communism can\\'t work. Capitalism at least accounts for human differentiation and arms people with tools to fight back against the \"rotten apples.\" Since my opponent enjoys making generalizations about existing governments, I\\'ll make one in turn: all manifestations of Communism have degenerated into Socialism. Why? The reason is because the naivete of the theory makes it supremely simple to dupe an entire population into dictatorship. The fact that multiple forms of Capitalism have succeeded in the world while Communism has not, after multiple attempts, suggests that education cannot overcome all. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- On proletariat revolution & oppressor vs. oppressed (key extension here): 1. Marx really does advocate the entire overthrow of the current social system. He says this directly in his manifesto. I can quote it if my opponent would like me to do so. 2. The French Revolution is precisely the sort of thing that Freire was talking about, so I\\'m not sure how my opponent, who is a student of Communist theory, can simply shrug off my comparison. While the French Revolution wasn\\'t ever meant to instill Communism, it is a direct, historical example of the oppressed becoming extreme oppressors. Rather than simply eliminating the current social order via the head of state, the middle & lower class uprising felt it necessary to murder thousands of nobles, as well, most of whom merely held a title higher than the revolutionaries\\'. Even Freire, a passionate Communist and Marxist, admits that this is an incredibly dangerous result of Proletariat uprisings. And the French Revolution isn\\'t the only time we\\'ve seen this result. Look to Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as much of South America. 3. While violence and the switching of superiority may contradict Communism\\'s ultimate goal, that doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t happen. My opponent entirely drops all arguments I make for the necessity of retribution within humanity\\'s schema of justice, which is huge to my advocacy. The reason the roles tend to switch is because of our need for retributive justice, which is another human trait seen unadulteratedly around the world. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ In summation, my opponent has still not been able to prove that Communism, as Marx envisioned it, can actually exist for any amount of time. I remind voters that he must prove that human beings can be uniformly altruistic, and that human beings do not need natural stratification in order to survive. Also, I want to especially highlight the problems Communism has with retributive justice. Since my opponent did not address this, I encourage you to weigh this heavily in the round.', 'Communism, in theory, espouses noble ideals for humanity. It encourages, essentially, blind equality and shared resources, and discourages the stratification that seems to plague the planet\\'s human societies. However, though we may learn many tidbits of wisdom with which we may perfect human existence, a truly unadulterated Communist society we shall never see. While I normally would not write a case in this fashion, today\\'s arguments will be primarily in essay form, as my advocacy requires it. My apologies. My primary assertion today is that it is genetically and instinctually impossible to achieve a society in which stratification and self-interest are not a part of the political or ideological equation. Everything that humanity does may be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to its instincts. We are animals. We make the supreme & egotistical mistake time and time again of forgetting our membership in this kingdom of beasts. Yes, we have an ability to rationalize that extends far beyond our animal brethren, but we, like they, are still slaves to our genetic urges. The only difference is that we have more chance of overcoming some of them than other animals do. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ We\\'ll start with stratification. Marx, in his manifesto, makes some very damning claims against the bourgeois class at the time, and blames Capitalism for a number of things: \"The bourgeoisie…has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his \"natural superiors,\" and has left no other bond between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous \"cash payment.\" It has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom--Free Trade.\" (http://www.marxists.org...) Unfortunately for Marx, this is largely unwarranted, since feudal, monarchical, dictatorial, and even \"communist\" systems have exhibited the same evils as a society that is operated by a free market. Materialism, therefore, cannot be blamed for the cold calculations of the wealthy against everyone else. Stratification, light or severe, can be found in every society on the planet, without exception. Something so universal, and something that existed long before the concept of Capitalism, must be to blame. Stratification, therefore, is much more likely due to human nature, even if it is a \"misfiring\" upper class amongst a sea of altruism. Even in the most peaceful societies in existence, some sort of social hierarchy is present. Just as in the rest of the animal kingdom, a chain of being exists naturally amongst humans. We can be compared to packs, prides, or flocks. A social theory that seeks to break apart our natural understanding of the world will inevitably fail, because people will inevitably gravitate toward this hierarchy. Now, it does not compute that this hierarchy must be bad. This is, perhaps, where humanity could learn something from men like Marx & Freire. A readjustment of how we perceive the hierarchy would probably lead to a far more peaceful existence than the power struggles we witness today. However, that\\'s not what Communism wants. It wants a full restructuring in that it wants an elimination of social structure, which would go against every societal instinct within the human condition. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, onto self-interest. I do not want my opponent to mischaracterize self-interest negatively right off the bat as selfishness. The two are distinct in that self-interest has a clear instinctual foundation. Every animal in the animal kingdom is concerned with its own survival. Granted, instinctually, we are all also concerned on some level with helping our species thrive, as well. This would be the altruistic side of our genetics. But, self-interest is undeniable. While we, unlike other animals, have the unique ability to interpret, weigh out, and even deny some instincts, we won\\'t categorically do this. Hence, any political theory that seeks to paint the human animal as something that it cannot physically be will fail monumentally, as it cannot account for even the smallest variations from the concept of blind equality. Adam Smith, expositor of capitalist theory and moral philosopher, characterizes a positive system of societal order as one which uses the instinct of self-interest to the benefit of the society. He says, in Wealth of Nations: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.\" While this may seem callous, it is not. It is merely a metacognitive examination of rhetoric which speaks to instincts, and seeks to manipulate our natural desire for self-preservation in order to benefit society as a whole. Adam Smith, of course, did not categorically apply this to all of society\\'s transactions. This quotation, as I said before, is merely an examination of more extreme rationale. Though not every member of society provides goods and services in order to self-serve, it is the butcher, baker, or brewer that is overly concerned with self-interest that Communism has no place for, but that would exist in the world even if it weren\\'t for Capitalist theory. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The gist of this analysis leads me to two final theoretical concerns regarding Communism: the tragedy of the commons and the oppressed turning oppressor. Tragedy of the commons, attributed to Garrett Hardin, claims that it only takes a handful of overly self-interested people to exploit the resources of a shared community, which then make it impossible for that community to survive. Hardin uses the example of a shared pasture for cattle grazing. A handful of farmers may agree to share this land, but if 1 of those farmers sneaks out into the middle of the night to graze his herd more out of self-interest, it will cost the community severely. Let\\'s pretend, for a moment, that self-interest is merely a fluke, an anomaly in the genetic world. Statistically, those who abuse others due to self-interest will find their way into these Communistic communities. After all, self-interest would compel you to reside with such altruistic people, for they are the easiest to exploit. Secondly, Paulo Freire describes the problem of the relationship between the oppressed and the oppressor. Quite readily, self-interest manifested turns to vengeful and retributive behavior. When a people has suffered to such a great extent, the psychological need for justice, for what is equitable, will make equilibrium nearly impossible to achieve. This need for retribution expresses itself in every justice system in the world, though some are more severe than others. The US and other first world nations have tempered retribution with a delicate and convoluted system of proportionality. In places like Rwanda, retribution is manifested in genocide. Either way, the oppressed, the victim, will generally require some sort of psychological or philosophical satisfaction that moves beyond simply removing power from an oppressor. The need for penalty or punishment is another universal human interest that my opponent will need to deal with on a biological level in order to convince us that Communism will succeed.', \"I appreciate my opponent's candor in RD 3, and hope to debate him again many times in the future. Enjoy the first 2 rounds, voters!\"]\n",
            "['My opponent asserts that Marx\\'s criticism and damning of the system is very specifically aimed at Capitalism. This, slightly, draws attention from the main point of Marx\\'s goal, and that is the elimination of the social conditionining of a need for a tangible reward for a service. This conditioning is seen in all systems of government my opponent has listed: traders in village markets in a Feudalistic society, etc. My opponent also claims that humans will naturally form hierarchies because we are animals; and since the rest of the animal kingdom does so, we, naturally, should as well. It is true that we are animals, only more rational and cognitive. Though, this does not mean that we should be inclined to form hierarchies to satisfy our apparent \\'instinct\\'. Though, to first address a big issue; is it an instinct? Or is it, just as greed is, a behavior learned from our environment? Humans, since the beginning of time, have used nature as a reference and resource to how to live and operate. Is it possible that somewhere along our timeline of social evolution, we observed the process of stratification in the Animal Kingdom and emulated the behavior? It wouldn\\'t be the first time this would happen. Many \\'human\\' behaviors and inventions have been inspired by nature: Business, Farming, Medicine, etc. In resolution, we, as humans, should use our gift of logic and reason, and be able to willfully transcend any inherent, or learned need to set others either superior or inferior. There is no excuse that someone can surmount to contradict this; except a personal testimony of their physical and mental inability to willfully overcome any tendency to need to be socially and monetarily rewarded greater than another, only because society has perceived their profession as more \\'important\\'. Is it so hard to restrain one\\'s self from needing a controlled currency, and to contribute to society with their ability and be given necessities? A misconception is that this will prevent people from attaining possessions that they want; this is simply untrue. Marx\\'s quote \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" doesn\\'t merely mean that you are only given your bare necessities and left at that. The quote is only a way for people to see anew, a type of life that would be truly altruistic. The only way for this type of civlilization to actually happen, is for people to learn; and this is done through the long and enduring, but rewarding, process of education. Not fascist, brainwashing education, as seen 1984, but true, non-regimented, open-minded education. ---------------- Now to address my opponent\\'s argument for self-interest. It is true that self-interest is not entirely selfish, as it is how we survive, and does not always lead to the misery of others to sustain our prosperity. But, where exactly does self interest exclude itself from a Communistic society? Look at it from this perspective. The butcher is good at his/her job and wishes to provide to society in the only way that he/she can, effectively. But, the butcher also wants to be able to have a home and the necessities, and pleasures, in life. Through self interest (as mentioned before, not selfishness), the butcher continues to do his/her job in order to be a positive member of the community, because they understand that if they do what they are skilled at doing, they will receive the desired necessities and simple pleasures of life. Self-interest needs not to be completely abolished in a Communistic society. In regards to the issue of the few rotten apples spoiling the bunch. .. Denying that there would be a presence of people unwilling to adapt to the philosophies in a Communistic society, would be ignorant. But as I said before when speaking about the issue of the learned behavior to stratify; education trumps all problems; maybe not completely, as perfection is impossible. But the waning of the greed ridden mindset that would trouble a Communistic society, wouldn\\'t be out of the question. Now, I\\'m NOT advocating that any persons not wishing to \\'assimilate\\' to this livelihood of the new society be discriminated against, or singled out for immediate attention (similar to what America has done with \\'failures\\' in the IQ system haha) and be \\'fixed\\', mentally. I\\'m only saying, that education, throughout a person\\'s life, would allow them the chance to understand that the old mindset of \"I work, and I receive the payment accredited, even if it is more than another\\'s\" is unnecessary and leads to nothing but conflict. My opponent then asserts that in the event that a Proletarian revolution occurs, the Proletariat will want blood in exchange for the oppression that they suffered at the hands of the Bourgeoisie. Although this has been seen many times in history whenever a major anarchical event has happened, this would not be the French Revolution. Although Marx did predict that some, if not most, of the worker\\'s revolutions would involve violence; he predicted this not for the reason of the worker\\'s hate for the Bourgeoisie, but, possibly, as a necessary measure to break free from the chains instituted by the elite class. Now, I may have initiated a mindset of \"He\\'s an anarchist and wants to overthrow everything! etc. . \"; but this is not my goal. I unequivocally believe that, like Dr. King\\'s peaceful civil rights movement, we can achieve an extreme change in our society, without violence and turmoil (By the Proletariat, the same cannot be said for the challenged Bourgeoisie). If a violent, vindictive revolution were to occur, it would be the antithesis of the entire point of a Marxist revolution; the point of which, is the equalization of all. Wouldn\\'t it be a complete and utter contradiction of the belief to punish others for their past \\'deeds\\', therefore placing them below those involved with the revolution, merely switching the roles of superiority, hence contradicting the main philosophy of the revolution? \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" - Karl Marx', 'The idea of Communism in this debate, is a society in which Bourgeoisie and Proletariat no longer exist, and only people, no longer identified through monetary or social value, are left. The idea of government (Government defined as a selective ruling body that decides how people should live; no matter how involved the citizens, it is defined as this) has been abolished. People dictate their own lives.', \"I misjudged how much I could handle, and spent too much time on one debate. And so, as a result, I will have to forfeit this debate, as well as another one in the process as well. Hopefully in the next few days, when I'm less busy, we can re open this debate, or even change sides for fun :D Please vote for my opponent, as I haven't been able to fully articulate my argument. , and she has put a lot of effort into this debate, and deserves the win.

            "['When Tommy took on the Gatlin boys, it is true that he could not undo the rape, nor could he instill guilt in people of such a brutish nature. However, he did show much more than the fact that he has the ability to punch people. He showed that he would no longer allow himself to be pushed around. That one act and the statement made by it could\\'ve quite possibly turned Tommy\\'s life around for the better. In this case and many others, the saying \"Action speaks louder than words\" is applicable. In my previous arguments, I have possibly been misconstrued. The fact that most wars were unnecessary does not indicate a concession on my part. I clearly stated in Round 1 \"Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them.\" My stance is not \"that all war is good for something.\" Rather, my stance is that war is good for MORE than absolutely nothing. There is a difference between these two views. Now when it comes to my examples of people fighting for their own self-defense, their dignity, and their honor, you ask \"What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive.\" But cannot the same things be said of the morals and compassion you mention? These too can be viewed as \"made up human concepts.\" If concepts such as these render an argument invalid, then your arguments stand to lose just as much validity as mine. You also claim that \"Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself.\" But when that self is multiplied by a large number, as was the case in Scotland, then a large section of humanity has been helped. In the section on intelligence, you say that people can still see that life is better than death. Even this may be debatable given some of the stupidity I\\'ve witnessed. Nevertheless, this is not what needs to be understood. The issue is whether or not the majority of people have the ability to see someone else\\'s perspective on a situation. Many people do not have this ability, and I do not believe that an unintelligent leader would either. George W. Bush is a leader that barely has the intelligence to comprehend a coloring book. Does it seem like he can understand the viewpoints of others? Mentioning the budget for the War on Terror can only speak against that war and others similar to it. It cannot serve to counter the rationale behind the wars I mentioned, which took place long before such budgets were associated with the act of war. (Note: I did check off that I\\'m in favor of The War on Terror in my profile, but this does not mean I agree with any of the budgets, policies, or methods used.) When it comes to the points on ignorance, you seem to think education can enlighten everyone. This is sadly not the case. I have been in countless classes where people would simply not understand a concept no matter how often it was repeated or how many times it was explained. Teaching acceptance of others also would not work. Oftentimes two opposing viewpoints are irreconcilable. If this were not the case, a site such as this could not exist. On your other point, I do realize that if both sides stop violence, then my self-defense reasoning does not apply. The problem is that even this is not as simple as it seems. You state \"Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end.\" But the dynamics involved in the beginnings of a war are rarely so cut and dry. What Riley from the Boondocks needs to understand is that there are situations in which neither side realizes that anything is starting until it is too late. Look at the current situation in the U.S. Rights are being taken away, but both the government and the majority of the citizens feel that it is justified. If and when the situation turns ugly, which side will it be that \"started\" something? The chain of events that can lead to war is highly complex, dependent upon many factors, and very dynamic. It is not one side slapping and the other defending. That is just a gross simplification. I have shown examples where war can be used as self-defense. But it may have another use. Namely, keeping the human population in check. For every species, there is a population limit. In biology this is known as the carrying capacity and is symbolized by the letter \"k.\" The current population is roughly 6.5 billion! What would it be without wars? It is possible that we would\\'ve reached the carrying capacity, and at that point mass deaths would\\'ve occurred. These totals would\\'ve been higher than the amount seen in war. Theoretically, most of the population is wiped out. So wars are good for both population control and self-defense. Having both of these uses, they can definitely been seen as good for more than absolutely nothing. To Darth_Grievous_42: I too thought this was a good debate. You presented some excellent arguments that kept me on my toes. And to satisfy your curiosity, my picture is the cover of the Pink Floyd album Meddle.', 'Coward Of The County by Kenny Rogers Everyone considered him the coward of the county. He\\'d never stood one single time to prove the county wrong. His mama named him Tommy, the folks just called him yellow, But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong. He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison. I looked after Tommy \\'cause he was my brothers son. I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy: \"Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun. Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man.\" Theres someone for everyone and Tommy\\'s love was Becky. In her arms he didnt have to prove he was a man. One day while he was workin the Gatlin boys came callin. They took turns at Becky.... there was three of them! Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin. The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand. He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy\\'s picture. As his tears fell on his daddys face, he heard these words again: Promise me, son, not to do the things I\\'ve done. Walk away from trouble if you can. It wont mean you\\'re weak if you turn the other cheek. I hope youre old enough to understand: Son, you dont have to fight to be a man. The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom. One of them got up and met him halfway cross the floor. When Tommy turned around they said, \"Hey look! old yeller\\'s leavin.\" But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door. Twenty years of crawlin was bottled up inside him. He wasn\\'t holdin nothin back; he let \\'em have it all. When Tommy left the barroom not a Gatlin boy was standin. He said, \"This one\\'s for Becky,\" as he watched the last one fall. And I heard him say, I promised you, dad, not to do the things you\\'d done. I walk away from trouble when I can. Now please dont think Im weak, I didnt turn the other cheek, And papa, I sure hope you understand: Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man. Everyone considered him the coward of the county. Although this applies only to one individual, many of the conflicts previously mentioned could be analagous. After all, what was the conflict in Scotland during the late 13th and early 14th centuries if not a case of the Gatlin boys picking on someone? The only difference is that there were larger numbers on both sides. Even the rape of Becky took place in the form of prima nocte. I have read through your arguments, and I suppose the main problem I have with them is your over-optimistic viewpoints. Of course if there are two viable options: one being war and the other being a logical discussion to work out the differences, the discussion is to be preferred. The problem is that there are many people that do not have the intellectual capacity to discuss things or to bother to try and understand an opposing viewpoint. When you state \"Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past\" I must ask what the \\'us\\' refers to. If it refers to you and I, then you are correct. But if it refers to the human population in general, I beg to differ. Despite the many claims you may hear about humans being a superior species, I can assure you that most humans are actually quite lacking in intelligence. Not only are there many that cannot see the mistakes of the past, they will almost certainly repeat those same mistakes in the future. You say \"All the examples you have stated so far are all situations [where] reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine.\" Is this really true? Do you really believe that the Scots could\\'ve said \"Hey wait! Let\\'s talk this out nicely.\"? Even if they could, would you want to resolve the issue with a nice discussion after somebody had just raped your wife? Of course they would claim that it was a legal right, but this it is still unacceptable. As the penultimate line of Coward of the County states: \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man.\" My main point is that reason and understanding cannot be implanted into the minds of others. When you state \"The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory\" you are absolutely correct. They shouldn\\'t have done these things. The problem is they did. If a child decides to stick up for himself and hit a bully back after the bully starts with him, the child that fought back cannot be condemned. Of course anyone can still make the correct statement \"The bully should\\'ve never started with him in the first place.\" This is true, but it is what bullies do. Similarly, when the British invade Zulu territory, the Zulus cannot be condemned for starting the Anglo-Zulu war. Did the war have to be fought? No. But that doesn\\'t make it wrong. The child could\\'ve let the bully pick on him and avoid a fight as well. But letting issues get resolved through such passive action is not good. People should have the right to defend themselves. You claim \"Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death.\" This is not the case. There are a great many people in this world that will not be affected by words. They either won\\'t care or they won\\'t have the intelligence to understand them. I know this may seem like an extremely uncivilized and savage claim, but bullets, missiles and bombs are the only reasoning that many of these brutes will understand. As unsophisticated as this may sound, it is sadly the truth. I don\\'t have the space to reiterate all of the lyrics to War and go through them all once more, but there are a few other points I\\'d like to make concerning some of them. \"Who wants to die?\" You claim that it is only an escape for a temporary situation. But an excellent point is made in the movie V for Vendetta. When the character V tortures Natalie Portman he shows her that death is actually not the worst thing. There are some principles that exist that are worth dying for. This ultimate realization came to her, as it did to V at the end of the movie. He knew that he would die on that final night, and yet that paled in comparison to his goal of changing the corrupt government and giving hope to the other citizens. You ask \"Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice?\" Perhaps if they could, but this is an impossibility. The point of many of these sacrifices is that the principle was worth more than life. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" To this you state \"Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past.\" Now this may be true, but not realistic. Brains cannot be instilled in those that are not learned. Your view is extremely optimistic, but in reality a leopard cannot fully change its spots. Those without brains will never become intellectual. And when these unintellectual brutes start trouble, no amount of compassion or brain can persuade them. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" You say to me \"You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy.\" Once again, the intelligence needed to reach a conclusion through diplomacy is not present. It would\\'ve been better, but it simply cannot happen. You also say in reference to this \"The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step?\" I\\'ll tell you why they couldn\\'t skip a step. It is not that it was physically impossible. It is that it was impossible in terms of the mental capacity required for such acts. I have no space left, but my main point is that your optimistic views are not realistic.', 'This is a very original and highly amusing means of presenting an argument. I commend you on your creativity. I will first begin by showing that war may sometimes be necessary. From there I will use examples to show that it is good for more than absolutely nothing. After the basis of my argument has been laid out, I can address all of the points in the song lyrics. Although war is often construed as a means of destruction, it can in many cases be a means of liberation. A brief look at history can show examples where war served as the only means of obtaining freedom. Take Scotland in the late 13th and early 14th centuries for example. The Scots were constantly being tyrannized by the British and were subjected to many injustices. Although the movie Braveheart dramatized and perhaps exaggerated some of the details, atrocities such as prima nocte really did occur. Another example can be seen in the Anglo-Zulu war. The British invaded the territory of the Zulus, and the Zulus decided to go to war and die rather than allow others to take over their land. This may seem pointless to you, but many would consider it brave and noble. The Zulus with primitive weapons actually defeated the British in the Battle of Isandlwana, and although many died, they died nobly. I know that in the end the Zulus lost the war, but this does not mean that people should allow invaders to take over without consequence. One more example to mention is the French Revolution. Things were so bad with unemployment, malnutrition, and even famine that people literally had to fight for their lives. Death was going to come anyway. Should it come by means of slow and torturous starvation, or should it come through a revolution that could possibly pave the road for change? In cases such as these, war can be seen as a means of self-defense. Now to address the points highlighted in the song. \"Because it means destruction Of innocent lives\" In the cases I mentioned, many innocent lives were already being destroyed. Even in cases where death is not the means of destruction, the constant tyrannical oppressions that make life unbearable can be viewed as a way of sucking the life out of innocent people. When such is the case, rising up to fight for self-preservation becomes more noble than allowing the injustices to continue. \"War means tears To thousands of mothers eyes When their sons go to fight And lose their lives\" I have no doubt that this is true. But when tears are welling up in the eyes of not only mothers, but entire populations yearning for justice, then the tears shed for those who died fighting the good fight pale in comparison. \"War, it ain\\'t nothing But a heartbreaker\" For oppressed populations, war can actually be heartlifting rather than heartbreaking. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" It is also a friend to those who have been freed by it. In fact, even corrupt coalitions that start wars to take over land may still view war as their friend if they come out victorious. They may not be good people, but it still serves to show that war is not friend ONLY to the undertaker. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" See the previous rebuttal. Not all mankind views war as an enemy. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Many wars probably are rather pointless. But not all of them. There can be a very good point to starting a war. Allowing others to steamroll over you cannot be considered a valid alternative to war. \"War has caused unrest Within the younger generation\" War has done more than this. It has very likely caused unrest with people of every generation. But this cannot be used to condemn the wars previously mentioned. These people were already in a state of unrest. \"Induction then destruction\" The destruction point was previously addressed. Being inducted into a war and then destroyed is probably better than sitting and waiting for destruction to come. \"Who wants to die?\" Those with extreme suffering often choose death as a means of escape. When it comes to the oppressed, a voluntary death may be better than a life of suffering. \"Ooooh, war, has shattered Many a young mans dreams Made him disabled, bitter and mean\" I cannot contend that war has left many people disabled. This is a sad tragedy. But the bitterness is probably much more present when the disabled view the war as pointless. Many (perhaps most) wars are pointless...but not all. \"Life is much to short and precious To spend fighting wars these days\" The words \\'these days\\' seem to refer to the present. I must say that in the present day I have often felt that we may actually have to fight another revolutionary war within our own country. Atrocities such as the Patriot Act are taking away the very freedoms that made this country so great. And as the grip gets tighter and tighter, it may only be a matter of time before both you and I must choose whether to live under a dictatorship or rise up and fight. \"War can\\'t give life It can only take it away\" Is this really true? Cannot it not be said that the Treaty of Edinburgh (the end result of the conflict between Scotland and Britain) gave life to the subsequent generations of Scotland? In the French Revolution, war gave life to some who would\\'ve died of famine. \"Peace, love and understanding Tell me, is there no place for them today?\" There certainly should be a place for them. But it is impossible to have all people of all nations on the same wavelength. Consequently, many people that only wish for peace can sometimes find themselves in a situation where war becomes the lesser evil. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom But Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" I\\'ve been arguing a similar point. If there is a Lord that does know a better way, he certainly hasn\\'t informed anyone of what this is. In fact, there are many biblical accounts in which the Lord supposedly helped one side defeat another in battle. So even for those that choose to believe in some omnipotent force, a better way has yet to be revealed. My main point is that war is good for more than absolutely nothing. It is good for obtaining freedom from all types of oppression and invasion. It may even have further uses that I will explore in later rounds.']\n",
            "['Ah, you found a rebuttal song. Very nice. Well, what exactly was it that Tommy achieved by beating up the Gatlin boys? Did he take the rape back magically? Did the boys feel bad about what they did? Did he prove he was a man? No, he accomplished none of these things, all he did was show he could punch people. That\\'s about it. After reading your last round it seems you completely agree with me that war should be avoided. So then you concede this debate? Your stance is that all war is good for something. But in this last round you\\'ve taken the stance that \"war should be avoided, but it just won\\'t\". I cannot deny that what was done in the past was done and served a purpose. I can\\'t deny that wars will continue to happen due to lack of human intelligence. But that is not the case I am making. I am saying it could have and should have never happened in the first place. There is potential for us all to come to terms peacefully, and while there is that possibility there is reality. My views are optimistically realistic. I can see the better parts of man and know that we can do it. So none of my claims are preposterous, just highly unlikely. As far as they can apply to the real world I know that they will probably never come into action in the real world. But again, this is not my stance. My stance is about what should and could happen. That is what War is singing about. He is not saying war will never happen, he\\'s jus saying they shouldn\\'t. On this point it seems you agree with me, thus making my stance victorious. But now to discuss your point that they have no ability to ever stop. In summary, it seems your concerns are: Honor, intelligence, ignorance and one sided-ness. Honor: In concerns to the Scot and Tommy. What real good is honor? Honor cannot feed you. Honor will not help you walk. Honor will not keep you alive. Honor is a made up human concept, and can easily be restored with counseling. The only judge on honor is yourself, no one and nothing else\\'s. So, is fighting a war based on rape a good idea? Does it make the war just? No, it does not. It would still have been better for the Scots to have engaged in a peaceful negotiation. It would have been better for Tommy to call on the cops and let them suffer in a concrete room. The only accomplishment they made was gaining revenge, another self induced concept. Neither honor nor revenge will help humanity, only yourself. So this is not a good reason to continue fighting wars. SO your lyric should not read \"Sometimes you gotta fight when you\\'re a man\", but rather \\'Sometimes you wanna fight when your a man\\'. Intelligence: You claim that people, both now and then, do not have the mental capacity to settle things peacefully. This is half-true, I can\\'t deny that. Never the less, they still have some modicum of intelligence to see that life is better than death. So even in the most unintelligent leader, they still have the ability, just not the will. It is still not an excuse, only an observation. But we all do have the ability to raise the intelligence of man kind, low as it is today. The budget on the War on Terror currently is in the trillions. Do you have any idea how many new schools could be constructed with that financing. I\\'m not talking about a lot of little \\'podunk\\' badly constructed schools. This kind of money could build thousands of university level institutions. It could re-furnish every American school twice over with new books, new desks, new computers, new everything with cash to spare. Yet it all goes to bullets, bombs, missiles and the things that fire them. All of these are good to only use a few times, but a school can last generations. So intelligence is not totally out of the question. Yes, right now human brain poser is less than satisfactory. True, the mental states of people in the past were less than a modern middle schooler. Yet we in the here and now have the ability to stop further destruction. We can teach those who will live beyond us the folly\\'s of the past, and make war nothing more than a definition in a text book they will read. So low intelligence is not an excuse either, only an obstacle. Ignorance: True, there are some people who will not change their blood thirsty ideals until they\\'ve been released of their own mortal coil. But that can all be solved with education, as stated above. People only know as much as they are taught. Right now, people are being taught to distrust their fellow man. They learn that they \\'other side\\' only wants you dead, and that you need to wan them dead more to stay alive. People just need to start teaching acceptance of \\'the enemy\\', because once your enemy is your friend, you have no enemies to fight against. Because this can also be avoided, this is also not a reason why wars should be fought. One sided-ness: A misconception you seem to have is that only one side should turn the other cheek while the other will continue to slap. This is not what I am saying. Both sides need to stop the violence, and can. War is a double edged sword. You cannot just sheath one side for it to no longer be a threat. Both sides must go into sheath. Both sides have the capabilities to stop war, thus both are accountable. Starting a war mainly falls upon 1 side, but it ends up being both in the end. Both sides need to stop war before it happens. As Riley of the Boondocks once said: If you don\\'t start nothing, there won\\'t be nothing. The same is true when it comes to war. In V for Vendetta, the British Government shouldn\\'t have take the peoples rights, and Evy wouldn\\'t have needed to be tortured by V because V would have nothing to fight against. My stance is that wars are good for absolutely nothing. I have proved that to be true. We can avoid war. Because we can we should. Continuing to do so just idiotic. There is no dispute that can only be settled with violence, people only think it is. Every obstacle can be overcome with learning, with understanding, with compassion. It is not mere optimism that fuels what I say, its the examination of other, more profitable routes we can take. My stance isn\\'t just a sermon, it is a presentation of possibilities and facts. Basically a science. There is as much realism to my points as there was for the idea\\'s of flight and electricity. Right now, war is equivalent to the ideas that the only manner\\'s of transportation will ever be horse drawn buggies and that candle light is the only way to see in the dark. The only difference, and I do mean the only, is that instead of one man making this brilliant proposition and then the world accepts it is that everyone in the world must be apart of the proposition and accept it. War is a global disease, and must be handled on a global level. Undeniably war has happened. Undeniably it has had some positive effects. But in every case it did not need to be settled by war and could have been solved with non-deadly words. Thus war has never accomplished anything that couldn\\'t have been done some other way. Therefore they are good for absolutely nothing. To GaryBacon: Good debate. You\\'ve challenged me with your historical knowledge. I\\'m also impressed with your V for Vendetta analogy.

To the audience: I\\'ll remind you that your voting is not determined by what stance you prefer but which side proved theirs better, be it mine or GaryBacon\\'s. If you feel the need to justify your anonymous vote you can do so in the comments area. Darth_Grievous_42 out.', 'Well thank you for that compliment. I must agree with Logical-Master, and I too would have been quite amused if you had found a rebuttal song. But back on subject. On Necessity: While I cannot refute that wars have served a purpose, I have to disagree that that makes them necessary. What happened to politics? Is it always necessary to result to fisticuffs when you don\\'t get your way? Is there no way that talking it through could not have solved anything? You might say no but I say yes. What you will say is that nothing would have been accomplished. The French would still be poverty. Scots would never have had freedom. Zulus would have lost their land. That is, of course, assuming both sides had engaged in combat. Hindsight shows us the mistakes of the past. The aristocracy of France should just have let the lower class into their political system. The British shouldn\\'t have invaded Scotland or Zulu territory. We can see it now, why couldn\\'t they? Did it really take all those lives, all the wounds, all the nightmares to figure that out? The truth is they could have without war, but were blinded by the manipulations of their past. The common law was if you needed something take it, by any means necessary. Everybody viewed everybody as an enemy, as something less than themselves, as different. But really, are we different at all? Did the Zulu\\'s not have 5 fingers on their hands like the British? Didn\\'t the British have two legs like the Zulu\\'s? Didn\\'t both sides of the French have kidneys, Livers, Lower Intestine, Bladders, Femurs, Molars, Eyebrows, Rib cages, etc? Was there no possible way that neither side could see that? Why neither could treat the other as friend rather than foe? All the examples you have stated so far are all situations were reason and understanding could have just as well have prevailed over the gun, spear, and guillotine. Its wasn\\'t self defence, it was close minded fear. People wanted results fast, not results right. Either way it could have reached the same outcome. So again, what was the use of war? \"Because it means destruction of innocent lives\" You claim that people have to fight to better there lives. Well, as I just pointed out, all it would take is reason and even the strife could have been avoided. The poor conditions of the people were caused by ignorance, and selfishness of those in power. With enough political involvement, these tyrants could have been userbed without deadly force. With a bit of consciousness, peoples lives could be better. Again, human stupidity stalls that. So another case were it could have been avoided, but rather than efficiency, people wanted speed and money. So these lives were still lost needlessly. \"War means tears to thousands of mothers eyes when their sons go to fight and lose their lives\" Can there really be any good fight? Its not just one mother, its thousands, even millions, and not just those on the \"good\" side but on the other as well (a good exemplification of this is the film \\'All Quiet on the Western Front\\') To both sides, their \\'good\\' fight is the bad one for the opposition. Many don\\'t even know why they are fighting, they just are. Especially when a draft comes into effect, and people who would rather not fight, die for a cause they didn\\'t support or did not want to get involved in. Do you still think \\'the good fight\\' would matter to those mothers? \"War, it ain\\'t nothing but a heart breaker\" War is still a heart breaker, even to the oppressed. No sane person smiles when they hear of a loved ones death on the battlefield, even if it was for a cause. A cause which could be solved with diplomacy. \"War, friend only to the undertaker\" Couldn\\'t those corrupt coalitionists be seen as undertakers? Profiting off the dead? I believe War meant \\'undertaker\\' as general statement. But there is no doubt that war must be a happy time for funeral businesses. \"It\\'s an enemy to all mankind\" Incorrect. All mankind view war as an enemy. What people like is the \\'reasons\\' behind the wars. War is an enemy to the human race. It\\'s purposeful self destruction of our species, aka, murder. We are legally endorsing the job that we condemn people like Charles Mason and Timothy McVeigh for doing. A B52 pilot can easily beat the damage done in the Oklahoma City Bombing. A Marine can kill ten times more than Charles Mason. Why is it that no one else seems to see that war=murder. That is War is saying. We are killing ourselves. Reasons be damned. Any issue can be resolved with words, yet we still resort to death. Without the reasoning its still murder. And because the reasoning can be resolved some other way. So we are killing ourselves needlessly! War is an enemy to everyone, no matter what story you tell yourself to sleep at night. \"The point of war blows my mind\" Give me a good reason to start a war. This means that reason could not, in any way, be resolved peacefully. There would have to be a good, legitimate reason that would progress mankind. There cannot be any ill will, or vengeful motivation behind it. All of these are in direct conflict with what war really is. But if you can find me 1 \\'good\\' war I will concede this point. I would suggest trying to find a few, as I\\'m sure I will be able to knock them down easily. \"War has caused unrest within the younger generation\" War messes everybody up. The father of a son dies. The sun wells up hatred. That son becomes a world leader, and declares war. That war kills another dad, with another son, and the cycle continues. War only fuels distrust, hatred, and revenge. It hinders progress because it scars people, physically, mentally and emotionally. The only reason its still alive is because we keep it alive, and say it\\'s right. Patriotism is just a nice sound way of saying \"I will kill anyone for this dirt\". Allegiance and loyalty are just the politically correct term of saying \"I don\\'t trust my fellow man\". War is bad, and always will be. \"Induction then destruction\" Destruction is always bad. It means death. Many people view death as being a bad thing. Again, diplomacy can spare us all the trouble. \"Who wants to die?\" An escape for a temporary situation. Nothing that can\\'t be solved with reason. In fact, many survivors of suicide come to that same realization. Life is precious, why stop it prematurely? I\\'m sure if we could talk to those dead in wars they would say the exact same thing. Beside, wouldn\\'t they prefer to see the effects of their sacrifice? \"Ooooh, war, has shattered many a young mans dreams, made him disabled, bitter and mean\" So you concede to this point for the most part. Every surviving soldier I have met from a war is haunted with bad dreams and memories. Those with disabilities are loathsome of the cause. They lost their hand because two leaders could not shake theirs. Truly a waste. \"Life is much to short and precious to spend fighting wars these days\" Again, without the distrust, with a little brains rather than brawn, with compassion, we would never have had to fight the wars of the past. If we do fight any in the future (undoubtedly we will) it will only be because we still haven\\'t realized this fact. \"War can\\'t give life it can only take it away\" The opposite of war isn\\'t peace, it\\'s creation. Wars destroy, people create. You\\'ve only viewed the outcomes of the wars, but those all could have been reached with diplomacy. The acts and treaties came after all the death. Why not skip a step? \"Peace, love and understanding tell me, is there no place for them today?\" But war is still evil, yes? What would be so wrong about getting people to understand each other? It would take time, perhaps some harsh words here and there, but any positive result that doesn\\'t require a gun is worth looking into. \"They say we must fight to keep our freedom but Lord knows there\\'s got to be a better way\" Diplomacy. Education. Reason. Understanding. LOVE. Just a thought. 22 Characters left.', 'As Pro, I am going to be defending that war (the fighting killing kind) is good for absolutly nothing.

There are laws to regulate government agencies to keep their power in check at a certain amount or laws to maintain how ethical their actions are. Governments uphold laws in ways such that the unalienable rights of people are not violated and government corporations that do break laws are liable to penalties because the government is not all powerful and immune. That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass, they do not use intimidation and violence as law enforcement, and because things such as taxes are involuntary but are accepted as necessary evils by people.

When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\"\"Ok then allow me to rephrase. Governments establish that it cannot violate the rights of people. The Mafia does not do that. Therefore a government is not a criminal organization since it establishes that a persons rights cannot be violated. - Consequences for violating laws - \" If you give it to me and I don\\'t shoot you, is it then OK? \"Youve made the correct choice in that scenario, however as stated above, the Government can only give you choices for punishment that do not violate a persons established right, the Mafia doesnt do that.

A government cannot use extreme measures of force because peoples rights defend from that, however to criminal organizations rights dont mean anything and there is an unlimited range of force they can use. Therefore Governments are not criminal organizations since the range of force a government can use against its people through law enforcement is limited, whereas for criminal organizations, it is not. - Legitimacy to collect taxes - \"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money\"Once again, people dont recognize the mafia as the legal entity that can collect taxes, the government though is.

Fictional or not']\n",
            "['I will be using the term \"corporation\" to refer to organizations and institutions which may or may not meet the criteria of \"government\", as the term \"corporation\" literally means a \"body of people\". This can include any type of corporation - municipalities, nation-states, for-profit, non-profit, state-chartered, etc... (ie, all governments are corporations, but not all corporations are governments). This is to more easily compare institutions which do not meet the definitions above, and to clearly demonstrate the myth of legitimacy, and the problem with arbitrary exemptions. Also, If you have an example of a corporation which meets the criteria provided, please provide these examples in the early rounds, so that I may address them. At the very least, I would request that no examples be provided in the last round, as that would not leave me the opportunity to address anything I find to be incorrect.Please do not confuse \"society\" with \"government\". Before I begin, I would like to state that I accept the necessity of society, community, and of many of the services that these corporations labeled as \"government\" provide. If a corporation issues a \"law\", it is making a rule and promoting the obedience of that rule with \"law enforcement\" (both attributes are listed in the definition of government that we have accepted for this debate). Law enforcement is the use of violence and intimidation in the pursuit of the goal of obedience. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:The use of violence an intimidation, without arbitrary exemptions, is the core principle behind criminal law. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression.If a corporation claims a \"monopoly right over a geographic area\", it is claiming that, on some level, it \"owns\" the land, and, if you move past a claimed boundary on the earth, the corporation claims the \"right\" to use the above-mentioned violence and intimidation in the pursuit of its goals. We can also not call being born into a geographical area as \"consent\" or acceptance of the legitimacy of that claim any more than being born into slavery is consent to being a slave.The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:Claiming a monopoly right is inherently an exemption. It is the statement that the corporation can engage in X, but any other corporation who engages in X on their \"turf\" is subject to the same violence and intimidation described earlier. To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting violence and aggression, racketeering, or uphold the property rights of individuals.If a corporation collects \"taxes\", we must assume that it is not voluntary. Any \"voluntary\" payment of services would simply be called a payment, and any \"voluntary\" contribution to society would simply be called \"charity\". Taxation is based exclusively on where you reside or do business, ie, if you reside or do business within the geographic area that the institution claim, this amounts to \"tacit consent\" (ie, not consensual) to pay for products and services. We can not accept this as \"voluntary\" because people choose to stay in that geographic region any more than we can accept the Mafia\\'s collection of \"protection money\" as voluntary simply because a shopkeeper chooses not to move out of the neighborhood. The contradiction and arbitrary exemption:To take, under threat of force, the product of somebody else\\'s labor, against their consent is \"theft\". To prove the statement \"All Governments are Criminal Institutions\" to be wrong, you must find a government which does not have laws prohibiting theft.The myth of legitimacy and the paradox of exemption:The core difference between \\'government\\' corporations and other corporations is the idea that these claims are somehow \"legitimate\", ie, that other corporations can not do these things without being in violation of the law, but institutions which are perceived as \\'legitimate\", or labeled as \"government\", can do these things without being in violation of the law. The myth of \"legitimacy\" is itself an example of \"arbitrary exemptions\". In essence, it is a matter of faith. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to use violence against you or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has the legitimate right to take the product of your labor against your will or you do not. You either believe that a corporation has a legitimate claim to a geographical area or you do not, but the claim itself does not make it true, and the fact that this belief is held by so many also does not make it true (democracy itself is an appeal to the ad populum fallacy).In fact, faith is REQUIRED to accept such corporations as legitimate, because, as I have demonstrated, the attributes of these corporations are inherently inconsistent (ie, self-contradictory), and a concept must, at the very least, be internally consistent for it to qualify as \\'legitimate\\'.', 'This argument contains definitions which clarify my position. If you provide an example of a corporation, agency, institution or other body which does not meet the below criteria (ei, at least one of the three attributes listed are not present), or define \"crime\" as excplicitly including \"arbitrary exemptions\" (ie, a \"law\" that allows the state to violate other laws), then you are arguing against a straw man, EVEN IF such institution is accepted as a \"government\" using OTHER CRITERIA. When I am using the word \"government\", I am describing any number of institutions, with variations in size, scope, complexity, culture, laws, and location. However, I assert that all of these institutions have very specific characteristics in common, which I will sum up into three behavioral attributes: The creation of Laws and Law enforcement. The claim of monopoly rights over a geographic area. The collection of taxes. While there are many variations of structure and organization of such institutions, I will use these attributes to define government. Something labeled a \"government\" may not meet this criteria, and is therefor exempt from this . I define \"Criminal Organization\" as any organization which inherently commits crimes. Here, \"crime\" means a violation of applicable criminal law (if applied consistently to all moral actors regardless of arbitrary exemptions giving members of that organization the exclusive right to commit such crime). I contend that it is axiomatic - that the very same attributes which I here use to define a government are crimes, even within the scope of the very same laws that same government provides and enforces, and that arbitrary excemptions are necessary to cover up this obvious inconsistency.', 'For this round, will simply test con\\'s arguments out by using the same arguments for a known criminal institution as a baseline - the question is \"does the same line of argument justify the actions of the mafia?\". Since we know the actions of the mafia are not justifible or legitimate, we can assume any argument which justfies or legitimizes the criminal actions of the mafia are not valid. For this thought experiment, I will assume that the mob boss makes sizable donations to the orphanage he was raised in. Think of the orphans\"First off a law is a law and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the governments.\" First off a mob boss\\'s rules are the rules and if you break it then that is your own damn fault not the mafia\\'s. You must first assume that the rules are legitimate before you can assume that the violence used to enforce those rules is justified. This is circular reasoning.\"criminal organizations dont give people rights\"Neither do governments. When a government \"gives\" you a right, it is simply establishing that it can not legally violate that particular \"right\", buy any right that isn\\'t codified is on the table, hence the state violating your property rights and rights of movement.\\'Yeah if asking nicely and giving you an option to choose youre own fate is counted as violence\\'If the mafia asks you nicely and gives you an option to choose whether you pay protection, aren\\'t you choosing you\\'re own fate? If I point a gun to your head and demand your wallet, and you give it to me, I\\'m giving you a choice, right? If you give it to me and I don\\'t shoot you, is it then OK? It\\'s not a \"violent\" or \"coercive\" act if I don\\'t shoot you?\"The reason they can deny you access is if youre a smuggler or a criminal or someone wanted for committing a crime. If youre not a criminal or a smuggler then youre allowed to go around anywhere.\"Stating a motivation is not justification for the act they are motivated to do, even if that motivation is \"good\". The reason the mob can kick you out of the ciy is if you\\'re a trouble-maker. If you don\\'t make any trouble, and keep your nose clean, you don\\'t got nothing to worry about.\"You cannot assume that [all governments are criminal organizations] just because 1 might qualify that all others do qualify.\"Like I said before, based on the definition of \\'crime\\', exluding any exeptions, all governments, as defined in this argument, are, de-facto, criminal organizations. It is axiomatic, like saying \"all apples are fruits\", and defining an apple as a \"fruit which grows on an apple tree\". The criteria for criminality explicitly includes the qualities specifically defined in government.\"You have yet to give proof that they are indeed criminal organizations.\"If these fictional governments have fictional laws which are enforced with fictional law enforcement and claim a monopoly over fictional geographic regions and collect fictional taxes, then they are fictional criminal organizations, unless you define \"crime\" as \"not crime\" or \"not crime when fictional governments do it\".\"Law enforcement still acknowledges that people have rights, that law enforcement is limited in how they treat people, and that law enforcement lives by codes and laws that they have to obey.\"The mob knows that people deserve respect, and there are certain things that they just won\\'t do. You treat them right, and they\\'ll treat you right. There\\'s even \"honor among theves\".\"for a government to work it needs taxes\"For a extortion racket to work, we need to collect the protection money. Think of the orphans.\"you have still not offered evidence showing that each and every one of these are criminal organizations. \"You are shifting the onus. In essence, you are stating that I must deliver an infinite number of counter-arguments to these examples. You are doing this because, I suspect, you don\\'t understand the axiomatic nature of my argument. My argument works with all possible governments in all possible universes, as long as they meet the criteria.You have asserted several times that I have offered \"no proof\" that governments are criminal organizations. To say this is to miss the point etirely. If I say that all apples are fruits and define apple as a fruit, then, yes, ALL apples are fruits, definately and definitively. You are saying that there are fictional apples, and put the onus on me to prove that all fictional apples are fruits, when you ignore the definition of \"apple\" stated to avoid exactly that kind of confusion.The rest of your argument is a repetition of the same points - \"yeah, but...\". Yeah, but governments pay for good things. Yeah, but governments punish bad people. Yeah, but governments give us free goodies. Yeah, but governments protect us from evil warlords. This may all be entirely true, but it is also irrelevant, as I am not saying that providing these services is a criminal act any more than the mob boss giving money to an orphanage is a criminal act. It\\'s not what they do with their money and power (most of the time), it\\'s how they get the money, and how they keep their power. You also choose to argue against some of my rhetorical statements I made during the round you forfieted. I could engage in those extraneous argument, but it would take too long and detract from the point.Your final diatribe against anarchism is an ad hominum attack. Yes, I\\'m an \"anarchist\" because I don\\'t believe in morally justifiable INITIATIONS of force. Just calling me an \"anarchist\" is a de-facto straw man since you obviously have a misunderstanding of my position, so can not possibly address my arguments which defend them. I could be a satanist, child-molesting drug-dealing murderous psychopath, but that wouldn\\'t change the substance of my argument.\"Governments give people rights\"Rights are \"unalienable\". They do not come from government. Government, if anything. codifies and (alegedly) protects some rights at the expense of violation other rights\".\"Governments acknowledge people\\'s property rights\"Government can not protect your property by taking it by force.\"Governments provide services to its people\"Not nearly as many services as the free market does.\"Governments puts criminals, murderers, and rapists in jail\"Success rate is about 10% in the US. US government also murders people in brutal wars, and uses the fear of rape to gain your obedience.\"Governments fund jails to keep criminals in\"It also defines what a \"criminal\" is, and can put you in jail for not obeying it.\"Governments acknowledge the right to bear arms, Anarchies dont\"That is the exact opposite of the truth, much like many other things you\\'ve said. Here\\'s the thing, If you were born in a hospital, been to a hospital, seen a dentist, or gone to a school, then the government has spent money on you.... So the government does spend money on EVERYONE', 'When the world was confronted with the observations of Copernicus, and the theories of a heliocentric solar system, it was a dramatic shock to the existing world view that the entire world would be fundamentally different than what people had accepted for centuries.When the world was confronted with the protestant movement, it was a dramatic charge that the \"one true faith\" could be called into question, that alternatives to such a ubiquitous and powerful institution could be created simply by asking those questions, and formulating alternative answers.When the world was confronted with abolitionists, it was a dramatic realization that slavery was wrong, yet some stuck to their existing perceptions, and ignored the obvious immorality of the institution.When the world was confronted with the woman\\'s suffrage movement, it was a dramatic and scary thought to some that women be given the same rights as men.When the world was confronted with such scientific breakthroughs as the theory of evolution, or Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, it was a dramatic paradigm shift, which left many people dazed and confused.Yet, we all accept that these things were correct, and the dominant paradigms of the time were wrong. We all accept that truth marches on, and that the future MUST, as well, be filled with surprising revelations about the ideas and institutions we take for granted.Is it really hard to accept that the next to be called into question is the dominant institution of our day? Is it really that far of a stretch to think that institutions (governments) which killed nearly 300 million people in the 20th century may not be rational? Is it really hard to accept that using an institution which steals nearly half the nation\\'s income is not a good strategy for protecting property rights? Is it hard to figure out that the more soldiers \"fight for our freedom\", the less freedom we actually have, as measured by the massive amount of legislation coming out of Washington, from SOPA and PIPA to the NDAA and the Patriot Act?We can either choose to be on the right side of history, or we can choose to indulge in the delusion that the status quo is always correct - a delusion that, history has shown, will almost always be wrong.', '\"law enforcement coming from the government comes in the forms of fines, penalties, and maybe an arrest if the crimes are severe enough.\"There are many different forms of \"punishment\" for non-obedience, up to and including being shot. The violence, however, tends to show itself clearly only when the other intimidation techniques don\\'t achieve the objective of your obedience. In the US, for instance, you may get a fine, but that fine is essentially an extortion notice, and is itself an act of intimidation. You must pay, or else. If you do not pay that fine, they can increase the intimidation. For instance, they can send you a court date, which is to say, they can demand that you appear before them. If you do not show up, they can issue a warrant for your arrest, which is to say, they create a document which \"authorizes\" somebody to abduct you against your will. Even that is nice language meant to play down what actually happens, as the truth, at least in the US, is that men with guns come to your house, tie you up in metal shackles, throw you in a vehicle, many times a windowless van, and toss you in a cage that is famous for being a place where you will be beaten and raped*.If you defend yourself from this horrific threat of abduction and prison rape, you will be shot - murdered, slaughtered, executed, put down like a pig, and the only \"crimes\" you committed were disobedience and self-defense.\"law enforcement doesn\\'t come from violence and intimidation\"Law enforcement IS violence and intimidation, and it is explicitly so. There are plenty of justifications for this violence and intimidation, (ie, claiming that it is a \"necessary evil\"), but saying they have nothing to do with each other is like saying war has nothing to do with killing people. Not only is it not true, it is the exact opposite of truth. \"You are allowed to move beyond boundaries between governments though, they are called passports and it happens all the time. \"You are contradicting yourself. If I am required to ask permission to do something (passport), then, ipso-facto, I am not \"allowed\" to do it. The idea that I would be \"allowed\" to move beyond those borders with permission implicitly asserts that the corporation has the right to deny me access, which is the exact opposite of me being \"allowed\" to cross those borders. Let\\'s say you didn\\'t even need a passport, and you could just freely move across borders - that is irrelevant to the question of how the corporation behaves within those borders. Building walls and having checkpoints on the borders is just one more example of criminal behavior on the part of these corporations. Much like \"taxation\", it is something that, if you or I attempted to do to a third party, it would immediately be recognized as criminal behavior.\"So taxes may be involuntary, but they are a necessary evil\"Whether you believe it is \"necessary\" is irrelevant. It has been argued that the black market is \"necessary\", as well, but that is irrelevant to whether it is criminal. Slavery was once thought of as a \"necessary evil\", but that doesn\\'t change the nature of slavery.Also, you forget that it is not \"the people\" government spends money on, as there is no such thing as \\'the people\". The government takes money from SOME people and uses it to benefit OTHER people. The size of the groups involved are irrelevant. For instance, not all people agree with you that taxes are \"accepted as necessary evils\".Even if that money was spent to improve society, and that 99.99% of the population approves of the spending, it is still a violation of the law unless we allow for an exemption - you even admit this yourself by calling taxation a necessary \"evil\". What is \"evil\" about being consistent with our values and rules? For us to consider it \"evil\", it must be a violation of our value system.\" That being said all governments are NOT criminal organizations because governments are liable to the laws they pass\"...except the ones that have exemptions that allow them to violate the law, which, I still maintain, is all of them. I freely acknowledge that government agencies and individuals working for government are subject to some of the laws that the rest of us are. However, a criminal is still a criminal if he breaks even one criminal law, regardless of how many laws he obeys. If that criminal could decide what the laws are, there is no reason for him to give himself an exemption for laws he doesn\\'t want to violate - just the ones preventing stealing, intimidation, racketeering, etc... just like governments do.\"Those governments are not criminal organizations because even though they create laws and enforce them, have rights over a region, and collect taxes, they are fictional governments and thus are not criminal organizations even though they count as governments.\"There are many fictional crime families out there. To the extent that they are fictional, their crimes are fictional, but that doesn\\'t change the fact that they are criminal. What you are essentially saying:In order to argue your case, you have done the following: Claimed that law enforcement (law enFORCEment) has nothing to do with force, violence, or intimidation, even though the exact opposite is demonstrably true. Claimed that taxation is a \"special case\" because \"the people\" (ie, you, and people who agree with you) consider it a \\'necessary evil\\'. In other words, it is exempt from our standards and is \"legal\" even though it violates other laws - exactly my point. Used fictional (FICTIONAL!) governments as examples of governments which are not criminal (even though they still are criminal as fictional governments). In short, you have produced no compelling reasons to dismiss my arguments. * http://reason.com...']\n",

            "['Hello, Fred. This is one of my favorite subjects, and I am glad to have this debate with you. The photons emitting from my computer screen have triggered a complicated cause and effect, resulting in me accepting the challenge. I would like to start off by establishing what free will is. We are discussing the theoretical ability of the mind to make decisions of its own, and to control its own fate. I would now like to speculate on the nature of a mind. Its home is the brain. The brain is a physical object, which acts like any other physical object. Chemical reactions occur within it, which makes our \"decisions\" and \"thoughts\". You will refute by saying that we control our decisions. If you see a plate of food in front of you would eat it, right? If there was no plate of food there, would you have still made the decision to eat it? No. Of course not, several things, including the smell of the food, and your vision that reveals the food, CAUSED you to eat it. The brain is such an endlessly complex thing, but it still follows rules and cause and effect just like anything else. The nature of this speculation is incredible, as it is that of a brain pondering on the workings of it. We can, of course, never fully understand and predict the complex chemical reactions of a brain. Because we may not predict it, we assume it controls its own fate. The same may be applied to the rolling of a die. No man can predict what number it will land on when tossed across a game- board. We perceive it to be random. Though it is obvious that it is not random, and the die still follows the laws of physics, and every little crumb on the table that the die comes across, causes the die to make a slightly different course. Let\\'s look back to history, shall we? In the very early ages, before science, people would perceive that things such as rain were the will of gods, and would dance and what not for rain. Of course none of them could perceive of water being held in clouds, evaporation or what not, so they assume that the rain has a will of its own. In our advanced era, we know that rain is caused by a predictable system of cause and effect. How is our brain any different? I have no wish to turn this into a theological debate, for I am an atheist. I will note however, that there is in fact, theological determinism. You should look it up. It is the belief that god controls the actions of Humans. wrote more ethic and sci can post round 1 or in comments. prefference?', 'Hello, In actuality, what is later discovered to be invalid was in fact invalid from the start, but this is irrelevant. Instinct and what you perceive to be \"rational thought\" (but what is really just extremely complex cause and effect which appear to be rational) are deeply intermingled. No, you either did do as I proposed, or you didn\\'t, and to the fortune of your co-workers you did the latter. It is not as if you \"could\" have done something else. At the time, I could not predict the future (My mind did not know all the variables), and thus was not positive which crossroad events would inevitably take, and it may have been perceived by some, that it was random, or that events chose the crossroad. But now, that we can look back to the past (based on memory) and observe the outcome, we can reasonably conclude that the equation could only add up to your un-compliance with my friendly suggestion. Let me explain this mathematically: We will use a simple equation for this experiment, quite unlike the complex equations of the mind. The equation is: 2+3. We, in this context, know all variables involved: 2 and 3. Using our knowledge of all the variables in question, and our mind\\'s amazing computing ability, we can predict the future and say it will equal 5. This is a much simplified version, however. In reality, being the humans with oh so limited minds; we would NOT know all the variables. Let\\'s say that we only knew the existence of 2. We would not know what all variables might be included, so estimates of the results could be any figure. We cannot predict the outcome with the limited info. After the thing itself happened, and we observed that it was 5 that ended up happening, we know that it could not have been anything else that was the answer, for 2+3, despite your philosophies WILL ALWAYS equal 5. According to your ideas, 2+3, could \"choose\" to equal 7, or 10, or 23,476,353,658,346. This is obviously untrue. Series of events, in actuality follow one path, there are no crossroads; the crossroads are just illusions. And this is the easiest answer to the question of free will, and we may conclude that free-will does not exist. The mind does not control math. Math is undisputable. You cannot deny the logic I have provided above. To answer your question, 2 and 3 force you to choose something. The matter of free-will is not about forcing to do something against your will; it is about forcing your will to do whatever. It makes you \"choose\" what you choose. I have proved that the mind is not infinite, but 2+3 cannot equal an infinite amount of things, it can only equal one thing. If it was infinite, my mind could control the universe (and trust me, if I controlled the universe, things would be a lot more amusing). The computer is indeed a good analogy for the brain, because the computer, like the brain, has no free will. Your analogy seems to agree with my side. Anyways, I suppose it would be \"possible\", as in we don\\'t know for sure any variables that deny it, but I strongly doubt that the equation of events will equal humans building such a computer. There are many variables including even such things as the human race being wiped out before we reached the level of technology. AS for your differentiation between Humans and other animals, I say: a brain is a brain, brains don\\'t have freewill. Look at this article: http://www.apa.org... It shows how similar human and chimpanzee brains are. You earlier proposed a sort of \"micro evolution\", evolution takes millions of years, Fred. So we can reasonably look back…6 thousand years and conclude that human\\'s brains are not dissimilar from humans. Infants born and raised today constantly are raised in the environment of the information age. The minds of 6 thousand years ago, which we can conclude are basically the same as now, lived as animals, so I do not see your connection. Fred, I am dearly sorry, but I can not explain to you all the variables involved in the decisions and psychological processes of gamblers, and drunkards. You keep asking for a simple explanation of why the gambler does something, and someone else does another thing, but I can\\'t give a simple explanation of these processes. Those statements do not necessarily disagree with my arguments. Brain tissue can change shape. You CANT defy nature, Fred. Nature is to broad a sense. Nature is simply the nature of how things are, how they work and why they exist in such a form. You\\'re brain cells do not choose in what direction they go, or how they multiply. You drastically misunderstood my last paragraph (not your fault, just the confusion of limited man-made language). I was not complaining that you were asking \"why\" to much, I was complaining that you WERE NOT asking \"why\" enough, I think that you are not asking \"Why\" enough. I want you to ask \"why\" more. Does it make sense to you now? -Harlan', 'Hello Science itself, by definition can not be mistaken, while scientific theories can be disproved (thus eliminating the \"Science\" element of it). The idea that people use free will to decide whether they want free will is ludicrous (it is like saying, \"vote no if you don\\'t want democracy\"). A thought can certainly cause another thought to form. All a \"thought\" is, is the complex-calculator-that-is-the-mind\\'s process that you are aware of. Assuming that you were \"sane\" (a relevant term, mind you), my mind concluded that you would not be able to carry out my thoughtful suggestion. I was right. You could not do it. Your mind kept you from doing it. \"While I could very well choose to do any of those things that you suggest, I would more than likely choose not to do them\" You \"could\" have done them? If our world fo0llows cause and vent, I was aware that if something in the past did or did not happen, there was no other possible course of events, as there is no such thing as randomness. You \"more than likely\" would have done what you did? Things are not random, Fred. Things only happen if things cause them to happen. Are you saying that the mind has infinite possibilities? This is obviously not true…the mind is limited at some point. Do not get me wrong, the Human mind has a very complex system for deciding courses of action, but not infinite. Well, it depends what you mean by \"infinite\", for inside the number 1, there is an infinite amount of variations (1.1, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, 1.00001, 1.000001, 1.132432543246322542523) The mind is not capable of everything, though. Theoretically, the human mind could be predicted, but because of the chaos theory, it would be INCREDIBLY difficult, but once more, the Human mind is not capable of everything, and it would take well over a lifetime (WELL, well over) to factor in and understand all the variables in the universe, for one moment in time. I doubt that we will create a computer if such computing power, because where would we get all the information? You can not fit a universe in a computer. Way, way too much information. It is probably not something we could do. Though strictly theoretically, it is \"possible\". How could I make the assertion that you would not do the actions I asked of you to take? Of course I did not know all the variables of the Universe, and thus I was not sure, but I knew that few minds were allowed to work in this manner, though some might be forced to. I do not believe in such a thing as a god \"investing\" free will in someone (side-note: who put the freewill in the god?). While we are in a scientific debate, you must agree that a Human is an animal. You stated yourself: \"animals do not have free will\". Do you concede, then? Or do you take that back? Or would you make the argument that scientifically Humans are not animals (which is unfactual)? Or do you revise that statement to say: \"animals, exempt Humans, do not have freewill\". I would be OK with this. Though our brains work the exact same way as other animals. The purpose of quoting Einstein was that not only does he have great understanding of things, and would be a great person for input, he summed it up very nicely. God does not play dice indeed, and accordingly nothing is random or happening for no reason, thus there being no freewill. Since we are debating with the context of science, the scientific world is a logical one. In this world (our world) things happen because things made them happen, not because they decide to happen. No offense, but I don\\'t think you\\'re going deep enough, Fred. You must keep asking \"why\" on every aspect. WHY do we do this? WHY does our mind decide that? WHAT made it decide that? WHY did it make it decide that? Things happen for reasons. You are just floating on the surface when you say that the mind has memories, but somehow those brain cells decide their own fate. You need to delve, and try to find the reason for each and every aspect. And therein lies the answer, everything has a reason, and thus the brain cells cannot decide their own fate. -Harlan']\n",
            "['This topic has been discussed since the earliest of times and involves religious, ethical, and scientific implications. In the realm of theology, the Creator does not assert His omnipotent power over individual will thereby allowing humans to make choices. On an ethical plane, without free will, how can we hold anyone morally accountable for their actions. While great strides have been made in scientifically mapping the thought process, the actions of the body are not wholly determined by physical causality. The question is: Does the machine (brain) control the soul or does the soul control the machine? In contemplating on whether or not to issue this challenge, I weighed all of the options and possibilities (consequences) of my contemplated action and decided to go ahead and issue the challenge. My intention is not to win or loose the debate, but supply a forum where ideas can be freely exchanged in a refreshing, open atmosphere without rancor.', 'Harlan, the definition of science is:\" ability to produce solutions in some problem domain.\" It is a fact that solutions that were valid yesterday, may become invalid today based upon further research. Sometimes, the scientist comes to a conclusion based upon flawed data making his conclusion invalid – or a mistake. I don\\'t think I said people decide on whether or not they want free will. I do say that man has the ability to use free will, or he can choose not to thereby utilizing only that portion of his brain that responds to instinct, the reptilian brain. A thought certainly can form another thought. \"I think I will write a book,\" may produce another thought: \"What kind of book will I write?\" I am glad that you assumed that I am sane. In doing so you might have even placed a wager on my response because, being sane, why would I want to do things that are considered by most to be insane? The fact remains that I could have done some of those things you proposed (I once danced onstage acting like a stripper akin to wearing a pink tutu to work) but I considered the consequences and decided they were not things that I should do, especially at work! What would force me to do something that I choose not to do? I truly believe that the power of the mind is infinite. The more we use it, the better we get at doing things. Doesn\\'t it seem that each generation seems \"smarter\" than the previous ones? Perhaps we are observing a micro-second of evolution? When computers first were developed, they were the size of a room. Today, I am working on a minuscule laptop going at corvette speeds compared to the model T speed of the older ones. Computers will continually evolve into smarter, faster machines because someone decided to study and research computer technology and take it to the next level by experimentation. If it is theoretically possible, then it can be done…we just haven\\'t figured out how yet! Again, we will leave the origin of free will to the theological debate and remain in the scientific realm. Miriam-Webster defines human as \"of, relating to, or characteristic of humans: a: having human form or attributes b: susceptible to or representative of the sympathies and frailties of human nature.\" An example would be all Native Americans are Native Americans, but not all are Wampanoag Native Americans. Something sets them apart. While man may be described as a \"bi-pedal mammal\" something sets us apart from all other mammals: our ability to make decisions, to make choices, to exercise free will. We can ask the questions: \"Who? What? Why? What are the consequences? Then we can decide to act, or not act. I am an addict (alcohol being a drug)science tells me that I inherited a genetic makeup that made me so. Science can demonstrate that prolonged use of the drug causes further alterations within my brain chemistry. That makes sense. I took something that caused a change that effected my brain. However, a pathological gambler never ingests anything yet science shows the same brain chemistry changes as the alcoholic. But, the pathological gambler never ingested anything to cause the effect on the brain. His repetitive behavior (or, thinking)did. Sort of like mind over matter, wouldn\\'t you say? By doing certain things over and over again I have developed a newer habit (sobriety) that defies my genetic nature and the changes caused to my brain chemistry by continued use of the drug. Certainly not an easy feat but I haven\\'t had a drink in almost seven years. Defies nature, don\\'t you think? The fact is I first tried recovery back in 1998 but I only have seven years of \"clean time.\" Recovery didn\\'t work until I chose to do the things necessary to make it work despite my genetic makeup! I chose! Things (planets, trees, etc.) certainly do not make things work. I make things work by using my intellect and my freedom to choose what to make work. Perhaps, Harlan, my \"why\" questions are meant for you to think about my statements in a different way than you have in the past. Everything does have a reason but man has not been able to discover every reason just yet. Logical is defined as being \"capable of or reflecting the capability for correct and valid reasoning; a logical mind.\" Truth is, life can be illogical at times.']\n"
